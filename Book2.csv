Estate agents who engaged meaningfully with tenants 
A better way to get tenants to pay for the damage they do to properties.
Longer term tenure confirmed at application
Housing affordability and moving costs
repairs getting done quickly.
"Less inspections once you are past an initial probation period

Not including number of children on application (discrimination against families with larger numbers even though it can’t be proved)"
More respect for tenants as consumers of a service with rights rather than being treated like second class citizens. Very quick to take my money - slow to respond to concerns (Inc significant safety issues) that would cost the landlord any money.  
Allowing tenants to have pets. 
"There is two. Encourage longer term rentals, ie 3+ Years & make it easier to have pets. "
"Flexible fixed term lease periods (most only allow 12 months, and our lives don’t revolve around 12 month periods, forcing us into extremely expensive break lease situations), and making it easier to allow renters to have pets or hang pictures (it is impossible to make a rental feel like a home environment because of strict stipulations, and most of us will never be able to afford our own home)"
one stop application form accepted by all agencies
Cheaper rents for people in benefits 
Have rules on cleanliness and upkeep for landlords
"A fairer experience when it comes to renting and being able to make the rental house your home, every realtor we have experienced has had the interests of the property owners first and foremost leaving repairs to be done 6 months after they have been notified. "
More communication between owners and tenants. 
The price of renting is ridiculous.
"No restrictions on pets. I was from Victoria and they allowed anyone to rent properties and have pets with some minor restrictions. It is the major thing that is hard for me to be able to find a place that can allow me to possess my pets which currently have to stay in Victoria as a result. Even with my current rental situation that allows pets, there is heavy restrictions on that as well which has been an issue too. "
"Pets to be allowed inside as long as tenant keeps place clean.
Also 
Owners to keep property to safe standards (like safety cutoff switch for stove tops and dead trees cleared. We tell agent but still waiting one year on for issues to be sorted)

And 
Not Charging top dollar for house that needs renovations"
"That agents don't treat tenants as third class citizens and treat them as equals.
Agents always favour the landlord and treat the tenants with contempt. 
Agents also often withhold bond money unfairly to favour landlords. "
The current system favours property managers and landlords. Rent controls often provide a culture for landlords to end a lease at the end of the term due to potential of increasing rent on a new tenant over a small incremental increase in the existing. It becomes extremely expensive to all of us. 
"Reasonable pricing especially for older properties.
A standard of treatment and maintenance from owners/landlords.
"
Invasive checks on precious employment that are not necessary. 
Prices need to go down. Also if someone has an excellent rental history having pets should not be judged. Some people take responsibility for their animals. 
Landlords and property managers should be more aware of and care about their legal obligations to tenants.
Allowing a dog in more properties (they often cause a lot less damage than children!)
"Less inspections, every 3 months is a bit full on, at times.. "
Communication between tenants and property managers - no matter which real estate I’ve rented through they never get back to you
Butcher Behaviour of real state agent .
Make it so that rent can't be increased more then once in a 12mth period
Real estate accountability/ transparency 
Better standards relating to tenant rights; especially regarding the inability to negotiate frequent rent increases that rise faster than our incomes.
Reduce the price per week.
Better ventilation with smoking only allowed behind their closed doors. 
There is a lack of quality rentals within a reasonable budget 
Align property maintenance regulations with that of the UK
"Landlords to allow tenants to live in their home as if it was the tenants own home.  As an aging tenant to be able to install safety rails in both bathrooms, at tenants expense, to be a permanent fixture should be allowed and not frowned upon."
Allow pets as a right like Victoria.
"More rights living in rentals- we are unable to hang picture frames etc, most places you cannot have pets. Your home can feel quite bland and bare and even though we don’t own it, we are paying the rent to live in a home we can’t really decorate or have pets in."
"My single biggest issue is the lack of privacy considered to tenants with regards to repairs and inspections. No Home owner would allow someone in their house while they weren’t home. Yet tenants aren’t provided with the same consideration. Property owners hand out keys for tradesmen to enter the property even if we’re not home, and property managers refuse to negotiate on inspection times to allow us to be present."
To have a channel for tenants to provide feedback to the real wastage agency and being empowered and protected by the legislation when renting from others/agency
Making it easier for tenants to have pets - while our current rental allows pets it may be difficult in the future to find a property which also allows pets if we have to move. 
More freedom when the lease is ending to be able to move to a periodic lease at the end of a fixed term. At present I receive a notice to leave if I don’t sign a new lease on the agents/landlords terms 3 months before the end of the current lease without any consultation as to what my plans or expectations are. 
To have access to an Australian wide database where potential tenants have some sort of rental rating (similar to a credit rating)
More Accountability on the owner. People don’t speak up for fear of being kicked out
Have the people that live in our unit complex be more considerate of noise 
Allowed to haves pets 
No pressure to sign 12 month contracts over a 6 month 
Make it easier and faster to transfer bonds from old rental property to new rental property when relocating.
Having repairs completed in a timely manner once reported to real estate/owner.
Better ability to remove problem tenants and make them pay for damages. 
Better efficiency from Rental company
All rentals allowing pets
The ability to hang photos and plant flowers.
More properties available to allow pets and be able to put a veggie garden in the ground
"Long term leases more common, with more permanent home rules and regulations. "
Routine inspections are stressful and while I know they have to be done to protect the owners interest I always worry the house isn't clean enough. Some of my friends take time off work just to clean for an inspection
"Emulate Victoria.
I can't make even the most basic of temporary modifications without a go-ahead. It's incredibly difficult to find a place that allows pets."
"I think bodies corporate have too much power over what residents can and cannot do, and don’t engage enough with residents. This results in those bodies being out of touch with the wants and needs of residents. "
I would make pets acceptable without the conditions that are now in place. I would also like to have more say over when and how people are entitled to enter my home.
Rental prices need to reflect the wages and economic circumstances of the tenants in the area better and there needs to be a way to hold real estate agents to account when they are breaking the rules.
Real estates that actually care about the lessor not just keeping an account with the land lord.
"Realestate agent to actually do their job 
Realestate agents to be decent and respectful 
Property’s to be repainted every 2 years and "
Stop allowing real estate agents to threaten you with court and take your bond if you don't pay someone six hundred dollars to do a bond clean. Particularly since they have all the time in the world to submit documents to the RTA while your at work and busy running your life. Offices to assist you are only open during work hours!
Lack of tenant rights
Landlord agents treating us badly and not repairing building
Be able to have a cat in apartments. 
Repairs to be carried out speedily & by professional people
For the landlord to be accountable for non-emergency repairs to the /infrastructure of the house/. 
"a more personalised experience, we are usually just a peace of paper in the hands of the agency! very rare are the agent who will try to contact you, know you, help you
Our rental is NEVER our home, never: we can't put anything on the wall, so we can't never personalised our place for example
and if we have pets it become a nightmare to try to find a place for us and our pets"
"The ability to have firmer action in regards to neighbouring properties in unit, town housing."
Easier application process 
"i think all rental  properties shoulkd  be a licenced  premises  ,that is the landloard  has to apply for a  rental licence on each premise he//she makes available for rent  and Fair  rent  be subject to  the building plans that the landlord  must submit to show the  size of rooms    common   space  kitchen   area  ,this  being  able to say well the going rent for this area  is x  amount of dollars and thats what  the rent is  in  rubbish  if a  premise is dated back to the 70  and a  new rental  unit  how can they  boith  be of eual rent  ,just becayse  a  real estate  salesperson says weell thats the rent  for this area  "
more pet approved properties
"Cheaper bonds, more pet friendly homes"
Give landlords better protections. Too many times tenants have more protections
More laws enforcing repairs and maintenance of rental properties. 
"Stop one real estate dominating the the rental market in one region. Both areas I have lived in are regional communities, and when they dominate the market of that area, they push the boundaries of the laws"
Limited choices of home within budget that allow pets
Have more security in relation to control over my tenancy. Landlords have too much control with being able to issue a notice to quit without giving a reason.
"Landlords should have to pay a deposit with the real estate so if there's something that needs to be fixed quickly the money is there. 
Also there needs to be a register for tenants to access regarding the past behavior of estate agents/landlords just like they can check on tenants. My last rental property was a nightmare. It took weeks to get the hot water system fixed, a hole in the floor from termite damage only got fixed when we moved out and I had to issue a breech notice for a refund on an emergency repair. That only got paid when I told them I was going to take the next step. After moving out I heard heaps of stories from other renters that this agency was woeful. It would be good to have something official to check and and not just make judgements based on rumours. "
Penalties against property managers
not feeling relaxed as agent and/or landlord had control
The thing I'd like to change is always being under the assumption that all tenants are horrible people who cause damage to the property. When you leave a rental property it's a massive fight to prove that the damage is there originally as we have experienced the account manager not even looking at the entry reports. When they say jump you ask how high... 
Greater allowances made for owning a pet
"I would like the ability to have a pet (a small dog or a cat) to assuage my lonliness and provide me with a companion.  I have lived with a mental health issue for more than 15 years and live in social housing, and pet ownership has been proven to alleviate my condition."
"abandon the ""break lease"" scenario"
Have landlords that fix things quickly.
"Allow pets without needing permission.
Stricter regulations on property managers and how they treat tenants.
Have the ability to transfer bonds.
Tanant should receive interest from long term bonds invested."
Transparency with Real Estate Agents
Have things repaired in a timely manner
Reconsider privacy issues.
More tenants rights that allow everyone no matter what form of housing to have a positive experience renting
"More information of what the obligations are for the tenants and real estate or rental parties in everything like maintenance, property up keep, routine inspections"
there needs too be more communication with tenants about there rights.
"As a tenant, I would prefer the option to continue on a periodic lease instead of perpetually having to sign up for fixed term tenancies. The latter makes it difficult to find a better flat if you don’t like the one you’re in."
I have had nothing but good fair experiences so far with both renting agencies and owners
Be able to rent senior housing that is affordable easier. On an aged pension I was told I wasn’t elegible for public housing
Real estate agents responding to building concerns/requests. 
"Have longer lease periods become the norm not exception. Moving every few years is a huge financial drain, unsettling for children and doesn’t allow tenants to feel a sense of ‘home’. "
Training and accountability for real estate industry
Property managers held to account for poor service and non-compliance with tenancy laws. 
More permancy in renting.  We tend to have to move every couple of years 
The landlords have no requirement to actually do what they are supposed to do and keep the house in good working order. 
More pet-friendly rentals
"Increase time between inspections,  every 3 months becomes a feeling of a privacy issue"
Tenants need to be more accountable for damage and unpaid rent and bonds need to increase.
Lessen discrimination of owning a pet.
Relax the rules on pets. There are so much fewer rentals available to pet owners
Need a central renting area so I only need to fill out one form for all realestate instead of doing multiple forms for each realestate.
Greater ability to recoup costs for damages by tenants - perhaps via an insurance system (funded by the tenant) in lieu of a bond. It shouldn't be the responsibility of the landlord to purchase expensive landlord insurance to cover damage by tenants - that removes the mutual obligation part of the rental equation.
Better understanding agents
Easier bond management
"Pets, over the years I have had to rent real dumps just to be able to keep my pet."
The expectation of owners/property managers regarding the condition of the property on exit.
"I would prefer not to have my life invaded and judged by agents. I understand the need for inspections to make sure there is no damage to the property but whether you have perfect lawns/gardens or clutter should not be an issue unless it is damaging the property. Every 12 weeks is too much. To begin with sure, 3 monthly but once you've been living somewhere for a year with no issues then yearly inspections should suffice. It is invasive and a breach of privacy when photos are taken."
"being able to make it feel more of a home...placing photo's, adding to the gardens etc to make it ""mine"" while living there."
Drop rental prices
Owners being more open to fixing maintenance issues properly
I would like the option to sign a 5-10 year lease.  A 12 month lease does not provide security or stability for either the owner nor the renter.  
"Real estate agents/Property manager's attitudes. I have had terrible trouble with these people, been treated unfairly and with contempt. Any time I have rented directly through the owner of the property I have had no problems. The afore mentioned people need better training and screening for unacceptable attitudes."
Greedy property managers that break the laws
The costs are very high and usually increase every year. the contacts are weighted on the lesee.
Making sure all houses are secure with security screens. And making the tenants comfortable with air conditioning as a MUST have ln all houses due to the strong humidity and weather conditions in summer. 
Fairer property managers. Pets allowed. Cheaper rent.
"Breaking lease rules need to change, circumstances change without warning and at a drop of the hat, sometimes leaving the renter 1000’s of dollars out of pocket, the rule that tenant has to pay rent until a new tenant has been found is absolutely ridiculous. It should be capped at a time period like two weeks "
Availability of quality affordable housing
Having more houses that accepts pets. 
Exit inspections and bond returns
"The house we lived in had a major issue with plumbing. The Real Estate blamed us and tried to force us to make major repairs on the property. Taking the matter to QCAT, the adjudicator allowed us to terminate our lease, but gave very little compensation for the sudden move we had to make, or the inconvenience of the Real Estate not honouring the maintenance terms of our lease. The adjudicator said we would have to move at some point anyway."
Greater security for tenants 
Make it easy for families like myself to be able to rent we pay 520 a week and the pool needs to be fixed and compliant communication is really bad from the real estate wall paper on the walls and peeling cupboard doors falling off dishwasher dose not work all have been reported but nothing done so I don’t see why we have to pay so much when nothing gets done 
Allow pets inside. 
Improved responsiveness from landlords when there is an issue with the property. 
"Being able to make the house a ""home"" "
"More affordable housing, pet friendly housing"
Easier bond returns and penalties for real estate agents who clearly break the law
Allowed to have pets inside. And to hang pictures on walls. 
"Remove the ability of agents and landlords to issue a notice to leave without grounds. In my experience, it  is used vindictively by many agencies and owners. "
Better recourse for landlords against tenants who damage property or don’t pay all money owing over and above the rental bond.
"If I could only pick one thing it would be no grounds eviction. I should be able to live in the home I'm paying for without fear of being kicked out without breaching the contract we both signed. 
 "
The stigma that young renters with a dog are less responsible/clean than a family with kids.
Better accessibility to properties when you are a responsible pet owner (and can provide proof of this). 
"Permission to keep a small pet (cat, small dog)"
Better support and advocacy from real estate when dealing with issues. 
Heavy handed legal tactics of rental agencies such as Ray White who insist on signing a new lease within 7 days (with 2mths left on current lease) or be given a notice to Quit.
Easier resolution process between tenants and landlords 
Responsibilities of the landlords and agents 
Better assistance RTA
Wish more places would allow pets. 
Tenants should be allowed to have pets
Less turnover of property managers
"I feel that landlords sometimes treat rental bond money as a bonus at the end of the tenancy. If landlords take rental bond they should have to demonstrate that the money is being used to fix the alleged damage to the property, and not just going into their pockets or being used as an excuse to improve their property (e.g. ""I would like to have this room repainted so I will say this mark on the wall requires the entire room to be repainted)."
"Having inspections less often if your a good tenant, long term renter. I.e, every 6 months "
The insecurity of not knowing if the rental will continue from lease to lease and if the rent will still be affordable
Make all properties pet friendly 
Improved rent control on cost and conditions
"Renters need more control and security. We have no control over whether we have pets, or whether we can hang a curtain or a picture, or paint a feature wall. Often landlords will impose conditions even on what we do in the garden. We need longer leases as standard (I'd welcome a 5 year lease just for the security) and the ability to make reasonable changes that we feel are necessary in the house."
"Initial assistance in attempting to secure a rental.
Moved to QLD from VIC late 2017 and found that because of supply & demand that rental prices seemed exhorbitant compared to Melbourne metro and VIC real estate agents were far more helpful in finding a rental specifically for our needs.
"
Putting things in walls
Process required by agents to submit application
Annual rent increase
Stop landlords from discriminating against pets and children
Ensure landlords continue the upkeep of their properties to a livable standard 
Ability to end a lease earlier if required with say 2 months notice without reason. 
Having non urgent repairs or updating such as paints and carpets done
"1) even though it may not be my property, it is my home , i beleave that when a property manager comes to in spect they should respect that it is my home and they should remove there shoes before entering ""if asked"" as they expect that we look after the floors and don't mark them or stain the carpet, (that resect to the tenant)
A good tenant is a customer and should be treated so.
  "
Paying for part water not all
Laws to control tenant noise in a unit complex with same owner. Greater ability for property managers to intervene regarding noise 
"More rights to tenants to live their lives in their rentals: painting, hanging paintings/pictures, making minor improvements, keeping a pet, etc. "
We have had a great experience so far and have a really good management company to work with. 
allow pets inside house
"The price per week, each year the price of rent goes up $10 per week when it comes to lease renewal. It is almost they know when  you have a family with small kids or a child with a disability (I have both) the real estate knows it is hard for us to move so they put up the rent knowing we really have no choice but to renew the lease and pay the extra rent per week. "
"Tenates having more rights.
Real Estates being more closely monitored. "
attitude of real estate agents to single parents
"More transparency in landlord owner expectations especially with inspections
Right of reply if issues with vacate "
"As a landlord I would increase the bond requirements especially when there are pets involved - pets are an optional lifestyle choice not a necessity and therefore should be subject to increased fiscal penalties and responsibilities placed on owners. I have experienced positive and negative outcomes renting my property to tenants with pets and the reality is pets (especially cats) defecate in the premises and required excessive remediation and floor covering replacements when tenants exit. Current bond levels do not allow for this and having to invoke landlord insurance, paying excess, and the inconvenience of property downtime and not earning income while remediation occurs makes it uneconomical and very risky to rent to tenants with pets. Outside Dogs, a bird in a cage, or a fish tank are all benign but I will never rent my premises to tenants with indoor dogs & all cats regardless of what laws are introduced as they simply cannot be controlled."
"Having decent tenants who respect the property, use common sense and keep the property at the same standard as when they occupied.  In short don't abuse the property and the goodwill of the owner."
Allow pets in all rentals 
"Amounts charged for rent, bond and associated connections"
Look at the ridiculous cost of renting
The constant raising of rent when it comes time to sign the lease again.
"There is currently no option to pay a higher bond and/or rent to enable pet ownership, building minor modifications or any other changes to make a rental property a true home."
"Be allowed to have 1 pet, be allowed to do some superficial decoration, have property manager inspections every 6 months rather than every 3 months, in particular after being a long term tenant in the same property (7 years in my case).  Be allowed to use the Bond for the next rental Bond (transfer).  Moving house is an expensive undertaking and coming up with an additional 4 weeks rent is excessive, when there is already a Bond in place.  Have rent move up or down according to area trends and not just up because the property manager/owner so decide (to increase it)."
"Make the courts accountable and NOT use lies to ""steal"" someone's bond. 
RTA always backs the real estates."
More properties allowing pets
be nice to be able to talk to my tenant without going through the agent
"Pets,reduce rent prices, when kibibg our be more accommodating to wear n tear ur, carpets, walls etc"
Easier to rent property when you have a dog. I find it hard to find suitable accomodation when I have a dog.
"Reduce red tape, too many rules."
Be allowed to hang pictures and have pets as well as get repairs done quickly 
quicker repairs and maintenance
All rental payment should be able to be made by direct debit without any added fees for every property.
Make it pet friendly and affordable for single over 50s
Having more NRAS  houses or units available
Better able to screen managing agents.
Longer rental periods
Pet friendly properties. Longer leases.
Longer term leases
Less frequent inspections 
Be allowed to have a cat and a dog
Not so many inspections if you already know that we are very neat and tidy to start with on every single inspection. 
Rental lease should run for between 5 and 10 years. Inspections should be limited to: the first year of lease anniversary then every second year after that. Tenants should be able to quit their lease early with no penalty if they accept a job more than 1 hour drive from the leased property. Tenants should be able to quit their lease early with no penalty if their children change schools. Tenants should be allowed to extend their lease to allow children to finish their education at their present school. 
More properties allowing pets. It’s hard to find somewhere to rent who will allow my 2 little Dachshunds. I would never give them up so we are forced to seek lower living standards to keep our pets with us whilst renting. (My husband and I have 3 kids so it’s a shame to have to lower our living standards just to keep our beloved pets). 
I would like to keep pets in whatever house I rent
Rent control..... My landlord can choose to increase my rent every year. 
"More rentals with pets welcome, longer leases"
"Would like to have the ability to change decor and fittings without having to go through a process of writing to the agent...then more often than not, having the agent and/or owner visit to offer a poor compromised solution - so I can live in a 'Home' not just a property."
I would love to be able to make very small changes to the property (ie: add picture hooks) to make it feel more like home. 
Harder for landlords to give out short-term (6 months - 1 year) leases
"I want to be empowered to make decisions about the place where I live and how I can live there. it is justified that no damage be caused to the property, but unfair that someone else can put conditions on things like pets, pictures on the well, and taking photographs and films during inspections of the home we rent. Renting makes you feel unequal."
"Have more say in reasonable exit and entry forms, this one the real estate took photos of the inside of the toilet...... we are in our 60 s , I think I know how clean a toilet should be kept..."
Being allowed and indoor cat. I don't understand what the issue is with it given tenants are responsible for everything when they leave the property anyways. 
The unreasonable things agents will complain during house inspection for example complaining about streak on shower doors. 
"Allowing tenants more freedom to hang pictures on walls, have pets and longer leases.
Quicker repairs, not charging for water."
More honesty within the real estates. More accurate condition entry reports. Less of real estates trying to keep tennants bond for things which are just rediculous money grabbing efforts.
"It’s so hard these days to find a rental property. You’re virtually unable to rent if you have a pet, real estates rarely help the tenant and the rules always swing in favour of the landlord "
I feel landlords and agents have a great deal of power over tenants and they can be unreasonable in times of need. 
More properties that allow pets
Real estate agents to have less say in the decision making and allow more consultation or input between owners and prospective tenants. Example the owner accepted our application but the real estate agent did not. So we missed out on an opportunity to get a rental property for my family. 
Pets allowed. More reasonable renting prices. Better maintenance on rental properties. 
Better upkeep and speeding responses on the structural maintenance of rental properties. 
Make it more pet friendly and cheaper
"Having a longer Lease period. Every 12 months, we literally hold our breath until we receive the papers to renew our Lease for a further 12 months. It is at this point every years that our home becomes just a rental property! "
Landlord attentiveness to home maintenance needs
More freedom to have a small pet and owners/agents that care about maintaining  house
"Tenant ledgers need to be better regulated. We nearly lost our chance at a new rental because the previous property manager entered our rent payments whenever she got around to it, which meant sometimes it looked like we paid rent 2 weeks late. "
Fairer legislation that does more for landlords rights
"I would change the rates of inspection, the bond refund process, the leasing rules especially regarding things like pets, hanging pictures, and so on. I'd also look at introducing rent control in certain areas where rent has increased exponentially."
"Not needing to seek permission for everything we do in the house - we put up our own curtains because the existing ones had gaping holes. We decided not to hang any paintings because they said they wanted to come and take pictures. When we complained that rodents had chewed the external door, they said it was our problem to fix and we had to call the RTA for backup.  "
"Improve communication, intelligence and perception of Real Estate Representatives"
"Tenure is a major issue. Legislate that all tenancies revert to periodic tenancies at end of first fixed term and that the tenancy is guaranteed to continue if the conditions of the lease are met. Exceptions could of course be incorporated, for example if the property is sold or if a landlord wishes to occupy the residence as their own dwelling. Limitions should also be imposed on rent rises, which can be used as a means of pressuring tenants to leave."
Option for longer tenancy agreements (eg. 2 - 3 years). The possibility of having to move once every 6 months to a year puts a lot of stress on tenants.
Paying for air conditioning as a holiday guest was a terrible shock 
make bond lot larger to cover repairs
The rules and laws should be adapted to reflect that if a tenant rents a property and paying the rent on time he should be have the same rights as a property owner in regarding to treating the place as his/her home.
Require quarterly inspections and rectification of any damage to the property
I would like to hang pictures up whereI want when I want. I want to have a dog (a house dog specifically a Cavalier King Charle). Faster maintenance response. 
Rules favour the landlords
"stop the hike on rents increasing every time a lease runs out and also bidding on rents. I do not know when this started in QUEENSLAND BUT IT WILL HAVE TO STOP. You look at an add in the paper google, You look at adds in papers, letting pages from real estate, or whatever and the next thing is you find out that someone has bided on it and given a higher rental price for the rent of the unite. It is not given on what references you have it is given to the highest bidder. "
Create a database somehow that holds “bogus” property management groups and/or landlords accountable for their disgraceful and targeted behaviour towards some tenants. There is a place where tenants can be “blacklisted” so there should also be a platform or database where property management organisations and/or landlords can also be listed to not rent with.
Allow little changes such as hanging pictures and clocks on walls. No possibility of access to solar power and solar hot water.
Affordable rents and available housing for pensioners.
Would make a stronger amount of laws giving tenants more rights in relation to pets and also for the RTA to have more direct power/s to compel landlords to act on complaints.  
"Free free rental payments - particularly no forcing of using ""services"" that charge monthly fees to ""join"""
"Long leases, having pets being able to make the property home "
extended period security of tenure
Limit the cost of terminating the lease should the property not suite the tenant 
"Pets, picture hooks, less inspections "
"Less often routine inspections
Less strict routine inspections (eg. I've been penalised for having dust on ceiling fans)"
Better safeguards for tenants
More opportunities no more stigma&judgements on low income/unemployed or various other reasons.
Rent at a fixed rate.
Rent not going up every renewal when nothing has been done to improve the property. And being able to transfer your bond when moving house. 
"There is a problem with Real Estate agents and owners using each other as an excuse for not carrying out maintenance and repairs in anything like a timely manner, citing 'difficulties of getting hold of', and also we were recently told by our agents that 'these owners won't do any maintenance that isn't court ordered' - three weeks after we moved in!"
In Queensland there should be at least overhead fans in all rooms if not aircon.
The owner and real estate to be open and honest
Better choice of affordable rentals
For owners to hold previous tenants accountable for not cleaning and leaving a property outdoor living area tidy
Ability to get things fixed that are broken
"Clearer expectations for property inspections.
Property expectations to be carried out by property managers when they are supposed to be carried out."
More incentive for landlords to treat tenants well. Current landlord is great but previous one was happy for place to fall apart around us.
"Pets allowed, online payments"
Increase property values and restore rent in places like Townsville
"Not be forced to take tennents who have pets, we have to give 2 mo ths notice amd they only give 2 weeks. It should be the same for both parties"
Would be great if it was cheaper
more freedom to make it a feel like our home on long term rental agreements. 
"Renters need more rights, particularly around the selling of a property. At our last place we were forced to have open houses every Sunday for five months, plus random open houses with only 24 hours notice. Cause us great stress."
Ability for responsible tenants to have indoor pets. 
Tenants who damage property should have to pay for the repairs even if it is more than the bond. Winning in court solves nothing when the tenant disappears to ruin another property.
"I have to pay a holding deposit to rent? So that's yet more money that a tenant needs upfront as well as the rental bond and first month's rent.
The laws are in place to secure rich people's investments, ignoring the working class and poor who have no resources to defend themselves against corruption and bullying."
More freedom and choice about where we want to live. Numerous places don’t allow pets which is hard. We’d also love to be able to put up picture hooks 
"My bad experienced towards the real estate in varsity lake , it call Robina Village Real Estate under the name of Lia Jurianz, shes a bully real estate I ever deal with, thank god im not dealing with her anymore, but you ppl need to address the issue to her directly for being a bully."
Security of long term tenancy.
Make it compulsory for real estate management to check tenants history through tenants database or blacklists for their clients
"Having a way to confirm that the estate agent has actually discussed your questions/issues with the owner

Allowing pets automatically

Having more reasonable rules about fair wear and tear, IE more leniency.

Make the rules and responsibilities for owners, estate agents and tenants more accessable to tenants with understandable language."
Tenants having more rights when it comes down to having walk throughs.
"The leaving experience can be be horrific. Its incredibly stressful when you dont know if how your agent will react. Will they with hold your bond or no or made up reasons. Or if something is the matter, will it be made into a mountain instead of being able to negtioate.  Moving is already financially stressful. No one wants the added procedure of having to go through the rta. Especially with the threat of being blacklisted or having a negative report hanginf over your head."
I want to be present for exit report on property. Landlords and real estates lie about everything .
We really struggle getting both the real estate and owner to engage with maintenance requests in our current rental. The owner vetos or doesn’t engage and that’s the end of the discussion which is really disappointing. 
"Allow for longer leases, eg 5 years after agreement between landlord and leaser. A 1 year qualifying period should be OK. 
More pressure on Real Estate Agents to do their job properly. It is too easy for the Agent to renew on their duty on behalf of both parties."
rental charges are monitored to keep in line with prices in the area.  I am paying between $50 and $70 more a week than those around me.  Rental prices have dropped but my owner has not dropped the price - he charged me 40 more when I signed the lease as I didn't have a history and was in a situation I needed to find a house to rent  so he took advantage of that.  As prices have fallen his has stayed the same.  I have had to save to cover the cost of moving so I can find somewhere cheaper.  Water usage - tanks do not have to work anymore (changes to legislation) so water costs are creeping up.  My tank wasn't working for over 2 years and I had to pay the water costs all that time.  Owners should be made to fix things in a reasonable time - they don't.
"We have had no issues when we have been the tenant, but as landlords the bad definitely outweighs the good experiences. Make tenants COMPLETELY responsible for everything that happens during their tenancy (ie so they have to treat the place as if the own it!)."
Allowing us to be able to put photos of our children and families on walls. It’s up to us then fix any marks that is left when you vacate the property 
Owners having a minimum quota of upkeep each year. Some units I’ve lived in only get repairs when they are absolutely critical. 
The way real estate agents operate and don’t allow you to live freely coming and wrecking your peace every couple of months to take private photos of my home
Have the ability to break a lease at any time with a max fixed charge of 1 months rent to the owner.
More leniency with owners allowing pets in units.
"Hold landlords/agents responsible to their obligations according to the terms of the contract they sign (rental agreement), rather than just telling tenants their only option is to move out of they're rights are not being met. "
Make it easier for landlords to evict troublesome neighbours.
"100 things on my list, you only want one?
1)  Things never being fixed / addressed in a timely manner, whether from private or commercial landlords.
BONUS 2) Being rejected, time and time again, for either being on Centrelink assistance or having a housemate applying who is on assistance.  It is both distressing and degrading."
"Longer fixed rental terms, having the uncertainty of having to renew every 6/12 months makes renting an uncertain nightmare"
Better Property Managers
Real Estate Agencies to be professionally accountable and to behave responsibly as owner's agent to tenants and owners.
Exit procedures - the house is expected to be in better condition when you exit to when you move in this doesn't allow for normal wear and tear and becomes a totally traumatic event for the tenant.  There absolutely needs to be a proper definition to normal wear and tear and it needs to be defined based on the number of years living in the property.  When owners earn money renting the property the tenant should not have to also compensate them on exit to make up any wear and tear its totally in the owners favour
"It can be challenging finding money for a bond when I have to move. Waiting for a bond refund, on top of the other expenses of moving, presents with some serious financial challenges. If an individual has a 'no claims' or 'no fault' history, a simple bond transfer would assist. Some kind of surety from the State Government to ensure landlords are covered would protect them, even if it meant tenants paying a bond percentage to access this surety. "
Freedom to make changes to the property ( nails for pictures etc) and more houses which allow pets 
Allow minor (easily removed) changes and pet ownership as standard right for tenants
Consistency with paying for water usage.
"Make blacklistings available to all landlords, including small private ones.
Make the eviction process quicker, easier and more effective when things have gone wrong."
"Allowing us to make a home! Not just renting a house. We would like to hang some pictures on the walls, but the hassle and fear of losing our bond stops us."
Allow for longer term rental periods with reduced number of inspections for those of us renting for longer periods (several years). Allow pets. Allow us to hang pictures on the walls. Allow us to create vegie gardens.
Getting the owners to fix the unit.
"A much better method of communication and understanding between the 3 parties, Agent, Owner and Tenant "
"Be able to contact the Property Owner direct. 
At present you have to go through the Property Manager (Real Estate) to be discuss any problems that may arise and to find out the Property Manager do NOT pass on the correct information. "
"Make it easier to transfer your bond between rentals.
As a tenant, I would have loved the option to have a pet or hang a picture on the wall. However, as an owner under 30, I have worked hard to break into the market and feel that my rights need to be balanced with the tenants. Under the current law, owners have discretion to allow pets and pictures to be hung. Owners shouldn't be forced to allow pets as not all pets are well trained, and many cause damage. The same can be said for hanging pictures. I would hate to see a ton of picture hooks in my property from people who can't use the existing ones. "
Property Managers taking photographs of my belongings during inspections. It shouldn’t happen and I feel it’s an invasion of privacy. 
Property owners accountability in regards to maintenance and repairs
More time between notification of entry - open house is 24 hours! 
Purchasing because the current knowledge base of Property Managers in QLD is ridiculous. There is no responsibility on the property manager to ensure the property is maintained during the tenancy. 
Nit picking bond return issues
A requirement for owners to re-decorate every three years
Less inspections if property well maintained 
Landlords who treat renters fairly and fix the houses
"As a renter, have the ability to hang things on walls, without having to check with anyone (within reason)."
"Better communication with property managers to ensure any repairs are easily accessible and to reduce the regularity of inspections which are invasive, especially when a long-term tenant has a good record of looking after the property."
Fair treatment from property managers
Longer lease term.
"The caliber of other renters in the area. There are really nice tenants with families, but unfortunately there are some bad tenants who treat the houses they live in terribly as well as the neighbourhood with no concern for anything or anyone but themselves. "
"Proper long term lease agreements... often get tricked into shorter term.  Landlords can refuse to renew lease which imposes significant moving and letting costs on tenants unless tenants let landlords have their way, accept unfair rent increases and do not insist on their legal rights (eg repairs to ensure safety and quiet enjoyment of tenants home)"
"Tenant-led virtual routine inspections
Pets allowed in all rentals"
to enhance the law for a tenant
"Stronger laws protecting good tenants from bad landlords and agencies. I'd like to see an official, government-supported/funded rating system for landlords and agencies. Bad tenants rightfully go on a register to alert agencies and landlords, so should there absolutely be one for landlords and agencies."
"Have an online register of bad landlords.
"
Easier ways to communicate with real estate/ home owner and RTA for information.
"More rights for tenants. I would’ve liked to have been consulted regarding the oven replacement, and would have financially contributed to the replacement if it gave me some choice. "
"I'd love to see landlords compelled to act on repairs for urgent things like plumbing and electricity and ensuring the property is weatherproof. As a tenant, I'd also like to see it easier for agreements to be reached regarding pets - particularly where the tenant and their pets have superb references with no history of property damage or impairment."
Give landlords more rights.  
Renters need to take ownership and be more respectful of their rental properties
"Unresponsive agents and landlords
Slow repairs
Sending water bills without details of how to pay"
My personal experience has been pretty good so far. 
Being able to make it feel like home. Hangs pictures. Have a shade sail installed. Just things that aren't permanent and can be removed on vacate. 
That it would be easier to find more pet friendly houses up for rent. 
"What the realestate agent must disclose to a prospective tenant prior to any inspection and or lease being signed. Shared utilities, property rules for share accommodation, restrictions on use of shard areas etc. the list goes on and on. "
There are some terrible rental agencies around.
Inspections! I am currently renting privately and have few inspections. But when renting through an agency the inspections were frequent and kind of intrusive. They made me feel like someone was looking for dirt on us. 
Be considered as a human being and not only a weekly income
"Able to see at what point you are up to with your rent, whether behind or how many weeks ahead "
Being allowed to personalise the property such as hanging pictures etc.
Stop landlords from refusing pets in their properties.
House inspections are too frequent. We’ve been here for 5 years without incident and still have quarterly inspections. After 2 years inspections should be Bi annual.
Removal of the need to have 3 monthly inspections - complete invasion of privacy
The way the Property Managers treat the tenants.
Being able to rent any home with pets
More flexible length of lease options.
"Would be nice to not have Real Estate checking on us every 3 months, makes you feel like you doing something wrong."
As a long term renter with the same real estate I feel having so many house inspections in a year is not necessary. After 2 yrs they should trust that the tent can look after the property. Also I feel the feedback from the inspections could focus more on any demage to the property not cleaning issues i.e dusting certain parts of the house. It appears to change from person to person and what one property manager requires changes when the next takes over.
Maintenance requests have been not been dealt with. I'd like these to be completed. 
"Tradesman can use a form 9 without any details of the property manager on the form and leave this in your mail box and only provide 24 hr notice and give you an 8 hour window of when they will attend. This is a huge risk to tenants as they don't know if the tradesman are approved by the landlord/property manager. The tradesman are then provided keys to the property and can attend by themselves within their window of time without telling the tenants what time they will arrive. 
There needs to be a better process so tenants can arrange to be on the property when tradesman will attend. There needs to be mandatory property management notification to tenants of who is approved to attend the property and then if the tradesman is contracting out to another company a separate form 9 should be given by the contractor, not just the initial tradesman. 
Any tradesman can just put a form 9 into a tenants mailbox and attend a property within 24hrs. How are tenants supposed to know who has been approved by the landlord or property manager in that amount of time. Also, tenants have the right to protect their belongings for all inspections/repairs. This time frame does not give them enough time to arrange to be present on the property. 
"
Implementing a system where a rental bond can be rolled over from one tenancy to the next. 
More freedom with things like putting gardens in
allow pet without asking
An independent end of lease inspection - from someone other than the real estate. Or reasonable expectations when you leave the property. 
I have a cat and am looking for a new place . I looked for 6 months and gave up because i could not find a pet friendly rental
Equal time frames around notice- for tenants and owners
long-term leases. Eradication of bonds
"Allowance of pets as the baseline for rental agreements, with the owner having to actively withdraw consent. "
"Improved laws (?), regulations and consistency about property managers."
The feeling that this is not my home. Quartly inspections that seek to point out soap scum on a shower screen and make you feel like a short term hotel.
Landlord obligation standards regarding home maintenance 
I feel like as a renter I have no control or power and am consistently worried that my lease will be ended even though I am a good tenant
"We weren't allowed to have pets. I wanted one small bird in a cage and was told by my landlord that they would evict me straight away if it was seen on site. 

Issues such as repairs never being done on time, unfair rent increases and rental agencies claiming all of the bond."
Better treatment from agents
Longer term rentals allowing increases in price
"'-Less inspections: every 3 months is too frequent, inconvenient (as we always try to have someone off from work to be home for an inspection because we hate the thought of people walking through our house without us there) and is a frequent reminder that this is not our place. 

- pets allowed in rentals

- allowed to paint walls and hang pictures or bolt furniture to walls (for safety purposes)

- easier ability to break leases without huge financial penalty (i.e. without having to continue to pay rent until it’s leased again) in specific circumstances (e.g. death of a family member or relationship breakdown)

- longer lease terms (1-5years)

- no rent increases allowed during a lease"
Landlords claiming damage for incidental wear and tear.
I have had a satisfied experience with renting in Queensland however because I work in the industry of helping others with finding rentals its very limited due to their income as most of the people I support are on New Start Payments and the rental cost on the Sunshine Coast is beyond their ability to rent anything for what they in their income and have to live it hard on the streets or in their cars. Therefore there are two experiences her and I think you can't repair it or make improvements just by plugging up one hole when there are many.   
"More rights for tenants, less rental inspections ( 2 per year not 4 per year). "
"Better enforcement for real estate agencies to communicate issues with both tenants and landlords, and rectify any issues in a timely manner.

In response to question 1.3, I think the rules about renting in Qld are in the property manager's favour, not that of the tenant nor of the property owner."
"Long stay rentals, rents are increasing more than salaries and landlords are reluctant to do maintainence or improve the property "
"The approach/manner of Property Managers. wanting to take photos of inside my oven, my dishwasher. photos of my private furniture etc."
"Property Managers need more training.
Eight managers of our rental in six years. Only two seemed to know what they were doing.
Even after six years they still insisted on quarterly insppections. "
Make it standard to allow pets in all rental properties.
Constant increases to rent on long term renters even though the property value has dropped.
Make Real Estate business and agents more accountable for their actions
Longer lease terms
When I rented the lack of repair to public housing regardless of reports made. 10 yrs with peeling paint and massive cracks. Only repaired 2 weeks before I moved out.
"Stop horrible real estate agents be having like they are God, being over critical and unfair in their expectations just so they can make more money from the rentals (charging the owner of course) "
"More properties with pets allowed, agents who care more about renters, agents who are educated about renters rights and obligations"
More places built to meet demand so rent prices go down and there usn’t 20 people/families fights for one place 
Consistency with water bills 
"Give tenants more choice and control over the place they rent, give tenants more dignity and statibility through legislated safeguards to defend against no fault eviction, end discrimination against those with pets"
Freedom to modify rooms and garden areas. Lock in rates. 
Tenants are duly pre-informed about the style of their neighbours. To late to find out you have absolute morons as neighbours AFTER you move in.
"Cost, better maintenance, pet approvAl, property modificTions, better education on rental rights/obligations. "
Affordability and more pet-friendly rentals
Property Managers that actually care about tenants 
The ability to decorate kids rooms with picture hangings etc 
"Real estates & owners use fear of eviction & threats of blacklisting tenants to do what they want & not fix or improve their rental properties. tenants need to have more rights such as real estates entry to the property, property inspections, allowance of pets & getting thinks fixed or improved at the property."
"More freedoms for tenants, primarily pet ownership"
Longer term lease agreements 
A greater acceptance in the community of people who choose to rent and not own homes.
Frequency of entries/inspections by agents.
The frequency of property inspections is invasive - every 3 months during a long term rental does not align with the implied policy of peaceful habitation.
Stop increasing rent every 6 months. Longer leases up to 5 years
"Allow to hang pictures and tv to walls, and change garden."
More favor for renters with a good rental history.
Improve the advocacy for tenants. There is gross inequality in the relationship between property manager and tenant. To raise a complaint or issue a notice would be a very scary thing for a tenant to embark upon. Rebalance with clearer guidelines that don’t leave rights in the grey area.
longer lease periods
Agents unwillness to give bond back
"The time frame between the Notice to Leave being given and the required to leave is significantly too short. This places a significant burden on tenants to find a suitable and affordable rental they can move into in that time frame. This increases the chance that tenants who may be evicted into homelessness.

Unless there is a significant breach, such as active destruction of the property. Then a minimum of 3 months should be implemented for all other issues."
Property maintenance attended to promptly.
Better communication from real estate agents/landlords
Longer term leases 
More flexibility to do improvements to the house
"More pet friendly accommodation, introducing a standard basic condition requirement e.g requiring carpets and furnishings be updated after x amount of years to avoid 40 year old withered carpet etc"
the price of rental properties
Sometimes the damage or repairs to a property is more than the bond this needs to change.
"If tenants can treat the property as their own, can they dismantle motorbikes on the loungeroom carpet?
"
Pet inclusion with clear guidelines about the requirements of tenants to maintain property in good condition and the landlords recourse should pets damage property 
Allow dogs as a general rule rather than having to plead your case with each new rental agreement
The capacity to enter into a longer term contract to give greater security of tenure and we would sleep better.
Making it easier for renters to own pet. Renters need to be treated fairly: getting the problem fix ASAP not just waiting for the owner to say go ahead with repairs. I’ve had to wait over a year for the owner to agree to fix something in the rental property I live in. 
A better attitude from agents - always feel like a trespasser even though this is my home while I pay rent and have to explain things multiple times to prove something needs fixing.
"continuity of tenancy managers - we have had 9 tenancy managers in 4 years, and very little record keeping between them. makes life very difficult, without our own records, tenancy managers have tried to be untruthful and have been obstructive. "
A stronger emphasis on the rights of tenants rather than the money of owners
Better consulting times between agents and renters. 
I would like to see pets being allowed into homes more generally. I bought a house because I could not find a pet friendly place within my price range and it was cheaper for me to pay back a home loan. I’d also like to see better communication between rental agents and tenants as my requests to improve the living conditions were not acted upon despite living at the property for more than two years.
The ability to own a small pet
Less inspections and the ability to put pictures up
Covered outdoor area
"Allowing pets
Timely repairs"
Consistent noise between apartment complexes 
Better screening re stability of tenants.
Being able to have access to more properties that are pet friendly.
Better understanding of rights and tenants.
Ensure all properties accept pets to rent. 
Faster response times to property problems and to having other tenants people live with me on my lease 
"Pets be allowed, pictures on walls, and real estate not able to ask about your housekeeping skills"
Lack of privacy relating to inspections. Pet ownership should be allowed unless reasonable cause is given.
Fewer rental inspections if you are a good tenant
Less restrictions on pets and rentals.
"Discourage landlords and agents from making us sign a new lease at the end of a fixed term lease.  In NSW it only happens when the tenant wants it, otherwise the tenant is on a monthly tenancy with 3 months notice for vacating premises.
"
"Better reliability of real estate agents. I've had times where I've arranged to go and view a potential property to rent, only to have the agent not show up and not call to let me know, and after I'd arrange to have time off work to view a property have the agent call me minutes before the allocated time to say that the property had been rented out. Some agents have terrible organisation skills."
"Being able to have pets, we have an excellent rental history but so many people wouldnt even consider us because we had two dogs "
Making it easier for renters to have pets while on a lease
Easier to change shared tenancies eg when my housemate moved out at the end of the fixed lease but can’t be easily removed / changed into just my name for the next term. They were stuck on the lease for months as there weren’t clear forms/process.
Allow pets. I'm a middle aged man that suffers from anxiety and depression. I'd dearly love to have a pet to come home to and have something to love.
Make tennants liable for the cost of the damage that they do.
"Increased ability to have pets, ability to make decorative changes to house e.g. painting walls, hanging pictures with return to pre-rental state upon departure, and increased flexibility with subleasing. "
"I have 2 indoor cats and,am having trouble moving to brisbane to be closer to family as  so far sorry no pets allowed."
Pets being allowed in rentals
Better property managers who treat tenants with respect 
Tenants have very little power or rights
Registered Real Estate agents need to provide proper service. They treat renters like second class citizens. Some of them do not know the legislation and try to get away with things that are not quite correct. 
"'- Maintenance issues attended to promptly and/or the right of the tenant to organise maintenance in cases whereby tenants are not able to contact the property manager.
- Pets allowed (particularly outside dogs and inside cats) where there is sufficient space for the animal and the tenant ensures they keep the property tidy and clean.
- Carpets need not be professionally cleaned upon exit at the expense of the tenant, unless marks are left or the carpet is clearly dirty. This matter should be addressed on a 'case by case' basis.
- All photos taken of the property upon providing notice and vacating the premises entirely prior to end of lease, should be taken into account prior to real estate assessment. Particularly backyards, front yards and grass. This can grow quickly following tenant vacation due to weather conditions and then gardening costs may/are taken out of the bond inappropriately at no fault of the tenants own."
Responsible and honest property owners
Landlords being held accountable for maintenance and not renewing leases because a tenant asks for repairs. 
"Pet Bonds. There are a lot of people who are not responsible pet owners and many that are. A pet bond would provide a safety net for lessors and for landlords, to cover damages that pets may make to property."
"Whilst this hasn't happened to me personally I know people who have been affected. Where an owner decides through the course of a rental agreement to list their property for sale I feel they should be responsible for reasonable costs of relocation such as removalist and connection fees for services at the new premises if it is agreed that the tenant has to move.
Another issue would be to limit rent increases to CPI"
More security for tenants when landlords decide to sell
When we apply for a lease the longest term allowed is 12 months.  We are long term tenants in our 70's and will be renting indefinitely.  We have been here for 4 years and wish to continue our stay but have to keep renewing the lease every 12 months.  We need security of a longer lease like they have overseas.
When renting through Queensland government housing the government (landlords) should have the same rules applied to them as all owners.
More rights as a tenant. To make sure your not homeless. Not given 2 months to move out if you have a lease.  And to be able to have a pet. 
"Queensland building regulations mean properties need bars on the windows, however this creates an extreme danger in the event of a fire. These regulations need changing to force landlords to ensure fire safety for tenants."
"The quality of housing and the cost! The property I currently reside in an abdolute dump. I’m fairly sure this property would violate multiple building and electricity codes on its own, and secondarily the standard of living compared to what the landlord is charging is absolute bullshit. "
"The real estate agents have all the power; there is nothing you can do as a tenant if a real estate agent has decided they want something a certain way.  I have had real estate agents force us to pay more rent, force us to pay for repairs that previous tenants caused, forced us to pay for removal of goods that were the owners! And they know they can get away with it because tenants are too scared to have their rental record tarnished by loss of bond, or poor references.  While there are avenues to go down - e.g. the RTA the process is time consuming and often leads no where.  Sometimes I also think the owners have no idea how bad their agents are. I have left rental properties purely because the agents were so bad."
"Being able to have pets
Easier to have leases longer than 12 months"
Being allowed to place nailable hooks without permission 
My Property Manager said I cannot remove a peice of wood hanging from our letter box which is attached to the front fence with sharp rusty wire entangled around the wood. I can see the rusty wire is holding up the fence. It is also very unsightly and a safety issue. She dosnt want it removed I am very upset about this. I think the stupid Property Manager should get the owners to fix the fence or replace it.
Having to have 4 weeks bond in advance 
"I need a pet!  I am a widow, nearly seventy.  I have no family here.  I am diagnosed with PTSD and suffer depression and panic attacks.  I own my furniture so my pet would not damage anything.  The floors are tiled."
Ensure that real estate I sections remain objective and unbiased. 
"Make the process more open.
RTA needs to be neutral not have the owner interest at heart.  
"
Quicker attention for minor repairs.
Having not to compete with so many people wanting one house
Pet bonds to be allowed
Make Real Estate Agents more accountable for their actions and treatment of tenants. Feels like a landlords / agents market where they can do what they want and tenants have to put up with it.
I think the definition around normal wear and tear should be more clearly defined so that property owners can recoup costs for repairs that a normal person would consider is not normal wear and tear.
Difficulty finding a home to rent that allows pets
"I would change the whole model, a cultural shift is needed so the community at large and by association owners and the real estate industry acknowledges the critical importance of renting. Long-term (5 year +) rental leases should be an option. Tenants needs to also have their rights protected, at the moment the model is unfairly stacked to favour the owner in all circumstances. "
Security of affordable term leases.
"More communication, more time to prepare for moving out (more time to find a new rental property), pets allowed in all rentals."
Specifying when bills that are managed by property manager/landlord are going to be distributed.
Property updated regularly ie painting Maintance of building 
That I wouldnt have to pay 38% of my wage on rent
Repairs carried out as requested.  
Real response and action from real estate agent
"Less invasive inspections. I feel like I'm being treated as lower class because I'm renting. If everything is clean and there's no damage, no problem. "
"Mandatory long-term rentals, of at least 12 months minimum or more each time. Six months is too short for stability reasons, especially when you have kids. If the tenant is bad in that time, they can obviously still get their lease cancelled and evicted, so why not?"
"More tenants rights
Allowances for not contacting rental agents during medical situations"
"Availability to treat the house like it is my home and at the end of the lease return the house to the owner as it was when we moved in, ie Hang photos, have pets."
"The pricing of rentals, rent is becoming unaffordable especially for family homes, add the cost of living ie the overly priced food bill, heavily taxed petrol, car maintenance, regular medication without a health care card , daycare/schooling needs etc.  Then add the bills such as the world's priciest electricity, water, phone bills, overpriced slow internet etc. Then take into consideration if you have loans etc.  It is becoming unaffordable to support a family.  Cheap rent now for a family home takes about half of a minimum wage income per week in a ""bad, high crime"" area, this is a real issue.  I think the rent needs to be capped more then $100 a bedroom for example, at the moment its unaffordable and people are really struggling to survive. 

Ceiling fans throughout should also be a minimum requirement in queensland aswell as security screens should be essentials in high crime rate areas.  I find nearly every rental property is lacking these features."
More pet friendly rentals
What the land lords commitments need to be in regards to fixing issues as soon as possible not after 12 months
"Less inspections when been long term tenant and owners/agents being more reasonable if tenant suffers hard times financially as its surely better to work with tenant about money than boot them out asap and have advertising expenses an other costs to get another tenant. Pets should be accepted always on condition premises left as found when first occupied, children do more damage than most pets do. "
Prices are far too expensive for what you actually get.
  Ever 4 month house inspection 
Have everything in the house working as it should
"Pets Approved if property is suitable, with a provision that tenants must have the property professionally sprayed for fleas at the end of a tenancy. 
Provision for pool chemicals to be charged to tenants with servicing to be paid by owners. 
Professional carpet cleaning to be done at the end of a tenancy. "
Stricter standard for landlords to fix problems
Regulations about the safety of housing.
Realestate agents taking the needs of disabled persons into account.
Access to property without tenants being present - especially when you have pets that become distressed or tenants are away on holidays.
"Complete acceptance of tenants being permitted pets, and ability to decorate walls with basic items such as photos"
"I have a beef with one particular agency franchise which seems to be attempting to place tenants not just at arms length, but beyond the end of the fingertips.  As an older person I feel the need to talk with those in charge of property management, rather than being forced to use mobile phone apps.  In fact being on prepaid means that I don't want to use internet on my phone.  It is a phone, after all.  I think this problem is related to the agencies expecting too much of their property managers:  that is they are supervising far too many properties to be able to get to know their clients properly.

The same agency, (and quite a few others I found subsequently when asking around during inspections for renting a property so I could get away from the agent in question) had no actual free method of paying the rent.  Alternatives included:  IPayRent, bank cheque or money order.  My big concern with this activity is that such details were never included in the advertising for the properties. 

Another aspect that I found really dissatisfying was that 3 months from the end of the rental contract I received an email with an implied threat in it, that if I didn't sign the new lease contract within a month then I would be likely to be subjected to a termination notice which was to be sent out 2 months before the end of the contract.  This activity virtually entraps tenants in properties because it become too expensive to make a move without penalty:  either early and hence a double rent payment for 4 to 6 weeks, or break lease, making it impossible to get another rental because a black mark would be recorded against my name.  

I moved to a new place, and the landlord there advised the agent (who was actually quite helpful, and did have a free payment method) that he was going to sell... about 3 weeks after I signed on.  So when a suitable place came on the market I moved again.  This time I am in a property that the owner obviously doesn't want to repair:  ceiling paint peeling, dangerously broken tile in the laundry which is also the back entrance, gutters full of leaves (potential fire hazard as the property is only a few hundred metres from Nerang State Forest, and bushfires can spot fire up to kms in front of the main fire front.  I so like the place though and the price is in relation to the state of repairs.  I can put up with things if the price is right!
"
Allowed to have multiple pets and hang photos on the wall.
"I would like smoking on outdoor balconies to be banned...the balcony abutts mine and my lounge and kitchen smell of smoke. Also I do not use my own balcony due to the smoke and smell, as my male neighbour spends all days AND SLEEPS THERE so that he can smoke 24/7. This is a Qld Housing block of units for seniors."
More regulations around share house arrangements rather than treating every lease agreement the same 
"Ensuring young, inexperienced property managers actually know the legislation they are working with. "
"More respect from real estate staff, I have been stood up, passed over, gazzumped on one occasion they are inflexible with their viewings and rental conditions. The bonds are huge and up front payment is rigid and exclusive"
Landlords and real estate agents not refunding bond loans 
Change to bond practices: Landlords should have to have a maintenance bond in place as well as an increase to the tenants bond if they have pets
"Allow pets in all rental properties 
"
"There would be more security and dignity afforded the tenant. As it is, we are treated as simply a method to pay off the mortgage of a housing investor. We have no security other than lease by lease, and the rent is put up every chance they get. It's an utterly horrible experience."
"Tenants being responsible for the cost of repairing damage caused by them, their guests or their pets."
"Make it so that if any arbitration is required and one of the parties does not attend/call that the party who does not call in looses the arbitration.

Last time I was in arbitration, I called in and the owner didn't but the owner still won even without calling in."
To make minor repairs without needing agency permission
"For the owner to have to give tenant 3 months notice of a new lease so that everyone has the best information available (will it be renewed, new rent cost, etc), and the ability to make considered decisions without feeling like we have to accept whatever we're given. This would reduce the adversarial feeling about renting."
The Real Estate agents need to be accountable for putting bad tenants in your house and not getting tradesmen to do repairs on time for my tenant. 
Allow pets in rentals
"Longer leaves.
Not have my rent increase every year. 
Difficultyhaving pets"
"After renting in a high cost suburb,  in same tenancy for over 11 years, they turned very nasty when I broke the lease and trumped up over 7k of ""costs"". The communication. Was deceptive and disgraceful from the on site manager.  They tried several times to add extra costs. The made illegal demands and I had to get advice from rental tenancy authority to tell the on site manager it was illegal.  How is that just? "
"As a landlord, I would look for a better property manager who actually bothers to respect their tenants."
This is my first time renting there a few things that need fixing the unit is 10 years old and needs refreshing if they want it to stay nice 
Set penitlise for landlords and realestate agents whom don’t repair or ignore repair requests of kick tenents out for asking for repairs 
More freedom to treat it as a home and more affordable prices.
Consistency in expectations for rental inspections 
Greater number of properties available 
More specific guides for “wear and tear use” 
Make it easier to get out of a lease with a fixed termination fee
Cost of living vs pay is way too high. Doesn’t suit normal lifestyle if you have pets or kids you often miss out on rental options or have to pay way more than means (eg; large house/townhouse). 
"Wear and Tear rating based on Quality of Products. Eg. Poor / cheap quality tapware does not have the same life expectancy and wear ratings of higher / expensive quality tapware. 

Therefore it is not the fault of tenant's if such poor quality products wear quicker and or breakage outside of warranty periods (under normal conditions). 

Some examples: Tapware, Light Bulbs, Fly Screens, Laminated Surfaces (kitchen cupboards)."
Prompt and adequate repairs without having to issue notices to remedy breach to get fundamentals likes blinds and basic inclusions fixed.
Allow pets and ban smoking on balconies and in courtyards
"Make changes to allow tenants make the house their home e.g. allowing pets, gardens, picture hooks etc. 
Improve security for tenants regarding the end of lease: remove no-grounds evictions, much more control regarding end of lease due to sale of house, renovations, or owner moving in. (for example, recognising that moving costs $2000+, and that this unexpected cost can be a very big financial burden. Plus the stress and time of moving.)
Reduce allowable number of inspections for privacy of tenants (every 3 months is excessive, when there have never been any concerns raised)"
"Numerous instance (seen and experienced) when switching from one real estate to another, of one week's rent being lost in translation, and the tenant being expected to provide all the evidence to resolve this issue. REAL ESTATE AGENTS TREAT RENTERS LIKE SCUM, which is not surprising really,  seeing as the only incentive they have to make money is to keep the owner happy, not the renters. Renters feel as though they cannot come to the real estate with requests or complaints for fear that the lease will not be renewed if they cause too much of a fuss. MOVING IS EXPENSIVE, RENT IS TOO EXPENSIVE in Brisbane FOR WHAT YOU GET. Six month leases are very beneficial to the owners, but very scary for the renters if they can't afford to move every six months if you have enough bad luck (which we have) where the owners want to sell the property, or move back in etc. WANT A DOG TO TREAT MY MENTAL HEALTH but too scared that it will be to hard to find a new rental (if we have to move in future) with a dog and a cat, almost impossible. TOO  MANY COMPANIES BUILDING AWFUL CRAMPED UNITS and charging ridiculous prices because they are 'new', but no one WANTS to live in those things."
More clearly defined circumstances in which rental bond can be deducted from. Too many agents try to take bond money for fair wear and tear (from younger renters in particular).
Property Managers taking photo at inspections 
"Pets allowed in rentals - we have been denied over 20 properties in the last year because we own a dog. Many of our friends simply lie about not owning a pet and hide the pet during rental inspections, which isn't fair to the landlord who is being lied to, or the tenant who lives in fear of being evicted over a member of their family being unsigned to the lease because they are an animal. "
Longer leases in addition to 12 month periods 
"Three monthly inspections. Real estate agent reports are always in our favour giving us a triple A pass. In that case, why can't we go to 6 monthly inspections "
"For the government to offer incentives, and also to standardise contracts, around energy efficiency in rental properties (eg solar panels, insulation, water tanks etc).  "
"I am no longer renting, however own a property managed by a real estate agent.  We have a pets allowed policy, however have caught the real estate a few times doing a no pets allowed lease.  I think that they have this as their standard lease and it’s unfair on the tenants.
I also tried to get the real estate to organise with the smoke detector people to install detectors as is the new policy.... they kept fobbing me off and I had to organise through a different electrician."
"Ability to have pets and put artwork up to make it my own. 
Landlords actually abiding by the law and not letting themselves into the property without notification. "
"The property managers have always been difficult to deal with, particularly in times where there have been emergency/urgent situations that required timely responses. "
Pets easier to approve in rental properties 
"Longer leases and therefore more security of term and rental amount.
Ability to make basic changes to a house such as pictured on walls.
Often the property is expected to be in better condition at the end of the lease than it was upon entry, regardless of what the entry condition report states.
Agents should not be allowed to take photos during routine inspections of the property.
Basic repairs or safety risks can take a long time to get fixed with no input from tenant."
Making it easier to have pets 
"Allow me to be an independent adult. Rental inspections are a violation of my life, my privacy, my confidence. I am an adult. I know how to clean a house. I don't need another person to come check on me every few months. This is one of the most ridiculous thing I have come across since moving to Australia. 
We are at the mercy of the owners random decisions. If they feel like starting some works on the house next week, they will. Whether it suits us or not doesn't come in the picture.
I am extremely worried about my bond. Even though my inspections have always been perfect, I have heard that rental companies are very strict and it is very difficult to get your bond back. "
Government regulation of housing standards and law enforcement 
Depending on real estate agents I would ensure that there would be no favouritism and that all parties are treated fairly.
Too many horr9r stories from landlords
More options for renters to save so they can obtain there own property in the near future
Rentals need to do more about horrible neighbours. 
"Allowing pets to those who have a good inspection history. 
Better and quicker access to remove “tenants” from hell - like my former neighbors- it took 8 months and they left the landlords house a mess. 
An across the board cap on management fees that property managers can charge - I believe these contribute to rising rent costs. "
"I feel the Bond should go back to being transferred from one home to another as thousands of low income earners cannot save the bond againt if they HAVE to move out of the blue because the home they are renting is sold by the landlord,  people would and do become homeless as unable to save the $1000.00 + to move to another location or home, or they have to store their belongings and live with family till they can do so. So many who are well off this dose not effect but for many it’s impossible as wages do not go up like the cost of rent and it is way too inflated in the past 15 years. That’s why so many cannot afford to buy a home in their lifetime as not everyone can find a high paying job to sustain the high payments or high rent in some areas, so I think this should be changed as it effects people lives in so many ways."
"Tenants live in these places and they deserve to feel at home. Tenants should have the right to own pets - this is so important. Young people 
and low income earners often can't afford to own a home, so they rent. Owning a pet shouldn't be a privilege only afforded to the wealthy. Pets should be allowed in rental properties, with tenants responsibile for repairs if there is damage caused (but a good tenant with a pet will keep the place in good condition. A bad tenant will trash the place all by themself). Additionally, tenants should be able to modify the home within reason - no major repairs without permission - but hanging up pictures and easy to reverse changes that will make the place they live every day feel like home. Because tenants often don't have much money, we're really neglected in this way; but we deserve for our homes to feel like a home as much as wealthier home owners do.

An extra note; there should be greater incentive (e.g. fines) for property owner's to do repairs and keep their property in a good condition. I've had terrible experiences with real estate agents and owners that are neglectful without consequence."
"Allowing renters more power - we are at the mercy of landlords and managing agents, many who are power hungry and unfair on tenants. People with long term excellent renting records should be rewarded with trust."
Access to affordable housing 
Easier access to pet friendly acc
"Making it more our home with personal touches.  Photo, pictures on walls.  I am Lucky where I am now as landlord allows it on condition if there is damage I fix it but most rentals don’t have this available "
"Rent going up in vast amounts, plus 3 month inspections should be made to the life of the lease, example, not every3 months"
Online portal to log maintenance requests with my real estate
To be able to treat our rental house like our home.  To not have to have inspections every 3 months.  To be able to have a small pet.
To be free of the fear of being kicked out 
"Agents are most of the time condescending, using power over tenants by threatening to keep bond. Only saw improvement when they became desperate to find tenants"
Routine inspections are too intrusive. Our real estate take at least 20 mins to walk thru the house with their clipboard. 
"Less inspections
Longer timeframes for giving notice for (non-urgent) issues
Abolish ""no pets"" clause
Basic yard maintenance to be landlords responsibility"
I would be able to have pets. 
Property owners have all the rights. Previously rented and because we did not to Inrease our rent we had to leave. Then they advertise the house for the same rent we were paying. The real estate only cares about the getting more money to the owner not the tenants. It's about how much rent they can get from you. 
Having pets allowed by Government law like in Victoria 
Being able to have my dog inside with me
More accountability of Rentsl Managers and Agencies
"I would make it law that once a form 11 is submitted  then Age n or owner must comply with the issue on form 11 within the time or go to Q-cat and have the tenant have to submit a 2nd  form 11 
If issue still not resolved then owner can not just issue tenant with a vacate form n must wait untill lease is finished "
Claims on Rental Bonds need to be more in favour of the renter rather than the real estate.
"Comparable rent prices for location and condition of the home
"
Tenants should be held liable for damage caused to property that is more than rental bond. Tenants do not own the home and is abhorent that the government is considering telling me that pets must be allowed. I don’t allow dog/cats right of passage in my home! Yet I have spent the last 6 months repairing the damage that has been caused by feral tenants and their unapproved cat!
Hanging photos. Allowed to have my dogs. 
"A body that you could actually take complaints about real estate/owners to, that has the power to overturn their decisions regarding maintenance issues, bond return etc."
Make the system easier for people who have pets
Why do GOOD Tenants have to be checked up on every 3 months???  
Contacting the owner of the property. Had issues with the property and took the owner 6 months to provide an answer. 
"Real estate agents/Property Managers to be held accountable for their behaviour towards tenants
Essential repairs completed within 7-14 days"
"Being able to have a dog, hang artwork, better communication with property managers "
Less inspections than once per 3 months
"Theres not one thing. The whole system needs to be overhauled. Totally feel like second class citizens as renters. No security, houses constantly going on and off the market. regular incremental increase of rent, no rights, far too regular inspections. Option of 2 to 5 year leases, no more than yearly inspections, capped rent increases. That's probably a good start."
Being able to hang my paintings
"Cheaper rents, being able to have pets and not being discriminated against for having a pet. landlords not putting the rent up at end of lease, then when you decide to leave, the advertised rent is cheaper. Being able to have photos on walls."
Being allowed to put pictures on the walls
"Property agents do not respond to requests and when they do, they reject everything "
Enforceable rules to ensure tenants keep property clean & tidy & responsible for any damage they cause.
"I would like to be able to make my apartment feel more like a home. I would like to be able to put picture hooks in the walls to hang artwork, or place a mirror on the inside of a cupboard door without seeking permission from my landlord."
"Less restrictions on Pets, less intrusive inspections, better house upkeep.  More restriction on rental increases."
"Help with cost of maintaining gardens. Eg: when top soil to grounds is really needed. 
Pay half each "
"Australia is a very expensive country, expensive property. Limited availability and landlords seem to want to much for the what the property is worth. "
Inspections not needing to be as clean as a bond clean and to increase the time period to four to six months and not quarterly. Pets are allowed inside
"Having the rent increased after 6 months and having to move ! 
Not being able to put a picture or photo of my kids on the wall 
Having visitors and the house doesn’t look like my home 
Being charged outrageous  cleaning fees when the house has been left cleaner than when I moved in "
Landlord has ability to claim for costs where tenant clearly not met lease obligations.
"Being allowed to hang a picture, paint a room, do minor repairs or improvements without having to ask permission.
Being able to own a pet without feeling like your an unwanted alien.  Having a pet bond as the US does would be fine.
Mainly being able to feel like the home you're paying a considerable sum per week for, often as much as a mortgage ... can feel like your home ... not like you're in a prison accounting for every tiny thing.
And inspections every 3 months????   Ridiculous!!  And they expect the same type of clean as if you were moving out ... skirting boards, power points, fans, all windows, my house is always clean and tidy, but the pressure it puts on you is like a finals exam, 4 times a year!
If you prove yourself to be a good tenant within 12 months ... inspections should be eased back to twice a year or less.
"
If landlord would be willing to spend some money to refurbish the interior of the house. Been renting same house for 18 years. 
Better management of properties
Increased rights for pet owners
"Property Managers issuing Notices to Leave without grounds as retaliation for dispute referral to the RTA  Proof on Tenant to substantiate at QCAT
Property Managers able to pass bad references amongst each other without any Tenant recourse
Property Managers behaviour not accountable"
Constant promises of work to be done and 18months later still waiting. 
"Efficiency and speed of redress procedures against dodgy real estate agents. A personal inspection by an RTA representative within 24 hours of a complaint, so as they can see the problem first hand and engage with the respective agent or landlord immediately."
"On vacate the real estate must obtain a number of quotes for repairs.
The real estate must allow for wear and tear, especially on older houses. 10 years and older."
Allow 14 days to complete condition report upon signing lease agreement. Three days is not enough time.
"Pet owners should not be discriminated against. It is very dificult to find accommodation when you have a pet (especially a dog). A huge proportion of people keep pets and should be allowed to do do as they provide company, encourage exercise and improve mental health. Renters should be respected and appreciated and not mistrusted and chaperoned. In other words, I should not feel privliged that somebody has allowed me to rent their property when I own a pet - this should be a right. "
"The way you are treated by agents, even if you are an excellent tenant you are often treated like a second rate citizen. "
Allowing people to have pets. Especially when they have been proven to be well behaved.
Allow pets in more places.
understanding wheelchairs cause unintended damage
"Better real estate agents. I’ve been renting for 9 years now and have not have 1 understanding helpful real estate agent. They really are just in it for the money.
Also being able to have pets in the household. "
"My rental experiences have been good on the whole, but I'd like to see more done about illegal tenancies. The last house I rented was sold to an overseas buyer who (according to the real estate agent) invited us to continue renting without a contract, even though they didn't have permission to lease a property in Australia. We decided to move out rather than surrender the protection of a contract. "
"There should be some of penalty if tenants abandon a property before the expiring of the term or without giving notice, leaving with unpaid rent and the property damaged and not cleaned with significant costs for the owner not covered by the bond."
How you are treated as a Tennant. You are so stressed by so many aspects of renting can feel like your only on safe ground with certain leases and for length of lease. Needing pet friendly severely reduces options put you at risk of accepting a lease you dont want out of desperation. Landlords seem to hold the power. 
The exit process a lot of real estates go over the top with the exit clean. I have been pulled up in the past because a bug fell in the toilet in between the time the clean was completed and they inspected. Also there should be a rule that pets are allowed at every property and the tenant just pays and extra “pet bond”. 
"Having more control. Being able to put a picture up, get maintenance done, get repairs completed quickly, being able to find a property that accepts a dog. "
Would ideally love to be able to get a dog for my children.
Constant inpections and not able to have pets.
"Shift the balance of power. Any breach by the renter and you're out. The owners constantly breach tenancy agreements yet there is no impact on them.
If they don't maintain the premises to a liveable standard, that's just too bad for the renter.
If they turn up at the premises unannounced and let themselves in, that's just too bad for the renter.

If a renter doesn't notice a mark on the wall present when they moved in and put it on the condition report, then that's all their bond gone."
Allowance of pets in more homes. 
"Allowing dogs in all free standing homes, and cats in all homes."
To be able to have our small pets inside 
Lower rents. Less people looking as limited rentals bring price up. Supply n demand
"Less house inspections, and to have repairs done after asking the first time. "
"The ability to negotiate rent if and when solar panels can be installed. I think the government should really push for all rental properties to have a mandatory solar installation along with water tanks to assist with energy costs and environment. There is no incentive at all for investors to install solar. If renters had cheaper electricity, there would be more surplus cash to spend on other retail items, and invest money back into local community."
"No 3 monthly invasive inspections! 6 monthly would suffice.
Allow pets! 
Allow changes to gardens by tenants if they want! 
Allow things to be hung on the walls etc!
Follow the VIC gov law changes please!!!"
Insist terms and conditions of the lease are adhered to.
Allow tenants some say in body corporate decisions.
Allow pets as the rule not the exception.
"More private parking needs to be included (ie. 1 per bedroom)...Pets and children should be under the same restrictions where leases are involved (ie. if pets are not allowed because or potential noise & damage then children should logically also be banned)...Landlords should be legally obliged to fix safety complains within a certain amount of time, and no one (including the landlord) should be allowed to enter the premises without written consent from all residents for each occasion...If the place is put up for sale, minimum of 6 months notice from landlord is required, and they should not be allowed to show perspective buyers through the place until the renters have permanently left. "
Being able to put pictures up. And have a pet
"Restriction on pets in properties, we've seen kids do more damage than our dog has ever done in 10 years.

Also... why can't we have longer lease periods, we'd rather just sign a 5 year lease or 10 year lease and be done with it. The constant resigning every 12 months is a real pain."
"More livability, hnging paintings, pets, issues listened to and fixed quickly. "
Make it easier to have pets in rental properties
"Improve the ambiguity between entry/exit condition reports and what counts as ""fair wear and tear"""
"Faster and more efficient responses from realestates/owners in regards to maintenance, both critical and non critical. Laws to ensure all maintenance is undertaken and in a timely manner. "
"Agents disempowerment renters.  They treat renters as second class citizens.  You have no right S.  They don't fix things,  if you breach the real estate you will be asked to leave.  You can't put in hooks etc to make the house Your Own feel.  You can't have animals.  "
More rights for tenants eg entry so often meaning I have to take time off work
More properties allowing pets
Pets being allowed by default.
"Real estates following up on maintenance. Such as shoddy gas connections. Or having to replace old stoves that only have one working burner. 

Being allowed to install shelving and safety mechanisms for furniture. "
"Stronger penalties for bad landlords.
Tenants who ruin properties should be made to pay all expenses. Criminal prosecution. "
having landlords to be required to give 6 months notice where they intend to sell or not renew the lease as long as your are a good tenent
"As a home owner, with tenants, tenants have FAR too many rights, far more than the home owner. I am appalled that tenants are to get MORE rights. "
"1.allowed to have pets..
2.house inspections every 3 mths, I find this an invasion of privacy.
3. can't hang pictures up.
4.Rental never feels like home... it's the house I rent...

the requirement to provide housing in good condition for the rental price.
Minimum standard of rental property 
Limits to how much rent can be increased in a single 12 month period. 
Body corporate rules
"Allowing pets in rental properties, without massively increasing the price of rent."
Improve communication with owner to speed up process on repairs
"Real estate agent monopoly and abuse of personal information. We are forced to hand over sensitive and private information to real estate agents, and if we do not we no chance of being considered for the property of interest. They must be forced to remove all personal information following a lease."
Property Managers knowing their jobs
Property Managers who actually get issues in rentals fixed for tenants
"Frequency of inspections is far too high, and our real estate is constantly trying to find excuses to inspect outside of the three month minimum - even threatening us with false maintenance requests so they can 'enter with almost no notice'. "
Making it easier to be able to rent with a dog 
"House inspection, even though they are done every 3 months, I think that if you have been in the home for more then 2 yrs they could be done every 6 months provided  that the property has been looked after and no damage has been done, also some realestate agents are going over the homes with a fine tooth comb and they shouldn't be aloud, it causes alot of stress for some renters especially if you have small children you feel the home should look emaculate and not lived in."
Bond refunds procedure
more pet friendly options - I could have cheaper rent (& therefore save some money from my pay for my approaching old age) if I hadn't had to accept a dearer rental property that would allow pets.  That money going into my superannuation instead of the Landlord's bank account could make my old age more financially secure.
"Repairs addressed in a timely fashion , allow pets "
If laws are to change allowing pets then some guarantees would be good. We intend on living in our current rental property in the future and would want tenants to ensure that dogs were vaccinated against Pavo virus for example as land with Pavo should not have other dogs for another 5 years. We’d hate for one tenant’s carelessness to mean that we or other tenants couldn’t have a dog. 
"That tenants have to pay a pet bond for damage caused as they can cause damage to doors, carpets and curtains plus the fleas. Not like the tenants half the time care as they have the view that landlords can afford the damage that they cause."
Rental prices need to be drastically reduced to accommodate single parent families.
To be considered just as important as home owners with regards to property issues/maintenance and not rated as less significant and therefore not as urgent by real estate agents when seeking assistance 
"It is very difficult to find pet friendly rentals. Most of the times I find is not the owners not allowing pets, it's because property managers do not want the hassle. 

Also renters should be allowed to change the locks at their own cost and change it back to original when vacate. This will ensure no unauthorised entry by property agents."
"More privacy, not so many inspection, being able to hang pictures on the wall, "
"I am really concerned about the egregious privacy violations by real estate agents and businesses like TICA. Real estate agents give renters personal information away to the TICA database which then onsells it to third parties without the renters consent. They even do it to people who make an application and dont get to occupy the house they applied for.
This is illegal according to state, federal and international privacy legislation. TICA not only sells your personal information but they also hold it for over the required time. They do not delete your personal information when they are required to by law.
There is no valid reason for TICA to hold your information or for the real estate agents to give it to them when all they need is your name and date of birth to find out if you have a black mark against your name with regard to previous tenancies."
Flexibility with pets and being able to hang pictures 
"pet should be considered in every home or apartment to be rented. Pet improves mental health of every person. Pet helps person to be less depress therefore person can be productive in the society. Pets have positive impact to individual, to families... pets are families. They should be not refused in the rental property."
Being able to get longer than 12 month leases 
Tenants must use allocated garages for vehicles not storage. 
Requirements on landlords to work within the law and the timeframe in which they have to respond to tenants. I would also like the rta to have more power to resolve breaches.
Better communication from real estate. Real estates should be obliged to inform you of major developments/ construction in the immediate area.
More privacy from next door neighbours.
Be able to have kept our pets.
Make the owners more accountable for property repairs 
If a property is up for rent the entirety of the property should be available.  It should be illegal for the landlord to have areas as their personal storage or sections of the garden fenced off with junk in it.
More access to long term rentals ie. investor owned rather than owners who might decide to move in in the near future.
"Allow for responsible pet ownership, similar to the change in legislation in Victoria. As a tenant, I offered to pay additional bond and for any damages a potential pet would incur, but was still denied the opportunity to have a pet. "
"Less inspections,  not as strict on Silly things like minor removals marks or easily fixable things"
To lift some restrictions so you can make it your home. Limit invasion with the number of photos that are taken every 4 month inspection. Your personal belongings should be that not to the real estate or owner.
"Better, more consistent communication between property managers and their lessors/tenants. "
Increase bond to cover unpaid rent and repairs at end of lease.
Lack of appropriate affordable rental housing for people only on pension incomes (and with disability or impairments); also not being able to have pets in the vast bulk of rental properties available to people on low incomes
More places allowing pets including indoor / outdoor pets
Equal notice period of 4 weeks for vacating for either owner or tenant
Longer leases with fixed rent. 
Not being able to get things done by both real estates and body corporates
Outrageously invasive inspections.
Incompetent real estate agents. High rents compared to wages. 
Criminal charges for tenants who damage property and then take off. Repeat offenders should also face harsher penalties.
"Not allowing owners to use their own contractors, and only being allowed to use real estates contractor."
"I would like to see that when house inspection take place that the real estate person is not aloud to enter your rental property without you been present unless you have given written consent..
In the world we live now police check or not these people should not be allowed in our homes we pay to live on there own we have rights to privacy to..
The reality we rent through in Ipswich have a massive turnover of staff and this is always a massive concern to me..
Also the people doing inspection should not be aloud to take photos in our home write reports of and issues that need fixing etc not take photos again our privacy.."
"Property owners have less legal rights over their own property than tenants , ensure owners are not financially disadvantaged by the residents , non payment of rent and refusing to leave, with the owner having to get a court order to get them out.  "
Real estate agents behavior is totally hit and miss; some are great some are terrible. Is there a way of ensuring adequate registration or even rating them so landlords and tenants can make informed choices?
Mandatory ceiling fans at a minimum.  
The inspections need to be less frequent if you have a good rental history. 
"I’d love more leniency with regards to “wear and tear”. Obviously there’s issue with this, like blatantly creating damage. But for actual accidents I feel like there should be more wiggle room for scratches or small dents in the wall."
Universal allowance of pets. 
More affordable housing.  Allowing pets. 
"Fans in every bedroom. 
"
Cost and ridiculous standards
Experience and professionalism of property managers. 
The real estates exit reports that exceed the requirements for exiting the property.
Having my pets that I had to give away because of lack of pet friendly rentals 
Being able to have things repaired quicker. Being able to personalise the property by hanging photos on walls. 
"Being able to make minor changes to home, such as picture hooks"
Tenants need to ask before they make additions or change fixtures.
Peoples' greater respect for the notion of private property.
If we were allowed to have a pet and put pictures up on the wall.
"being able to treat the house like a home - including longer leases. Then with a longer lease perhaps the ability to make minor alterations without having to get permission, like putting in a small garden shed, garden beds, painting a child's room etc. "
Frequency of inspections. They are too often and too picky. 
"Landlords provide quality accommodation, tenants respect the landlords and property managers."
"Real estate agents can let the power go to their heads, they need to be vetted better.  Nobody should be refused accommodation because an agent can't remain professional.  Record keeping should be a must, perhaps we need a register for all renters that shows when people have been good tenants, that records entry/exit information so renters can't be stung for previous tenants leaving the house in disrepair or unclean and simply records rental history, so when your agents sell the agency or the rights to the property the record remains for the tenants"
"More freedom for having a pet, 6 or 12 monthly inspections instead of 3 monthly. More freedom of creating the house your home! "
The increase in rent each year. Long term tenants should be rewarded. I have bren in my rental property for 10 yrs and my rent has gone up more than my income has.
Hold Real Estates more responsible for their failings
"The option to have pets at any property, I'd be happy to pay 8 weeks bond rather than 4. "
Decrease the cost of rent 
That your bond stays with the rta and just gets transferred across when you have to move.
"Real estate agents should have to offer a payment system that has no charge. We get charged an extra 2% when we transfer our rent, that should be illegal"
Ensure properties are maintained
allowing emotional support animals with supported documents 
Freedom to have pets and be treated as a responsible tenant 
"Once I’m in a property it’s usually a great experience. I struggle to find properties with pets, and dislike that agents can have you sign to agree not to apply for other properties while your application is in progress."
Make rent prices cheaper!
Put some proper rules around rental agents and their treatment of renters
Pets allowed in all residences (with renters responsible for repairing any related damages). 
"The number of home inspections,currently my agent does them 3-4 months - 6 monthly would be less stressful."
The state of rental properties 
More policing of realestates mistreating renters and rented properties.
better protection from scrupulous agents
Feeling secure in the longevity of my rental so that I can invest into the house to make it my own home
"Pets to be approved or a bond for the possibility of damage 
More lenancy with decoration e.g hanging pictures 
More say in rental increases and costs "
"Owner complying with fixing things in the house. 
Owner replying to emails sent on problems. "
"Real estates agents don’t do viewings on weekends, but I need to work to be able to pay my rent. Pet’s should be more welcome. Repairs should be carried out, especially when they are a safety concern."
Make it easier to own pets in a rental and faster repair times 
"Rental prices - as a student on Youth Allowance, it's incredibly difficult to rent somewhere suitably close to where I study in the city that provides me with decent security and quality of living."
So much damage done by bad tenants. Repairs are very costly. Agents say it is normal wear and tear so you it costs a lot for the owners. 
To a a fee free option when paying rent. Most agents now use a third parties agencies to collect rent these incur a fee that the tenant is responsible for. 
Better property manager
"Its NRAS
My worry is ""what becomes of me when my 10 year Tenancy Expires""?  My position doesn't look promising from my viewpoint. My rent will be unaffordable."
"The real estate need to not worry how clean the house is but if the house has been destroyed.
Picking on things like fluff in door runners isn’t a major issue. "
Pets always allowed. 
lack of care from property managers
Longer notice period required for a tenant to terminate their lease.
Having renters and landlords being required to give the same period of notice for ending a lease (without breach)
"make it cheaper for single parents to access appropriate affordable housing, of both genders. The wait list is quite long. 
Make it easier to apply for housing assistance, implement a online form. 

Make it harder for bad tenants to keep trashing houses with family members names, harsher penalties for fraudulent behaviour relating to them getting houses to trash. "
The bond check out experience is terrible. A real estate can find one tiny speck of dirt and you are at their beck and call to keep them happy.
"More rights to the occupants, like at the moment everything depends upon the owner or the rental company to do, like if one want to get the house painted or any change or service of air con, the occupants must be given at least one time each year or each season to request this."
Allowing Pets in all properties. 
Set rules and regulations that are clear to everyone and make it mandatory that any adjudicators and RTA staff must have their real estate license
Only so many open houses at a time to respect the person who is renting the property.
More independence from real estate/owner and more long term housing security.
"Allow pets, better maintenance, more security to ask maintenance without risk of losing lease"
Less inspections.. Every 4 months or so is a bit invasive if you are a long term tenant who has proved time and time again that you look after the property. 
Affordability.  More security - availability of longer-term rental options
Commitment of long term lease (2-5 years)
Having more assurance that things will be fixed by professionals and not dodgy DIY by property owners.
More pet acceptable properties
Better quality service from property managers. 
"Should be able to transfer bond from one property to the next.
Should have an independent body to do the exit reports. "
Better advice from the RTA by call center people who have actually worked in real estate so the advice being given is in line with the way the property manager is legally required to manage the property. Will stop disputes because we're all getting the same information.
All rental properties allowing pets.
"To have things fixed when they need to be fixed. House owner leaves the rental unsafe, it rains inside and there is mould yet he is somehow is allowed to keep it like that. "
Better policies for protecting Renters rights.
"Lessen the cost per week, it's as much as, if not more than a mortgage.
Paying out over half of ones weekly income on rent alone is ridiculous."
"I am on the DSP and would love cheaper rent.
being able to have more choice with pet friendly units and being able to hang pictures on the wall"
"A simplified, standardised system to lodge and track requests between tenants and landlords/real estate agents. Also please contacts should not be able to be ceased early by the landlord except in very limited circumstance, and in these circumstances tenants should be compensated."
"Less uncertainty, hate the feeling that landlord/owner could decide to sell any time and we would have to find somewhere else. Rentals are hard to come by and this is home to us and has been for a long time. Would liek to have surety that we can stay as long as we wish as long as we are caring for property etc."
"Longer terms available after preliminary 1 year.
"
Definitely that pets should be allowed.
Allowing renters to have freedom in their homes. Especially the right to have pets. Much more needs to be done to encourage people to adopt pets from shelters and a huge part of that is landlord's bias against medium and large dog breeds. 
Tenants and landlords should be required to give the same amount of notice e.g. 4 weeks  to end a tenancy.
That me as an owner of a rental property could be able to evict tennants for not paying rent ....its really unfair that i have to keep my mortgage payments up but a tenant can not pay rent for a couple of weeks before i can start the eviction process
"Provide a Sustainability Declaration equal to what buyers were presented before it was repealed.  The land lord simply answers if there have been any sustainability improvements or assessments, and attaches such documents for inspection by prospective tenants.  There would be no obligation for either NATHERS rating, but to disclose such if it has been done.  Best of all the Sustainability Declaration should provide Actual utility bills fro the property if the landlord has access to them.  For rental properties it would be good if previous tenants could elect to share such for consideration with successors."
Having a cooling off period for tenancy agreements. 
I would like to hang pictures on the wall. I would be happy for the landlord to have the hooks put up professionally etc. 
Greater flexibility in regards to pets
"'- Reduce renting price particularly around inner city and suburbs. 
- Owners should make regular visits to the property to inspect and maintain the grounds 
- Improve communication and legal rights between tenants and rental owners when it comes to property damage and breaking lease 
- Allow pets if possible "
Force agents to allow centrepay
"Real Estate agent and landlords should have a time limit on fixing any problems with the property, no matter how minor the problem is."
Tenants who feel like they can pay their rent when it suits! As if the landlord can act as their defacto bank! No matter that the bank will deduct mortgage payments on a particular date irrrespective of whether tenants have actually paid.
Allow tenants to have at least one pet.
Having to prove that my partners dog is house broken & it's for her since she is bed redden & our GP recommended her having a pet.
The ability to negotiate some lease terms more 
Continue to allow no grounds notice to leave at end of tenancy
"I am a property investor and as such I have people renting property from me. I am happy with how things are as we are, although not averse to change. "
More room for negotiation for longer term leases for both renters and owners
Realestate Agents need to be kept in line. They get away with doing the wrong thing far too often.
"More control over the place, less risk of liability, clearer responsibility for landlords to fix issues and maintain property. "
"Make owner fix maintenance problems with property more quickly - or even at all!
Get owners to install energy saving options and solar power"
"Ability to break lease contract by paying an exit fee (such as a month worth of rent), without paying the rent until the end of the contract"
"Being able to put family photos up, I can’t even put pictures of my grandchildren up."
the waiting time for repairs can sometimes depend on the property manager company
Have more rights for the landlord which are currently skewed in favour of the tenant. We invest the money yet have limited rights.
What I would change to improve my renting experience is being allowed to have a pet and be allowed to put pictures up on the walls.
"MORE PRIVACY, LESS INSPECTIONS, TREAT 'TENANTS' AS PEOPLE NOT A COMMODITY TO BE EXPLOITED!"
"Fair and reasonable expectations and requirements. Renters should not have to leave a property in a higher condition than when they moved in and real estates/landlords should attend to property maintenance when there are issues, not just ignore. System needs to be fair for both renters, landlords & agents. "
One thing is to be able to meet the owner so I can disgus different things like how as  renter we can do things to the house to keep the house in tip top condition. Also if things do need repairing to be able to let the owner know so that it can be repaired quickly even though there is a real estate involved as sometimes it takes a long time for them to contact the owner or if they do as it does become a real problem sometimes.
Tenants who damage rental houses extensively should be charged with damaging property by police.
Better regulation in property managers
I would like to see much longer term rental contracts or even rolling contracts that don’t need to be renewed every 6-12 months. There is a lot of stress around wondering whether you’re going to receive a notice to vacate at the end of the rental period every year. 
"Allow pets, they make the same amount of mess as kids/adults plus BOND is designed to cover any destruction of property. And if they disturb other neighbours the tenants should receive notices and then the pet could be evicted. "
Remove the leaving fee (one week rent) when need to break the lease. Moving as is it’s very expensive and there’s sometimes unexpected consequences when you forced to move and it feels unfair! ..at least some exceptions like for low income families and/or for easy rented properties and as by high location domand etc..  ..the expensives what’s w swapping a tenant could be covered in weekly rent. Also some rental properties are way too expensive for low income families.. if you wanna be in certain place within a good school catchment area!! With such a huge domain..Impossible!
The ability to pay for cosmetic changes such as hiring a painter to change wall colours or hanging up pictures or improving the house such as getting solar installed at houses with long term leases.
The ability for long term leasing with fixed pricing increases so that everything is transparent.
Inspections should not occur every 3 months. 6 months is a better interval to respect the tentants privacy. 
I’d really like online access to my receipts etc. I don’t get any of that stuff from my agent. 
Landlords too picky over tiny faults to justify taking money from deposit 
"I'd like where I'm renting to feel more like my home, rather than feeling that I'm on eggshells if the landlord feels like chucking me out or raising the rent unduly as happened at last place I rented."
Pets and more support from the landlord or owner in Regards to fixing issues
landlord fixing things
"Allow pets, allow hanging pictures on walls. Ensure inspections are carried out properly before a tenant moves in! Real estate agents should be more fair about the state of cleanliness that they expect tenants to accept and what they will accept from tenants. Real estate agents should be more fair in general. "
Real estate agents having too much power.
ability to hang up paintings 
The feeling and security that if we share a gripe with a landlord or contact the rta that our lives arent going to be made more difficult moving to new properties.
Lease security - the ability to sign for longer leases (which also ties into rent control - government overseeing rates of increases).
Ability to have privacy options installed with a tight timeframe EG Curtains or blinds.
"Less invasive inspections, and no routine photo taking unless there is clear damage to a property "
Less frequent rental inspections when there have been no issues on multiple occasions. 
This is the first time I have rented in over 30 years and quite frankly I have had a fantastic experience since I have been in the rental for the last 10 months
"I’d like to adopt a dog for companionship. My family always had a dog, and since I’ve been an adult, out on my own, I’ve missed that. "
"More rights for tenants. Its currently so difficult to get bond back. Property managers nitpick and blame tenants for construction faults but if you can't prove it wasn't your fault, you pay. No room for wear and tear either. Any difference...you pay."
"Standardise property management practices. Some property managers do a glance over condition report, others so a detailed report, this poses major problems come vacating time."
"Ability it add gardens/plant to yard, hang photos to a wall as to make a home feel like a home "
"Being able to hang pictures, unreasonable claims on bond and feeling like no power to fight it."
The ability to do minor changes to the rental like hang a picture without the need for approval.  Have a pet without the owner saying i can't. 
What can and cannot be done during routine inspections. Changing the ability for agents to photograph personal items to send back to the owner to see the house is being cared for. 
"Less intrusive inspections.  Once we have established our reputation as a reliable and good tennant we should not have to put up with the too frequent inspections.  Agents turn up towing along random people (trainees, ownders etc...) - all having a gawk at our lives.  This is mostly driven not by the ned for these inspection but the need for agents to charge owners for them."
"Ensure complex managers properly maintain public grounds in townhouse complexes, and have the authority to take action against noisy residents."
Animals being allowed in rentals. 
"More affordable rent, more rights for renters."
Easier access to renters with low income. The ‘you must be earning more than 30% of the rent’ rule blocks out anyone on government assistance who doesn’t have anyone to be guarantor or the ability to live in share housing. 
"Allowing pets, reasonable affordability"
"I keep receiving notices every week that my rent is late when actually it is always paid on time and have complained many times to the estate agent but they keep coming every week, sometimes even a second one comes the following week "
Noise management of neighbours
Behaviour of property managers
Supply and demand. There are not enough rental properties available and it's been this way for years. Particularly hard if you have dogs. Be nice if the govt contributed to and/or supplied (or demanded from private developers) more social housing.
Keep the costs down somehow and STOP property managers and owners treating our bond like it’s their entitlement at the end of a lease. The worst part is when you’re blamed for causing “damage” to the property despite photo evidence clearly showing the state of the property prior to the lease agreement date of commencement. 
"Fairer rental prices 
Landlords allowing pets
More availability"
"The properties we’ve been looking at look nothing like the photos and are typically maintained poorly. We are looking at executive homes and am disappointed overall at the quality and extremely high prices. It is also a foregone conclusion that your bond will never be returned, even if you keep your home in better shape than when originally rented. A huge cash grab for owners as far as I’m concerned. "
The imbalance of power landlords can use against tenants particularly regarding return of bond over items of wear and tear.
"Inspections, Agents are not flexible on inspection times they should be 6 monthly or yearly, as  renters we have quite often had to take days off from work to comply with inspections, I do not believe that anyone should have the right to enter your home without you being present.."
"Punitive measures for landlords/real estate managers who fail to provide correct documentation that often lead to illegal eviction. (I got threatened with no paperwork to be evicted in 2 weeks. I eventually won with RTA but nothing happened to landlords.. only the right to continue a contract where they could continue to threaten other things illegally). 

Better training for real estate business owners. Transparency (such as a website) showing real estate businesses with their blacklists, formal complaints so land lords can make better decisions about who to choose. "
"The way the cost of renting keeps going up each year no matter how long you have been renting in the same property and have always paid on time and hardly any maintenance has been done in the unit accept minor things like window flyscreen replaced, breaking down of the hot water system and cupboards in the hallway had to be replaced due to the damage done by the hot water system leaking and only propped up not replaced. Yet the rent has increase.
The kitchen is that old over 60 years and is made out of the old chipboard and is starting to rot. This needs ti be replaced. 
I have been renting this unit since 2004 admittedly the owner was quite generous with keeping the rent cost down at first but last 3/4 years the rent has increased quite a bit. Don't quite understand how they can do this."
Better maintenance of property including trees. 
Less rent increases 
More freedom to make the house into a home by being allowed to bring in a dog after moving in.
"Make tenants more responsible for their actions. If they breach their lease, they simply go to court & plead financial hardship & the judge let’s them off at the expense of the landlord."
The availability of longer term leases - up to 5 years - to allow for security.
Smoking laws particularly in confined living spaces such as apartments and townhouses. 
Having pets without having to ask
"To be able to hang pictures on the walls. To have affordable rent prices in the inner city for decent sized spaces/safe spaces/secure spaces. I was paying a lot of money for a very small flat in inner-city Brisbane that had very noisy neighbours, was not very secure and was not insulated, so very hot in Summer. I moved out to the regions, where I pay much cheaper rent, for a very spacious and lovely home, however, I commute to work, three hours a day. I also would like to be able to put nails in the walls to hang up artwork that I have bought over the years. 3M hooks don't do the trick! they fall off the walls and have wrecked precious pieces that I own. I'd like it to be easier to rent with a cat. Especially as I'm a responsible person and wouldn't allow my cat to wreck the home (just my stuff!). Affordable housing though, is the biggest issue. Affordable, safe, secure housing. "
Better rent choices for people with pets
"3 monthly house inspections
"
Remove real estate agents to allow a relationship to develop between the landlord and the renter. I wonder if anything we request is passed on - it takes ages for some things to get back to us. I think there is also a constant roll-over of people at the agent so there’s never a person who is up to date with our situation.
The ability to access a long term rental the way commercial rentals can and the ability to garden freely. The absolute scam that is the hoops one jumps through to get your bond back by having to pay commercial cleaners. 
Greater security of tenancy. 
Give landlords more rights to manage bad tenants.
"Maintenance - took three months in the middle of summer to get our air con fixed, three years to get the fenced replaced and window screens still need repairing three years on."
More flexibility towards owning pets
Clear guidelines. Rta are hopless in explaining right clearly and are inconsistent 
Rude real estate agent inspections. In my spotless home she dared comment on dust above a door frame! Inspections should be realistic. This is my home.  Not a brand new show home on TV. 
"for landlords or agents not to raise rent on lease renewals, when tenants are willing to maintain the property and do things to improve the grounds"
Try and make it more homely 
"Tenant must have more rights, viz: provide guidance regarding ""clear and tidy"" to stop landlords abusing this ""obligation"". Also similar regarding ""bond cleans"". "
Allow long term flexible leases
A way to forward or stop previous owner/tenant mail coming to the property.
The government to take more care about property owners
"Allowing pets,  
Putting my art around the house, 
Not being made to feel like a sub citizen when having inspections, 
That wear and tear is recognised as a part of living"
"Pets allowed and no fault evictions as well as lease terms, they are too short."
Allowing pets on the property & any damage incurred by pets is payable by the tenant.
Less house inspections 
"One thing I would change to improve the renting experience for tenants would be more protections for tenants in regards to lease renewals. For example, tenants live in fear of asking for too much routine maintenance to be carried out in case the owner/agent decides not to renew for this reason alone. I believe if an owner/ agent decides not to renew, they must provide a valid reason, which is able to be disputed by the tenant and enforced by the RTA if necessary. The fear of not being offered a lease renewal because a tenant is vocal about their rights gives the property owner a great advantage and enables them to avoid their responsibilities without recourse."
Once signing a lease if the owner decides to put the house on the market the tenant should be able to break the lease with no consequences.
Too many forms with insufficient value to references
"Real estate rental inspections demanding such a high standard like  a full bond clean every few months, and its like they are not happy unless they find something to complain about. Forgetting that there is still people living in the house."
Improve the (low) quality and (poor) attitude of the rental agents.
Property managers not current with legislation. Not able to contact property manager and calls go unanswered. Incorrect charging of water. Not repairing property..
The ability/choice to have a pet cat or dog without needing to seek approval.
There needs to be accountability by agents. There is currently nothing that assists a landlord when tenant problems & agents do not manage property properly
Less increases in rent
There needs to be more accountability for agents who collect fees to manage properties but do not always do their job
Quicker repairs. Hang photos.  Allow pets 
Owners more receptive to tenants have pets. Decrease amount of routine inspections if tenant has shown to be a good renter. 
"Affordability. Even the most basic, dirty, rundown, u maintained properties (many breach fire or building codes) , are out of reach of the working poor"
Once a notice to leave is issued a tenant should be permitted to vacate during the notice period. Landlords and agents are using this as a way to pressure tenants to sign leases
Laws on price increases 
Better communication between tenants and agents and rta
To be able to call out your own repairers instead of having to wait for the realestate and owners
"More pet friendly affordable accommodation, especially small dwellings for older single people to live alone"
It should be easier to recover funds from tenants for damage or unpaid rent when they vacate.
"I have been in the same property for more than 4 years with property inspections every 3 months. I would like to have them  progressively reduced  as the tenancy period in the same dwelling lengthens: something like- after 2 years, inspections every 4 months, after 4 years unspections every 6 months etc."
Not pay for water! Owners want to the grass to be kept alive and green and expect us to water it but we have to pay for the excess water useage for the property! 
Lower rent versus income ratio.
Change the attitude towards pets.  
Better real estate interaction with tenants.
The quarterly inspections. We’ve never had any issues in the years we’ve been there. Yet every quarter someone just gets to come into my home look around with no regard for us. 
Making tenants more accountable
"I am fortunate I’m not paying over the top rent. Although I know others are, rent must be affordable for families "
consistent information with landlord and body corporates
Allow pets - and longer leases
"Set up a register of reputable landlords and tenants and stop giving the tenants the privileges of a home owner. They are renters - with no risk to a huge capital investment.


"
Being able to install hooks or furnishings to the walls. Installings shelves etc would improve the house and raise its value.
Increase fairness and equity. Stop punishing great tenants for the actions of poor tenants. One rule doesn't fit all.
"Greater rights to decorate my own home, have a pet and a guarantee that a landlord couldn’t arbitrarily terminate my tenancy. Moving house at the whim of a landlord is expensive and extremely disruptive. "
The time in which landlords get repairs done around the house. Especially electrical issues. 
The unrealistic standard when leaving a property 
"Minimum repairs required by owners. Owners do not always get works completed and f they do, they take a long time. I know of a friend that waited 2 weeks without a stove because the owner was getting quotes. His only recourse was to issue the owner/agent with an NTRB. He could not terminate the tenancy because he needed to be in the area. This just enforces that tenants only have a 'pretend' power in the renting equation. "
As a young person or first time renter it’s very easy to get “taken for a ride” by agents and landlords. I feel there needs to be better education on what people are signing up for and also stressing the importance of a thorough entry condition report.
"Have been happy, but it was very hard to find somewhere to rent as we were previously interstate home owners and had no rental history (although had plenty of $ in the bank to pay rent up front if required)"
Make it mandatory for essential  repairs to be seen to quickly.
To be able to make our rentals more homey
Change to better real estate agents .our property is deteriorating because of real estate allowing tenants to damage property. 
Allow townhouses to have small animals
The time it takes for landlords to fix stuff that goes wrong with the houses 
Less inspections for long term tenants. Maybe once every 6 months instead of every 3 months. 
"Rent is far too expensive, we are renting and old farm house in cedarton, the gutters are rusting off the roof and the landlord refuses to have them fixed, the drains ae blocked, the pest control was never done.. but dont forget to pay your $350 pw or you'll be out on you ass. Renting is crap always has been alway will be."
Real estates using the entry report as a reference when a tenant exits a property.  
Pets allowed as standard unless there is a particular reason.
"Less routine inspections 
"
The Agents actually knowing the rules and laws. So many agents do not know the law and are bossy and condescending 
"Being able to contact an owner to discuss repairs, as my real estate took 12mths and still hadn't fixed my problem"
In over 30 years of renting I have NEVER received my full bond back even though I usually spend a week cleaning the place before I leave. The real estate people ALWAYS find something to charge you for.  
I am an owner and I am fine for tenants who wish to place paintings or pictures on a wall provided the tenancy agreement includes a clause that the tenants will ensure the condition of the walls when leaving the property are back to the original condition.
"Both agents and landlords treat tenants with disdain. I understand there are some bad apples but we are nevertheless all tied to the same brush. When leaving a property natural wear and tear are not taken into account and the tenant's bond is expected to renovate the owners property. Most owners put off repairs so they can use the bond money for repairs that should have been done way earlier.

Short term leases discourage tenants from treating the property as their home with strict restrictions on small and simple improvements (eg garden and wall hooks) simply being banned altogether.
"
"Factoring in my excellent rental history. I have never had any complaints or ever missed a payment, yet I am treated with deep suspicion whenever signing up for a new lease. After years of study, I even now own a higher wage than average, yet this suspicion persists. When I signed my latest lease, I was told that I must put my garbage outside -- as if this is a persistent problem that all tenants would need to be reminded about. It made me feel awful."
"Lower rent prices, 
Timely maintenance "
Ensure the dispute process is transparent and easy to access for all parties.
"The system to be fair to both owners and tenants
. Eg same amount of notice to leave , owners need to give 2 months but tenants only 2 weeks, 
If tenants get behind in rent and you go to QCAT, if the tenants have children they are given extra time to vacate even though by that time they are at least 2 months behind, I have had owners loose houses due to this
"
"The agent takes photos of every room in my house on inspections. To me this is an invasion of privacy. I could understand this if there were serious issues with the house. I believe it comes down to trust between the landlord and agent, if there is no trust between these two then the tenants privacy is at risk."
Nothing. Never had a problem. 
More equal rights between owners and tenants.
We currently have 2 year leases but this is not common. I would like to be able to sign longer leases with fewer home inspections after the first 12 months eg twice a year instead of 3 times a year
Decreasing time between inspections if you have been renting a property for a long time and have a proven record for caring for that property
"We rent from Main Roads Qld. While minor repairs are carried out promptly, repairs over $500 take longer than they should to be rectified. My husband is a builder but he is not allowed to do repairs for free if product needed is supplied. e.g paint. It took 2 years to have a drain unblocked which caused flooding every time it rains. Guttering is rusted out. House needs painting inside & out. Bathroom needs tiles re-grouted. My 88yr old Father lives in a very hot room that has an air conditioner that has never worked but they won't replace. All repairs need to be addressed without fear of eviction or rental increases. You don't know a house till you live in it. We all want pleasant living conditions."
"Communication has been incredibly poor. Our first inspection was without notice because they had failed to inform us properly (sent email to incorrect address). Our property manager has been changed without warning as well, with the previous one ignoring our emails and the new one unaware of any ongoing issues because they were not documented properly.

Maintenance issues are 'fixed' in the cheapest possible way with no thought to long-term safety, often in such a way that the issues arrise again as soon as weeks later.
We were also promised engineers visit yearly to check the house's structural integrity, but when I raised concerns and requested one visit sooner I was promised this was possible, it still hasn't happened.

From the day we moved in we complained about the aircon unit. When we put in a work order they were fast to send someone out to quote replacing the system, but it has been over a month with no word despite us phoning to ask about the situation."
Legislation regarding rent increase  
"Fewer inspections. Inspections every 12 weeks is an invasion of our privacy. Inspections, whilst a necessary evil, should be limited to twice a year. Clearly where there are issues to be addressed by the tenant during such inspections, then schedule a follow up to ensure they have addressed the issues identified. Also, allow tenants to hang paintings and photos to at least make the place feel like a home."
Pets allowed in more properties and being allowed to hang pictures 
Owner maintenance levels should be higher. 
"More rights for renters. More people can not afford to own their own home and high rental prices mean that most people are having to share with others or spend a large amount of their income on rent in order to live alone or with a partner. Therefore, I think there needs to be stricter rules about owners raising rents to protect tenants. People don't want to have the stress and expense of moving every 12 months because owners raise rent or evict us. So some security for us, perhaps longer leases or locked rental prices for a number of years would be ideal. "
Being treated with more respect as a tenant
To make it easier for single parents to get a home that they don’t have to beg and plead for. I’ve ended up in a suburb to far away from my work and my kids school but now can’t affors to move. I’d also like to be able to have a pet. 
Control of rent increases
"Improve inspection report. i.e. including some general photographs, improve by using a better grading system of condition that both Renter and Owner/Management Company must agree on.
i.e. Kitchen condition rating out of 10 - 1 meaning terrible and 10 meaning fantastic. Renters Grade. Owners Grade."
More honest realestate agents and those who don't do the right thing legally being held accountable. 
Automatic rent receipts so I know where I am paid to and the payment has been received. 
"Not allowed pets.
Compulsary 3 monthly inspections. I am not a drug pusher or on the game thank you.
Lack of respect. I pay good money for a service but agents and owners treat me like I am somehow an inferior being instead of a paying customer. Worse still is being used as a cash cow to be milked to upgrade their property, by trying to steal my bond when they force me to move out usually by unfair rent increases simply because they can. I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MOVE 3 TIMES IN 10 YEARS!"
"In a period where electricity prices are paramount, owners should ensure that the property is focused towards energy efficiency.  Currently we are renting a property that has solar panels on the roof.  However, we do not receive any benefit for it with any credits going back to the owner.  Yet the hot water service, oven, etc is all electric. "
"Ability to put things on walls, even if its a set number.  I have art from travelling. 
Ability to own a pet.
Not being told off during inspections for having my clothes rack out drying my washing, i was told they would return once id put it away.  "
More security and stability for tenants
"Pet approved automatically unless the owner has a genuine concern with a particular pet.
Approval to hang pictures on walls
I do not understand this statement: ""I can ensure others do what is required of them without fear e.g. of eviction, property damage, higher fees"". Who are ""others""? Family? Friends? Landlords? Renters? How can I ensure anyone else does anything?"
"Having a rental tenants score or rating so good tenants can easily get properties. 
Having to come up a second lot of bond when shifting. Already have 4 weeks bond on existing property and then having to come up with another 4 weeks bond plus 2 weeks rent in advance for the new property makes it extremely difficult to move."
Was hard to find places that were affordable and take dogs
"Pets being more acceptable.
House inspections to focus on condition of house and general cleanliness, not on one cup left in sink and washing basket to be folded"
"I think it's unfair that companies managing properties can take a % of your allowances from the pension. when the government gives us utility allowance and age pension supplements, they should not be included as INCOME."
Setting a maximum amount a landlord can charge per week. I grew up in the Netherlands and they already had this system in place 35 years ago. 
Property managers have all the power & control & generally are unwilling to negotiate on anything. Because so many people are looking for “affordable” accommodation agents can afford to be extremely picky & at times it’s quite unfair.
"Better communication between real estates, landlords and tenants. "
"Respect! Respect that renters are just like home owners who work, are single, have family and friends. The difference being that renters have not, for varying reasons, been able to purchase their own home. And that should include many realestate agencts who could do with leaving their ' nose in the air' attitudes at the office when attending open house for rentals. Without renters there would be less favourable investment opportunities in real estate."
"Cheaper rent 
More rights 
"
I would like to own a dog and not be limited in my rental property choices because I have a pet.
Pets should be allowed in all properties with the tenant responsible for any damage. Like in Victoria!
treating renters as second class citizens has got to stop. Even when it comes to the tribunal there is very little consideration for renters - the system is geared towards owners.
Lower rent price
"Set reasonable time frames for problems to be rectified and repairs or maintenance completed, to reduce inconvienience to tenants. - If a problem that effects the tenants enjoyment of the property arises, like a faulty oven or sliding door or window that won't slide, then the owner might have 3 weeks to rectify the problem. If repairs are not completed in this time then rent paid will be reduced (by a set formula e.g. 20%) until problem is fixed! "
The real estate agents should have less rentals to look after so they have time to look after each property properly
"Allow applicants to have their pets. It's not right to expect an animal be given away, or worse, put down because they aren't allowed. Almost everyone has a pet but the rentals that do allow are few and far between."
Tenants should be allowed to keep pets everywhere
"Provide ability to remove tenants for breaches more quickly. Particularly for non payment of rent and damage to property. Currently the process takes longer than the bond will cover, especially if there is both damage and non payment of rent."
"Access to previous rental history (disclosure) of the property you wish to rent, as in information about past residents, (if and why they were evicted), information given to prospective home owners by law."
Stop being treated liked second class citizen
"Make Real Estate Agents look after the needs of the tenant as well as the owners, instead of only the ownwers"
The ability to terminate a lease quicker for tenants who do not pay their rent
More transparency between the property managers and tenants. Too many property managers do not work with tenant. Pets also should be included without owner consent. A lot of tenants treat their pets like family but it’s sadly not considered 
The cost for elderly and lower rent. 
To be able to feel like the house I rent is truly a home with inspections less often and invasive and significant repairs done in a timely manner ie within weeks rather than years. To be able to live securely in the property for longer - longer lease.
That renting Prices should be capped not keep going up.
"Being able to have a pet, put pictures on the walls. "
"Allow pets, and have consideration for the renters.  I recently tried to rent a 2 acre property and I have 3 cattle dogs as I currently live rural and they are working dogs.  I make 80+k per year, rent was $600 week and was told that I don't make enough money.  wtf?"
"Just to know that one has security is the most important thing to myself and most likely lots of others out there too, especially when you have no Family.
"
To make it a more equal business arrangement between tenant and landlord rather than an authoritarian approach towards tenants. 
"Ensure the owner still has the right to a well maintained property. (Having to ensure that tenants return the property to its original condition simply does not work most of the time. Damaged goods become repaired goods, but usually not equal to the original standard.)"
Hanging on wall make the home more homely. Pets make the home more friendly 
Being able to have pets and inspections feeling like my privacy is being invaded 
We had to pay a higher rent. Much higher than we would have to live as a single Mum with 2 children with a dog. With a dog we ended up paying $50 more each week compared. 
"1. Longer term leases 
2. Pets allowed in all properties 
2. Ability to hang art/pictures on the walls. 
3. Ability to customise house for the length of tenancy (paint walls etc) 
4. Better maintenance and faster repairs. "
Getting things fixed in a timely manner for example leaking taps. 
The yearly increases in rent
"People renting not maintaining the standards of the neighbour. Like not keeping lawns and footpath mowed and trimmed. Leaving local newspapers lying around the footpath and expecting neighbours to clean up. Erecting star pickets posts and with wire netting which not allowed under the developers conveyances. Signing lease which states small toy inside dog then landlord finds that the dog is large black barking outside dog.  Therefore the one thing that I would improve is that tenants pay more in bond and rent just in case they decide to acquire a pet.
"
"Tenants bond isn’t enough to cover when they vacate. More than 50% of people stop paying rent within the month prior to vacating, then won’t bother to clean properly or repair damages, costing owners money that insurance won’t cover or when some do, the owner still has to pay the excess or Qcat will allow to tenants to get away with it."
To be able to hang family photos up to make it feel more like home.
"Owners would have to make repairs within a specified time frame - specifically no longer than one month - and it shouldn't be up to tenant to take matters to QCAT to have these actioned and still no repairs then have to go to private litigation!
Real Estates hold tenants in complete disregard - no consideration given to personal space/life when entering for inspections.
 Consideration given to difference between long term and short term tenants - that is long term tenants shouldn't be constantly subjected to 3 monthly house inspections and short term leases.
Tenants shown to be good, trustworthy, treating house with respect and long term should be rewarded -eg: solar panels installed, less house inspections, rent not increasing, improvements done to home etc.
Real Estates should not be able to require to see a persons income and properties should not be able to be charged above a certain percentage of it's value. 
"
Already we have too much leaning in tenants favour by rules and regulations . It’s time to give owners a fair deal. 
"That tenants report problems promptly so as they can be rectified - such as leaks with taps and toilets because water is a costly item and tenants really don’t worry unless they are paying for the water.
"
The ability to have pets and not such strict ruling on body corporate 
Greater rights to rent with pets
More rental properties where pets are allowed would make it a lot easier to find a good home for the family. 
Allow tenants to have pets. Landlords should allow all tenants to have a pet.
If the requirements for the property owners to properly maintain their properties were more stringent. 
More accessibility to the owners for discussion around home improvements 
"More respect for renters. We have been renting for 21 years and have found that real estate agents treat renters as if we are second class citizens. This is done through the way they at times have spoken to us and always replied to maintenance requests. We have never made a late payment with our rent, have always cared for the property inside and out, as if it is our own. We have found that owners can be reluctant to make basic repairs or it can take months and at times years."
"so far, it has been good, but to date we have had great tenants who have cared for our property."
Real estate agents and owners who actually follow the rules.
Landlords completing maintenance within a reasonable timeframe. 
"Ability to treat premises like it was my home and care for it
 "
Allowing pets in more properties 
"Have the real estate more accountable for there action in regards to taking bond and reason for not renewing the lease. I had two bad real estates that I feel should not been operated. One I did get my bond back after wining it in QCAT. The other kick me out over a cook top that I was more then willing to pay half for. there need to be reform on how real estate conduct them self, there are good real estate and there are some shocking one."
"When breaking a lease there should be a restriction on the time for that, like in NSW - where if you break your lease in the 1st half of your tenancy you pay 6 weeks rent and the advertising costs, and in the 2nd half it is 4 weeks plus advertising costs - this is much fairer to tenants and would give agents & landlords better incentive to lease property in a timely manner. "
Develop Minimum Maintenance Standards with an accompanying method for tenants to access repairs if not standards are not met. 
Ability to do things around the house and yard within reason. I.E hang pictures 
If I buy an ice cream I do not have to give the vendor documentation dating back 15 years.  Their is a huge conflict of interest in as much as the real estate agents primary job is to represent the landlords.  Yet it is the Real estate agents that do all inspections and assessments.  We now have quarterly inspections.  Do owners have to turn their residents upside down every 3 months.  I can hear the reader saying that you are not required to turn the place upside down every 3 months but the real estate agents who are invariably keen to impress their clients are inclined to place as much pressure as possible on the renters. This imbalance of power and conflict of interest tends to play out in a negative way with all renters I have known.  On Two occasions my family was treated poorly by the real estate agents because we were very very good renters and they did not want to loose us. The point is that business is about making a profit and for one reason or another it is always in the interest of the real estate agents to place another restrictive and exploitative interpretation and application of the rules over renters.  I am a quality control expert and the more you monitor and sample a business process the more efficient the system becomes. especially if you are not doing the work(left to the renters). Why stop at 3 monthly inspections why not weekly or daily or hourly. Do you see the point?  Who is the effective arbiter over these inspections?  Is it The Rental board who are absent or the real estate agents who make recommendations for the next lease. The reason we are currently at quarterly inspections is that some mathematician / accountant like myself( I hold an honours degree Maths and am an accountant) has determined that four inspections a year is the best mix of cost benefit for the realtors and have sold this marketing model onto the owners committee blah blah blah.  Who is never involved in this process at any time but other than homelessness has to deal with the consequences(the renter)?
Black and white rules not all the grey areas. Property managers have their hands tied behind their backs trying to manage outgoing tenants who argue about what level of clean is satisfactory and ingoing tenants who have a higher standard and want everything spotless. From a health and safety point of view professionals should ALWAYS be engaged for cleaning and carpet cleaning. Property management training in QLD is a joke. 2 yr average career length before people realise how hard is is and leave. Young ones come in with their heads in the clouds and give good pms a bad rep. 
"It is invasive for property managers to be able to take photos of the inside of your property, this practice should be banned. It is a security risk for your belongings to be photographed and a gross invasion of privacy. In addition to this after the fixed period of tenancy has ended this should become a continuing lease as in the NSW system, the current system of renewing a fixed term stifles completion amongst landlords. Qld should follow the Victorian system of allowing pets unless there is exceptional circumstances not to. The period for identifying issues with a property is also inadeqiate and needs to be doubled. After the first year of renting, inspections should be limited to twice a year. "
Not treating a tenant as their prisoners in total. My best experience was when I was renting from the landlord directly. Real State and property managers act as if we’re criminals for not having a house. 
"more rights for renters, agents to fix issues when problems arise, allow renters to make changes in the home "
"The cost of renting, for an Old Age Pensioner such as myself, is too expensive. I would love to have the opportunity to live in a Government pensioner unit where I could live amongst people my own age as living amongst younger people is not a pleasant life."
"Seems to work pretty well but sometimes agents are too invasive. Too many 24 hours notices for various things that I am sure could be condensed into one trip. The agents must know when they have checks for things like, smoke alarms, electrics, etc coming up."
limit the powers of rental managers.
Pest and other sprays (like mould) not have to be paid for out of pocket
Easier to rent with pets
Agents should advocate for both lanlord and  tenants.
"Allow pets without it being up to the owner. It's ridiculous that I pay for exclusive use for a long term home, where I also pay a bond & am liable for any excessive damage beyond regular wear & tear, yet I need to ask the owner's permission to own a pet.

I don't need to ask the owner's permission to have a child or to do all sorts of other equally potentially damaging things, yet pets require permission that is almost impossible to get. I've asked in every rental I've ever had, I've been rejected every time."
"Having lomg term rental house options (more than 1 year) with proper maintenance  completed (when asked and needed) and stable consistent rent a week, with no rental increase for long term renters"
Would be great if was cheaper but also do i need a inspection every three months i am a long term renter with one real estate
A better system for identifying and penalising dodgy property managers/landlords. 
The onus of repair of pet caused damage being that of the renter. 
Agents need to respect tenants as much as they respect owners. Without one you would not have the other. Agents are often rude and condescending to tenants.
Agents not ignoring or not caring about disruptive and noisy neighbours. Current Agent property manager is excellent.
Allow dogs in rental properties - I would be happy to pay a further pet bond. Not allow weight of dog to be determining factor since not all large dogs are very active dogs. 
Allow pets or at least one pet. 
"Real estate agents need to have better service levels especially for maintenance issues i.e. waited several weeks to get drain if laundry sink repaired which flooded floor every time doing a load of washing.

Need to be made accountable for falsely advertising with photos of properties not in their current state i.e. photos taken from RP Data from when property sold 10 years ago drove 300km round trip to view and didn’t even bother to get out of the car property was in such a poor state this has happened on numerical occasions 

Real Estate agents should be flexible with inspections a date and time provided in advertising normally only 15 minute window and always during business hours - bad luck if you can’t get time off work in most instances they refuse to make another suitable time to view"
Having the ability to say no to being kicked out under special circumstances. I had a phone call when I was in labor being told that they wanted to come over to take pictures because the owners are selling the house. 
"longer term arrangements (1 year to 10 year options)
automatic renewal on longer rental periods
no reason termination stopped or if allowed, the property owner pays all costs of moving
time frame for repairs and a oversight committee with ruling that have to be followed
the weeks that the property is inspected are rent free
development of a database of bad property owners etc
a framework that stops rent bidding
rent increases tie to the lessor of pay increases or cost of living
"
"Owners should pay water rates and tentents should only pay for excess usages. 

Realestate run properties should be checked for damages but not be ridiculed because of minor cleaning maintenance eg. Dust in window tracks, dust on fans etc. 

In my experience I’ve pay my two weeks in advance and yet still have to pay till date of leave. I do not understand how the Realestate’s do this, but they managed to make it appear that that rent is forfeited. 

Realestate’s should also follow through with repairs after owners approvals. I’ve been through situations that owner has approved and the property manager has not followed through with repairs. 

I’ve just read the next question and sometimes it’s not the renter or owner who are favoured but the Realestate’s. I will be putting owner but that is more accountable towards the realestate. The owners buy a home for investment reasons I understand this but the rates insurance loan etc should be owners responsibility not the tenets. 

There should also be something in place for ppl who want long term leases. So that if house sells the place they call home is not sold from underneath them. This make for a very limboed life which is extremely stressful for a renter. Also while selling a house the fact of inspections are incredibly inconvenient and stressful. "
Allow pets in more properties
"Tenant are treated with a complete lack of dignity and respect by property managers in Queensland. Every real estate agent we have ever rented with in Queensland has engaged in unprofessional and dis-honest conduct: entering the property without informing us (the tenants), allowing owners to perform work on the property without entry notices, creating false bills (water charges), employees of agency operating additional business within this business (ie bond cleaning) and falsing creating issues to produce additional income for their side business, agency and owner continually entering property so often (several times a month) so that it is impossible to tenants to peacefully live at the property. Tenancts have no rights in Queensland and all regulations favour the property manager/owner."
The Property Managers need to become more accountable. They need to be more helpful towards tenants as well as communicate better with landlords and in a more timely manner
Being able to have pets and change 3 monthly inspections 
Allowing pets to stay in properties 
"Maintenance requests. Weather or not they are approve and the time frame. 
Not being able to have all my family animals and being cut down to one. The others having to stay with family, as they won't allow them. "
Make it less difficult to attain a rental when you have pets
Less frequent routine inspections for tenants who have demonstrated reliable care of a property.
"Length of vacate notice periods.
Years ago it was 2 weeks notice to either party. Since then owner has to give 2 months and the tenant only 2 weeks. I’d like to see EQUAL notice periods again and think 1 month is reasonable for both parties. "
Honesty from both Real Estate Agents and Landlords.
Allow pets in rentals
"Decrease in 1form applications, increase in rentals allowing pets"
"As a renter, I found the rules and expectations to be fair.... However I didn't like the dynamic of renting, so decided to make the switch to home ownership after working hard for 5years. "
It is extremely difficult to rent with pets. There are almost no options available. Pets generally do much less damage than young children yet pet owners are discriminated against and families with young children are not. 
"More flexibility in adding pictures to walls/decorating.  One option may be to have lease extended, lower cost, agreements, similar to commercial lease agreements, in which it is possible to rent a ""shell"" and fit it out to suit the tenant's requirements, as long as it is returned to the original state at the end of the lease."
increased measures to deal with rogue tenants who cause obvious damage to a rental premises but any deny responsibility.
Longer lease agreements
"The standard of properties given to tenants
Longer lease choices with rent capped for low income families
More pet friendly properties with the real estate not dictating this 
"
"Improved communication between owner, real estate and tenant when dealing with maintenance issues. It can be difficult as a tenant to make concerns known or escalate issues without feeling like there could be consequences (lease termination, bad relationship)."
Real estate agents in Port Douglas don't work to satisfy tenant needs
Allowing the landlord more control over their property. 
"More legislation around who is allowed to be a property manager, particularly onsite managers who buy management rights. The current model lacks basically any regulation , complaints channels are not good enough and it’s open to corruption (onsite managers taking over proxy votes at body corporate meetings and controlling the flow of information to landlords) and bullying and harrassment of tenants AND might I add, owners as well where QCAT the OFT REIQ body corporate managers association, absolutely no one will / can do anything . It’s amazing these people can stroll in; take over everything to do with someone else’s property and bully threaten and harass tenants and owners. My partner was threatened to be bashed by the on-site manager for parking on a visitor parking spot. Police said it wa a body cooperate matter but they ran the body corporate. Body cooperate didn’t care. Then they served us with a breach notice and the next day a notice to leave without grounds.  No one did anything. QCAT did nothing. "
Being able to hang pictures 
That if u r good tenents that u would be allowed to have a longer lease with a lower rent price. 
make it more fair for tenants
"Having more places that allow pets, that are affordable too"
"Repairs done in a more timely manner. Repair requests logged and accessible online

Property Managers need to be accountable. I have had one exceptional property manager, the rest have been borderline incompetent and there are no represcussions 
"
"More legislation surrounding property managers. Bad ones seem to get no repercussions.  Also, there should be some sort of licensing around who can be a rental property owner as some people just see them as set and forget and do not maintain the property."
"Easier to have pets, harsher penalties on landlords and agents doing the wrong thing. "
More respect from real estate agents towards tenants. 
"It’s disgraceful that Councils like MBRC are allowed to charge higher rates to the owner (me), simply because the townhouse is rented out. On what planet is that fair? The impact on the Council’s service cost delivery is not higher just because I am not living in it myself. It’s just plain gouging and when I talked to the Councillor on this he had no answer. As a retiree I do not get back any tax relief as I don’t earn a living and the townhouse is paid off. So the excuse that you can claim the rates on your tax does not wash. Don’t allow differentiated rates based on whether a property is owner occupied or rented out. This would help to encourage more people to invest in rental properties."
"Need to allow pets. Also, there should be the option to take up to 3 years in a rental agreement, short-term renting agreements heavily favour landlords. Needs to be more done about real estate agents expecting places to be spotless when you move out - reasonable wear & tear will happen. "
"Being allowed to treat the rental property as a home by, for example:
Not having to obtain permission to keep pets
Not having to obtain permission to hang pictures on walls
Not having to submit to invasive conditions that agents impose for inspections (need a prescribed set of rules)
Reduced frequency of inspections (based on track record)
No photos during inspections (its an invasion of privacy)
Eliminating the practice of having fixed term leases after the initial fixed term expires
Removing the fear of reprisal by only allowing evictions for cause (or a set of special circumstances), not at the landlord's whim
"
The downright descrimination/racism/sexism of real estate agents these days. I am a professional and am treated well but I am abhored by the treatment of big families and those without jobs and of different skin colours!!!
How realestate agents treat tenants
Rental prices going up but the rental is deteriorating.
"If the owner is selling, I have the strangers coming through my home 3 weeks in every month for an open house, even if I am sick or home for the day on days off - I have to leave for that time."
"Cheaper rent, more flexibility in terms of owning pets or how we use property. "
"Timely responses from agents to repairs and also inspections every 6 months and not 3 months. Also, having agents who not the RTA regulations!!"
Stronger rules to deal with tenants that cause obvious damage to rental homes but deny responsibility for having caused it.
"I would love to be able to put up a few hooks for some artwork and a clock. Due to a severe dust allergy, I cannot have things sitting out on shelves, so it would be great to be able to hang some on the walls. My current place has absolutely zero hooks in the entire 3 bedroom apartment."
The frequency of routine inspections. They are intrusive and too often.
"Rent control, strict oversight "
When landlord is selling there should be a rent reduction and a cap on inspections. It is an invasion of privacy and inconvenience when you are paying rent to live in the property. Especially when you work and your Saturdays are taken up with people looking at the property.  
A “pets allowed on application” property did not accept our application for an elderly RSPCA cat saying they “did not want any pets on the property” despite it being a large part of us choosing that place. 
Helping landlords understand that a lot of new apartments go through a lot of wear and tear and that it’s not the tenanats responsibility to cover these costs. The cost is their’s alone and should be spotted and rectified with each inspection.
Make it easier to have pets
"Nothing at this stage, we just hope the rental agreement doesn't end in 4 years time.  "
Less ability for agents to charge people entire bond for wear and tear.
Agencies advertising rentals & they should be obliged to advise when property already under application
"The RTA generally has been a good experience for me. I think I've been fortunate though and have heard horror stories of people being kicked out/price hikes etc. But for me, renting has been pleasant and straightforward. "
"Increase the terms of leases, 6-12 months is ridiculous."
Being able to personalise a property by hanging up pictures/paintings
No issues. I have an excellent tenant
Pets being allowed. Being allowed to do your own carpet cleaning not having to pay a professional. Independent person do the end of lease inspection. 
"'- Better turn around times for repairs
- Mandatory safety screens for apartments (ventilation is terrible and we can't leave anything open as we're on the first floor
- Actually fixing up accessing energy retailers if you're on an embedded network
- Minimising inspections to once or twice per year
- Recourse if repairs aren't carried out in a timely manner"
"More responsibility needs to be put on tenants, we have been not paid and our place damaged costing thousands of dollars to repair and little of no come back.

The bond is no where sufficient to cover repairs and missed rents.

Landlords need to be able to manage their property, and put rules in place, if the tenant does not want to rent by those rules then it should be free market and they can look elsewhere.
"
"as a landlord I wish to see that insurance covers the tenants on periodical lease as well as normal leases to have more protection for the owners.

I also had bad experiences of tents left far greater damage than the bond money can cover, which cost me both much money and time to repair plus lost rent (8 months to repair)"
"Less restrictions on pets/not so much hate on pets.
Or
Less strict cleaning requirements. (I mean cleaning window tracks? Door tracks? Washing carports?! C'mon..)"
Property Managers having a standard SLA to respond to tenants. My current landlord is fantastic at getting things done but the property managers change so often and they often take weeks to respond. 
"As a Landlord for over 40 years, i keep my rents affordable for couples & families & look after them & the property. My experience is that a lot of agents are the problem, i have sacked 2 of them over the years for incompetence, they are just money hungry, take on too many properties as well as properties that are not up to standard with greedy landlords."
Price for what you get and  some landlords are just plain rude to renters 
Being easier to find a property that accepts pets and children. 
Improved access to maintenance services
"One time we had a really creepy property owner who would come in whenever he liked, and the real estate agents could only help us so much because they were representing him. So I think if there were a way to support tenants who have to leave quickly that would be good, or even a way of registering having some sort of judicial punishment for landlords who act like that. "
better maintenance of property
"more availability (especially pet friendly), more affordable, less restrictions regarding pictures etc."
"I agree the owner has the right to sell their property, but think that it's unfair to do so, only say when the tennant is 6 months or so into a 12 months lease agreement. The tennant no longer has  any peaceful enjoyment of the property, with sales agents and prospective buyers traipsing in and out. Some agents can be very  agressive about  when they want to bring people in when it suits them and not the tennant. Also not always providing the entry notice to tennants."
GOOD quality properties
Things to be fixed within 7days and not have to wait 2 years and for rent to be at the same price every year and not increase.
More controls over agents duty on behalf of property owner
Respect for my home from property managers who were snippy and aggressive. Ability to negotiate through temporary difficult one when my husband died instead of being evicted
Allow small pets
To be able to talk to the owner more often 
"Agencies rarely accept self cleaning with fairness of general wear and tear. they really attack the bond held in the maximum way
"
I pay good money to rent i dont expect the world but i make this place like my own i think landlords should come to the party and reward good tenants.
"make real estates and landlords responsible for not maintaining their homes. make them liable for mould infected homes, make them responsible for furniture and belongings that are ruined by mould. placing the responsibility on the tenant to have insurance is unreasonable. Make them liable for medical expenses and illnesses that tenants suffer due to a lack of maintenance and mould infestation"
Laws surrounding pets - it was very hard to find a pet-friendly place to live.
"Making it cheaper and less paperwork when doing applications. Make it easier so get out of a contract by making applications 
Every 6mths for every 1yr. "
A major overhaul of the tenancy laws.
"Affordability
House maintenance "
"MAKE LEGISLATION MORE TRANSPARENT AND EASY TO FIND (include important points in the agreement for everyone to see). 

It can be difficult to navigate the legislation that governs renting in QLD. For example. Acts Interpretation Act comes into play here but there is no information about this on the RTA website for agents or tenants. 

Additionally, technical rules like (tenancies not being allowed to end on Sundays) is governed by this act (and not mentioned in tenancy agreements or the RTA websites). Many agents don't even know this fact until they come up against an issue. I think that information should be made more readily available instead of being hidden behind tricky legislation that can trip parties up. This would avoid many trips to QCAT. 

SUGGEST - a line in the standard tenancy agreement to say that the if the end date is a SUNDAY or PUBLIC HOLIDAY then the tenant is not required to vacate until midnight on the next business day. "
Get rid of the 'No Pets Allowed' point on almost 90% of advertised rental properties.
Real estate property management ethics
"Some real estate agents are not good communicators, they can be the weak link be tenant and landlord."
Less frequent property inspections
The inbalanaceof power that realestate agencies constantly take advantage of
Being able to make it more of a home instead of a lot of constrictions
"The RTA customer service line is not enough, and need to wait long time to get to someone."
"End to the garbage that you must have a fixed term lease to rent. Ie existing REIQ standard lease agreement provides for a month-to-month rental, however every place I have rented has demanded a fixed term lease and refused to allow an extension of the original lease on a month-to-month basis."
"The real estate didn't care at all about what we needed as tenants and instead only cared about keeping the owner happy. They frequently forgot, misplaced, or spent ages getting paperwork fixed. I constantly felt I was doing their job for them and I felt like I got punished or blacklisted everytime I made a fuss about paperwork not being correct. "
"the way you are treated by real estate  as a tenant, more respect, more privacy, more security"
"Make water fee payable like rent. If water usage fee is not paid on time, it will deemed to be as rent is not paid on time. "
Clarifying a lot of grey areas
"Less invasion of privacy for tenants with a good rental history ie. rent payed on time, proven to look after rental property"
Improve time taken for repairs/maintenance.
"Greater protection for tenants- whilst we were renting every 6 maths we got a request for the owner to access the property for ‘maintenance’ even when there were no requests for maintenance. This was in addition to routine inspections. It’s difficult to challenge the request when you are in a vulnerable position (on a periodic lease). Also, when we packing at the end of the lease we had a request for people to access the house for ‘maintenance’ which was to do improvement on the property for the next tenants. Despite the fact that this created a significant inconvenience (being unable to access parts of the house for the day and electricity supply being cut off for the work) we were told it had to occur. "
Clearer expectations of landlords and agents. Ability for greater transparency between landlord and agent communication/complaints about tenants. 
Pets allowed at more properties
For there to be more options for renters to have pets on the property. Instead of 3 monthly house inspections should be min 6 months. 
"The ability to make basic changes without worrying about losing our bond (e.g. hang a picture on the wall, replace a shower head, change a light fitting etc. "
More control in deciding what is included in the lease agreement
Getting left out of pocket by tenants who fall behind in their rent and then leave the property 
The owner should have the power to control their investment property. 
Having rent at a fixed amount for a set period of time. Eg. Lock in a set amount of rent for a period of 5years. 
"My partner got blacklisted, He lived with his girlfriend of 4 years and bestfriend in a joint tenancy. They cheated together and ran away. My partner was an apprentice earning $400 per week, he couldnt afford $300 by himself. Now we cant get a rental. I am studying to become a doctor and cant attend university at the moment because we had to move away. Its ruining my life. "
More rentals allowing pets
"Having more rights within the home. For example, being able to put up picture frames with hooks. "
More secure long term rentals
Cheaper rent to enable families to save for a deposit to buy own property 
"Everything On the list needs improvement: Invasive inspections every 3 (!) months, no pets allowed, no choice of energy supplier thus no savings possible, no gardening/planting, hooks etc etc etc. "
"Being more strict on tenants and agents that abuse the system. As a rental property owner we have been on the Ned of the house being trashed and not reviveing a cent to do repairs. The tenant was told no pets yet the agent allowed a registered cat Breeder to set up shop in our property, the only reason we found out their were cats every where on the property including inside the house was due to the fact she complained the laundry drainage was backing up so we got a registered plumber out ( a family member ) out to investigate and discovered cats every where the drains had backed up from HER cleaning kitty litter down them, the house and under the house ( high set property) stunk of cat urine & faeces that couldn’t be removed. We had renovated the property 12mths prior and a single shift work male lived in the house for 6 mths before this tenant from hell so the house was basically a place for him to sleep so everything was perfect still when he moved out, The not even 12mth old carpets and polished hardwood floor boards upstairs upstairs where destroyed from cat urine & faeces not to mention them scratching at it, the floor boards were covered in scratches from the cats and nail polish from her children spilling every where, walls had scratch marks on them too from the the cats, the also put staples and thump tacks every where in walls through out the house. We didn’t get any of the bond back and it took as a month to get the house cleaned up to even be able to put the place on the market, we had had the property for over 6yrs as a rental with nearly 5.5yrs with 1 family as tenants and never had issues until a tenant with pets. I never wanted to buy another rental property again due to agents and tenants not caring about our investment that we worked out backsides off to pay for. "
"More respect for tenants (more time between inspections - real estates always jump on the minimum time frame of 3 monthly inspections, despite a tenant having lived in a place for years)."
"More cheaper housing
Get rid of the 1form"
Animals should be allowed inside all properties. 
Make it easier to rent having dogs
Better communication from real estate
"Fewer inspections, longer term rental agreements "
"To have a clear definition of ""Fair wear and tear"""
"24 hour notice for entry when the house is for sale. I would like to see this extended to 72 hours. 
"
Allow pets within council regulations.
"Time frames for landlords to fix routine repairs. 
"
Pets should be allowed including fenced yards
"No restrictions To pets. 

Most well trained pets are much cleaner and not destructive as some children"
Making it harder for tenants to up and leave a property before the tenancy expiry period and leave the landlord in debt. 
Overall renting is too costly.
Rents need to be cheaper for 1-person households.
Renters have too many rights compared to landlords
"I'm answering with my severely disabled son in mind, who is currently renting and had so much difficulty in finding accessible open market housing, to be able to leave home and live independently at 29yrs old. There are few properties which are accessible and they didn't find landlords/realties amenable to modifications like taking out a shower screen to be replaced if they ever left. The property owners, despite there being a ramp to access the units, were not obliged to offer their rental to applicants with a disability so they chose the safest economic applications.  This government and the NDIA disappoint greatly with the 2017-20 Housing strategy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCLoNwVJA-0  With the NDIS, although my son pre-dated the scheme in Cairns, there will be thousands of PWD who need accessible housing. The NDIA have not impressed this upon the Qld Govt, when scanning this document the only reference to PWD is in the grandiose gesture of making the online IT portal accessible. There is mention of minority groups like victims of violence and indigenous people being catered for, but no actual mention of the need for more rental properties to be accessible or for more Specialist Disability Accommodation to be built.  Not every PWD has severe/high needs and many will want to live in regular communities that are not defined as ""special"" but how can they if there is a shortage?  This government needs to offer incentives for Landlords to not only modify their dwellings (often with a ramp and a roll-in shower) but to actually rent their property to a PWD.  I believe that this will be good for the entire population as they age. It will add value to the property and it will encourage owners to prioritize PWD instead of marginalizing them, if they have adequate access. Not everyone wants to live in a purpose  built disability institution or group home and this is in fact the most expensive solution, costing many millions to serve a handful of PWD and usually located on the fringes of society making access to the community and transport problematic.  The most cost effective way to solve the housing shortage is to modify existing properties in the heart of communities with good access and less travel and community support problems."
The ability to live in the house instead of trying to keep it as a display home. We understand it’s your investment property and some tenants can do the wrong thing but we shouldn’t all be tarnished under the same brush.
Landlords having to fix a problem within a certain time frame. Properties must be lockable to minimum insurance standards. More pet friendly properties. To be able to hang a picture. 
THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PROPER INSPECTION THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE AT AN EXIT LEVEL OF INSPECTION
Earlier this year I just re-signed a lease. Within a few weeks the house was put on the market. I do not feel landlords should have the right to do this early in a lease. Rules that are fair to renters need to be put in place. It should not be up to renters to keep a house meticulously tidy for numerous prospective buyers to wander through. 
More pet friendly property
Better communication and follow through with rental agents
"More rights for tenants

Yearly check ups on real estates and their practice "
To make my rental feel like a 'home'. 
Stricter penalties for tenants who leave a property owing money to the landlord. Being able to take a higher Bond amount may be one solution.
It's not easy to remove bad tenants. By the time you go through the process a lot of damage can be done. Easier removal of bad tenants would  be good.
"Over-priced, lack of options and uncertainty of future"
Better system when dealing with bad Tenants
"i wish my 2 dogs were able to live inside my home with me, especially when one has a medical condition. The area we live in is very hot in summer and very cold in winter. I also dislike how often the inspections get done and the rules the agent put in place for these inspections ie: nobody is to be sleeping (what about shift workers?), all dogs must be tied up (what if you work all day and cant get home to release them after the inspection), house must immaculate and cleaned within its life (i thought inspections was to make sure no damage was being done?) having to pay water bills when we are no longer in a drought. When we first started renting many years ago we only had to pay excess water charges now its for all our use"
"That all properties assumed to allow outside pets at the minimum and leave it to the tennant to decide if place is suitable (ie fenced etc) for their animals. We already have to comply with local council rules regarding animals why should we also have to ask permission from people who do not live at the address.
Using rental friendly command type hooks etc for hanging pictures and being able to modify or create gardens (unless its some kind of expensive landscaping feature thats in place)"
Being treated better by real estate agents
Introduce a Longer term lease for stability
requiring estate agents to have a variety of payment methods. I was required to pay the bond in cash and then use a payment agent (with extra fees) to pay the rent. I now send my rent electronically directly to the3 agent. Saving the fee with each rental payment.
"Have water bills separate from the sewerage bill and be able to be sent straight to the renter. Renters responsibility to connect water like with phone , electricity and internet. This eliminates real estate issues with both remnants and owners ."
"Acceptance of small animals as a requirement and part of peoples lives, particularly for aging single people.  Encouragement for landlords to undertake work to install power, water and saving and economising measures. Ability to put pictures up and make the house a home."
Have a Land lord provide water to the house so I didnt have to carry buckets of water on crutches just to flush the toilet or have a bath.
We need to be able to make the houses we live in to feel like our homes. Restrictions in place can make that impossible. 
"Increase property’s with pets. 
I have 2 cats and I want a dog
When we pay over $450 a week to live in someone else’s home you want the freedom to have as many pets as you want that allows the renting house to feel like a home "
"Better communication, & being more open to pet owners."
More scope to make changes to house or garden
To be able to live in the house without penalty. As long as the tenant is willing to remove/fix any damages before moving out. Installing picture hooks for example or being able to have pets (even if it means a pet bond is introduced). 
Fairer rules for good tenants
Landlords who care. More pet friendly houses 
"Timely responses to requests for maintenance from our Property Manager, and less intrusion/abrasiveness from the same."
"I'd like a simpler way to access my rental ledger & receipts, maintenance requests, correspondence, lease, entry notices, breaches, etc. from my agency/landlord/organisation in one place, online, to make sure everything is documented correctly & nothing is overlooked by them or me."
"More stability. When I like where I am renting I don't want to be forced out so easily. All landlords need to do is SAY they plan to sell and you have to be out, but no one makes them actually do it. They can put it back up for rent as soon as your out. "
Longer rental terms 
"Give tenants more rights.
Also, if a property is deemed unliveable there should be no need to obtain an agreement from the owner to end the tenancy."
"If equality was implemented through the service of the property manager then all landlords, real estate agencies and tenants would be satisfied. Rather than just the landlords and agents. Good tenants are valuable tenants. To maintain a health ongoing income is ideal for all parties and the income in rental properties will always come from the tenant. So tenants should be equally treated as what the landlords are treated."
Non-passive aggressive real estate agents and real estate agents that actually maintain responsibility for one house for the duration of the tenant's lease (have had over 5 agents throughout the course of one year).
More than one thing 1. Have things fixed on the premises in a reasonable amount of time (it took 13 years for the last landlord and real estate to fix the front stairs & it took them 12 months to fix the oven -  I had to buy an electric oven to use in the meantime!) 2. Be able to have my pets in a rental property 3. Be able to hang some of my paintings on the wall.
"Agents taking more responsibility and offer better customer service to tenants, not just the landlord."
Stop Real estate from bullying  tenants 
if expected to maintain outdoors by watering gardens and lawns this should be exempt from having to pay excess water charges.  
Increase bond to cover potential damage 
"more help with getting things fixed around the properties.
landlords do not want to part with there money for repairs but if behind in rent !!!"
I’m a property owner and I have not yet rented out my property
All rental properties should have solar installed.
"I moved from victoria and it is annoying that I have to keep singing leases and no landlord seems to allow you to go month to month after the end of your lease. Even if you have been there for two years you have to keep committing to a minimum 6 months or they threaten to increase the rent. I have never paid late, never not got my bond back and have excellent references. I don't understand why we can't just go month to month and continue to live in a property after the initial term expires."
Make it easier for tenants with pets
Have clear timeframes for maintenance issues to be resolved
The fact that it's so hard even with good references. There are so many people at a 10 minute viewing and you're pushed through so fast.  We were told that if we submit multiple applications we may be made to pay rent until the property was rented again if we didn't take it once approved.  Approval takes at least 10 days to come through sometimes.
"Less inspections, reward for looking after property."
Lower renting prices 
Tenants that break agreements are immediately fined a percentage of the monthly rent.
owners to take more reponsibility for property maintenance
"Bond to be able to be transferred from one property to another, to allow for ease of relocation to different properties."
Set better professional standards for registered property managers
"Affordable renting at decent properties. 
"
Have owners of the property be more accountable for when improvements have to be made. It can take months or weeks for things to be done and sometimes you are scared to raise issues because there are plenty of other people willing to take your place. 
"More properties allow pets, landlords have to fix maintenance within a shorter timeframe. "
"Allow pets. 
Agent following rules regarding access 
Repairs in a timely manner 
Not withholding total bond over a 70cent plug"
"Allowing pets, allowing to put up decorations on walls as long as they are patched up after "
"I'd like to see a basic ""Code of Conduct"", that is standardised, binding and covers all parties to a tenancy- Tenants, landlords & agents, in Qld. Covering topics like  bonds, commencement inspections, periodic inspections,repairs, minimum allowable improvements by tenants, (ie. painting, changing minor fixtures, all subject to landlord approval), keeping of pets within reason,(ie, not a pigeon racing stable, or home for stray animals)."
Transfer bond between properties
I would love to be able to have my cat 
Owners having to put in air conditioning in qld properties.
Maintenance issues being rectified in a timely fashion 
More communication between property management 
"Exclude african blacks and muslim invaders claiming to be ""asylum seekers"" from public or other renting schemes. They want to come to Australia? Let them bring enough cash to support themselves fully without relying on Centrelink benefits. Limit public housing to decent Australians of non-african or muslim backgrounds. That way, the current lengthy waiting lists will be reduced."
"Make it easier to remedy breaches especially rental payment breaches.  The current system is not bad and probably works in most cases, but I have experience of a tenant repeatedly not paying rent on time.  Following the requirements of the breach process can get very frustrating and time consuming when there are these ""serial breaches""."
Have solar panels be mandatory.
"Better treatment from property managers and agencies after signing a lease and moving in. Many agents we know have inspected outside their allotted hours, not left forwarding contacts for emergencies after leaving the company and have made it very difficult to get out bond back after moving out."
Communication between rentwr and landlord. I understand why they use real estate offices as managers but real estates take time and often dont report things to owners so that they look good. There should be a way to escalate issues directly through the RTA if required.
Rental insurance needs to be a viable and affordable option for renters as any damages can destroy their pocket without protection.
Greater freedoms for renters
"Properties should be subjected to independent building inspections by qualified building inspector every 5 years to ensure properties are safe and up to standard ie pergola not rotting, flooding, mould, etc.  A property cannot be rented if not safe and up to standard."
Larger bonds to cover damage.
More protection for owners from delinquent tenants.
The price of rent and the illegal practices real estates carry out despite the laws if you rent and require maintenance ledgers are changed ( have had this happen first hand and almost evicted due to this however I had proof ) the RTA however despite the laws are in the agents favour always 
Hanging frames/photos to make it more homely. Maintenance needs to be much quicker as does organising NBN for the internet. All rentals should be pet friendly (I have moved interstate and a pet is therapy for me for home sickness).
More respect by the agent for renters in general
Less invasive inspections when having an exceptional renting history. Do they really need to look in the oven when it’s not an exit inspection? 
Process for dealing with a Tenant who is in Arrears or who damages property.
Have more homes pet friendly and lower rent
"Being allowed to have pets such as cats, birds etc. "
"The term condition of renting house need to meet requirements of tenants, stabdard clean room maintaining service. Eg: clean toilet, and kitchen. The renting fee should be lower and affordable. "
Less routine inspections without pictures being taken and only taken for maintenance I think this a rule at the moment but property managers don’t Nine this rule and take them anyway and don’t care about the tenant 
"Queensland has strict smoking laws, however there are no laws to protect tenants and their families from inhaling secondhand smoke from tenants in other houses. This is especially an issue in units and townhouses where tenancies are in such close proximity to each other. Stricter laws should be enforced to ensure all tenants can have quiet enjoyment of their tenancy without risking their health from cigarette smoke inhalation."
The RTA - information is inconsistent and under staffed
"Being able to treat the house as if our own, IE: putting pictures up, security screens, ceiling fan in main bedroom"
I dont trust my property manager has our best interests in mind and is more interested in the property owner
As a landlord. Extensive repairs and cleaning when tenants move out of the houses. Also large loses due to tenants having dogs inside the home when it says in leases NO PETS.
"When looking for a rental house we had to give away our dog that we had for my grandson when his mother (my daughter) was very ill and passed away, they did not allow even small dogs."
Make real estate agents accountable for their actions
More available /affordable places for mature aged working people with no children. 1 bedroom units.
Realestate agents need to be held more accountable for repairs and safety of the houses they manage and the safety of their renters.
"The attitude of property managers towards renters. They make you feel like an untrustworthy, second class citizen."
Make it that water is billed to the tenant just like electricity is. This would allow me to save on rent and water rather than pay an assumed amount of water use even though I use much less.
Allowing tenants to keep pets and also to allow tenants to do minor changes to the home such as window mounted airconditioners and possibly repainting indoors without needing to apply.
More opportunity for longer term leases 2 years+
The owner to fix things. All houses accept dogs there my children even though they are huge dogs. Hang things on the walls without fear of having bond taken. If oven is old they should have to replace it at least every 10 years min. If in first year of perfect rental inspections should be than every 6 months or more. 
"Property managers need to be more reliable and sensible (e.g. actually turn up for inspections, send a copy of the bill when requesting money for bills, do more to manage poor tenants)"
Being able to put things on the walls and make minor changes 
Put a cap on what rent amounts and rent rises can be applied to properties
Owners not allowing pets. Agents trying everything they can to take your bond only for you to fight it because it wasn’t your fault or it is wear and tear. 
Stricter laws on construction and letting tennats move in before QBCC verification of standards 
Tenants should eb allowed ton havev pets but there should be regulatiosn in the By laws about the owners responsibility of picking up dog and cat poo abd uncessant barking of a dog.
Quality of rental agencies (real estate agents) - they let the process down because they poorly fund their rental departments.
"Real estate agents attitudes towards tenants unfair requests and treating clients poorly, as a tenant we cannot argue they stop renting to you, they are only two real estates and there reputation is appalling, RTA  is ok but the real estate just get angry for going to them and then will not rent to you, i ma moving away to get away from them,i find every real estate you go to they are rude and demanding.  really disappointing i have never been behind in rent or wrecked a house "
"Landlord will use any excuse to blame Tennant's for damage. ""Wear and tear"" is too vague of a terminology that generates too many arguments between landlords, real-estate agents and Tennants.

We need clearer rules and better rights to get 
important damages fixed instead of ignored."
Improve access to properties for pet owners. 
"we have had some very bad experiences with agents and owners who refuse to carry out maintenance at times, to the extent that at the end of the agreement period we really had no choice but to vacate and find a new property to rent"
"If a tenant is in a property for a certain amount of years (e.g 10 years) the owner needs to  replace floor coverings in the house, and other renovations that need doing wiht in a time frame if tennant as maintained home."
"If you are a new migrant seeking to rent, it cant be very frustrating. The system of renting must be friendly to new migrant."
The real estate agents treat you like a criminal and a second class citizen
Allowing renters to have pets 
"Allow tenants to find a maintenance person for simple repair fixes (leaky taps, non working lights, door handle etc) and have them do the fix job, then have amount off rent or paid for by landlords."
"Pets allowed at all properties with appropriate fencing, etc. "
Bond transfers between properties.  Greater flexibility 
Beung able to have a pet and hang pictures on the walls 
"Allow pets in more rental properties. I have a dog, would love to have another, but it was incredibly hard to find properties that allow pets which also suit my budget and needs. All of the pet owners I know are responsible people who care deeply about their animals. I know with myself, any (unlikely) mess or damage to property as a result of my pet would be cleaned and returned to a prior state. 
It is proven that pets increase people’s hapiness and have a positive impact on wellbeing, and people who rent often cannot get a pet, which is a massive shame.
Ensuring that more rental properties allow pets would also ease the problem of rehoming and/or dumping of pets when people move and cannot take them with them."
The power of renters say with the body corporate
Equalise rights of owners & renters. Notice of 2 months for owners as opposed to 2 weeks for renters to terminate occupancy.
"The level of power and lack of independence real esatate agents have to control rental conditions, set terms and withhold bond money "
A limit on the dollar amount and regularity of rental increases.
More experienced landlords with proper knowledge of the rental laws.. more pet friendly properties 
Nothing aside from wishing the legislation was not so grey and non-committal. 
Allow dogs. Better property managers. 
"Getting rid of the 2 week inspections and make it automatic 3 monthly inspections only.
John Ahurn real estate have written signs saying that people need to go and pay rents and everything else this real estate demanding only money order payments only.
Also this real estate has also filled out there entire notice corectly and folse and misleading so that they can get every ones bonds. 
This is so terrible."
"Longer lease times, more security"
Extend the length of the lease 
"Lawns and gardens laws to be more defined within the act. I believe that when a tenant rents a property they rent the whole property and should be expected to maintain the lawns and gardens eg not letting grass turn into a lawn full of weeds and expect a landlord to then pay for either re-turfing or spraying of the lawn because this is seen as extra required to the premises, yet this has been caused due to not being looked after"
Allow us to have appropriate pets
"Make the process for pet owners smoth. My wife and I have excellent references but when it comes to rent with our dog, several times we either been rejected or delayed. Last time that we moved it took us over 2 months to find a property. "
Not being treated like scum of the earth.  Not having owners come and inspect and expect no living to be occurring.
Being allowed pets in more places
The bond repayment process. Change of tenancy management was too easy without previous contract being reviewed and updated to suit how the house was previously received.
"More thorough maintenance checks after tenants vacate to ensure all fittings, fixtures & appliances are working and aren't too old / dated.
Decent fencing on all sides of property & side fencing
Minimal to no carpet where possible, as it is less expensive to repair and maintain for both landlords & tenants."
"We moved here from SA and it was quite difficult finding a home as most agents want you to view the property which obviously was quite difficult. 
"
The amount of control property managers have over your bond. It seems a blown light globe can warrant a sizeable chunk of your bond to be confiscated. 
Protections for when some of the tenants need to leave/join mid lease (eg. In a sharehouse situation) - in the past a property manager refused to assess/allow anyone to join the lease and tried to evict us when one of the other housemates left even though the remaining tenants had been meeting all of our requirements and taking good care of the property. So more security for tenants in being able to remove/add people to the lease (provided the new prospective tenant/s pass the real estates assessment and go through all of the required processes). Also allowing pets unless there is a really valid reason not to 
"Cheaper rentals, more rentals available for victims of domestic violence, more rentals allowing pets, more rentals supporting families with children with special needs"
"Regarding 3 mthly inspections where the Property Manager takes photos of inside the House and Outside,this includes furniture , To put on their File and send to the Owner, Graden and Tree's, it is usually cut lawns and weed,keep tidy, Trees that are over hanging the roof etc are meant to be maintained by the Property Manager/Owner, Our Tree's are well over the roof of the House and after an inspection we mentioend this and were told the Owner does not have to do it, We are meant to prune back branches....where we can reach. The Rental inspections invade your privacy with the takeing of photos, i had one Property manager walk into a bedroom where a Family member was sick in bed,i told ehr she had just got out of Hopsital,she still walked into the bedroom . I have had them walk into a walk in robe...when they are not meant to,Also enter a walk in Pantry,they are not meant to do that either, Pull back blinds to check windows, It is now not only to see if the Property is not damaged but it is clean also,to their standard obviously, For $550 per wk rent we have decided not to resign our Lease when it is due,"
"Stricter laws and random audits on the condition some properties are left in.

"
"Faster resolution of issues/property damage, when required."
Long term lease options. I.e 5-10 years
more flexibility oppotunities to make you feel at home 
"Improved law ensuring that property owners conduct repairs and periodic maintenance in a timely manner, do not compromise the health of tenants, false and frivolous bond claims are penalised, permit tenants to have a pet"
ensure that the landlord would fix things when they should
"Rental agent attitude towards tenants. 
"
Complete rental agreement 
The hardest part is that we’ve copped some really dodgy landlords that we’ve had to take to QCAT to get our bond back. In contrast we’ve had 2 amazing landlords and property managers that maintained the property and couldn’t do enough for us both during the tenancy and at entry/exit.
The agent's over-keenness to make me lose some bond even though I had improved the property (with consent) - I put in a garden; so she got me for not vacuuming the sliding window recesses. She also tried to charge me for not dry-cleaning curtains even though I had told her I took them down because they were torn and faded!
The price of renting on the Sunshine Coast compared to other places is very high and makes it hard to rent.
When notify the Property Manager about any problems they should respond and should get the problem solved straight away. Tell the Tennant that someone is coming to have alook. Not leave them in the dark
I feel the legislation is becoming more and more one sides in the tenants favour. I have been a PM for 10 years and always ensure my owners do the right thing but continue to see them on the losing end of the scale. I would like to see owners keep the right to evict a tenant without grounds. I would also like to the see the time frame for this taken down to 30 days notice as two months when the bond is only 4 weeks is a joke. 
Better communication between all parties.
"More accountability for renters to maintain property to the standard they first received it in.
More accountability to landlords to complete maintenance in timely manner."
Reduced bond and more leniency on pets
Lower rent for people on a pension... or more help with paying rent..
Landlords not being able to claim part of the bond and then requiring tenants to fight for the money back
So far my experience renting has been positive. Only issues related to change over of rental company and their miscommunication issues between one another and I had to prove I was up to date with rent was was frustrating.
One item of concern is smoking. If you go to a commercial business there are regulations regarding smoking. However in unit complexes smokers can smoke in outdoor areas which can cause smoke to enter other units. Lack of regulation can affect neighbours health.
More freedom to actually make it a home.
More recognition of wear and tear
Six monthly routine inspections
At the moment laws etc are more favourable towards renter's and if are made to penalise investor's/Landlords more just doesn't add up. Less investment higher prices maybe there should be a question would renters pay higher rents for the convenience to be able to renovate and have as many pets as they would.
rental prices are going through the roof I am not able to apply for public housing 
"I have had no issues with the rules and regulations of renting, however I have multiple encounters with the agents themselves who completely disregard the rules and take advantage of tenants who are unfamiliar with the way everything works in the renting world."
Availability of good quality accommodation that is affordable at the same time.
"Tenants are often at the mercy of the agent/owner with many of the laws not favouring the tenant, which makes it difficult to get traction, even to achieve/maintain a minimum standard of living. "
"I was in a private rental. I moved in thinking, I would have the same experience I have had in non private rentals! I was very wrong. The house was FULL of grade 3 mould- only I didn’t know that; I until myself and my kids got sick (and through self education!)
My insurance doesn’t cover the $10000 worth of items that had to be thrown out! My landlord advised me CONSTANTLY that my neighbors told her various things (I never felt safe/private in my “own” home 2months after moving in)! My landlord gave very little notice to when she was bringing trades/looking at the property- the worst was 10am on a Sunday! However I was naive as I didn’t realise this was against “rental rights “ until I again educated myself!
I was told a lot of the things I wanted fixed were unreasonable/silly”
"
Faster real estate agent actions on both fronts.
"Pets, picture hooks, affordability, pest control"
"Issues fixed when they occur. Usually issues, even large ones, are ignored. Only remedy is to move according to RTA.
Long-term tenancies too. "
"If a landlords financial position changes and they need to sell within a lease period, mediation between tenant and landlord should be recommended rather than the tenant having all the power to stay if they want to "
"Allow renters with pets, over 80%of people these days have pets and yet renters are continually denied housing because of this!
I’m paying $500 a week rent simply because I didn’t want to lie about having a dog which I could’ve quite easily have done, the bulk of my wage goes on rent so I’m still technically living below the poverty line!"
"I'd like to not be treated like a second class citizen for being a renter. 
I'd like the option of a longer lease e.g 2-3 years at least. "
Ability to hang pictures on walls
Better transparency of tenant screening and availability of malicious tenants
"Property owner being more open to changing some aspects of the property. And the cost, obviously, sure all tenants would like cheaper rent."
All tenants be allowed to have a pet and all places allowed to be pet friendly. 
Price and availability of pet friendly properties
Easier process to remove tenants that don't pay their rent
Better transparency from rental real estate agents
"Real estate agents keeping to their word, they sometimes think they are god. In the past the owners of the house have been amazing it’s the real estate that causes the dramas.  On inspection day death in family asked if we could move days they said no, told them family over organising funeral arrangements they said that’s fine, inspection no dramas, next inspection (I have to take time off work as I have dogs .. so either I be home or dogs have to be offsite for inspections ... so I took time off work said I would start late, waited a hour after allocated time they said can’t do it today doing it tomorrow cause staff off sick, I said I can’t have tomorrow morning off cause I had today off and they said make sure dogs off premises if your not home ... no reaching agreement .. "
Reduced rent and more flexibility with changing the house.
Not having to remind agents or contact the RTA before agents address minor issues properly (eg. things that need to be repaired).
Better rights for tenants
Power of real estate agents with regards to renters reputation
When replacing equipment in a rental property (eg. ovens) the owners should have to replace like for life. I rented a place largely because of the high quality (but older) oven as I love to cook. Unfortunately 3 months into my tenancy the oven broke down. The owner replaced it with the cheapest oven on the market. I feel ripped off because I agreed to rent the property believing it had good quality cookware. I am now forced to wait to the end of the lease and suffer the expense of moving into a place that has what I thought I was paying for here.
"Would like to be able to hang family pictures without getting permission, not go overboard but a couple in each room."
Offer more low cost apartments in high demand suburbs 
Affordable stand-alone family homes close to good schooling and transport options.
Owners cant raise rent when you ask for things to be fixed on the property 
"When you are a good tenant & the property is in good condition & obviously being looked after it would be nice if the agent reduced the n# of inspections. Of course they won't because they charge the owners for each inspection they do. Also I really hate the new practice of taking videos in every room during an inspection. There needs to be strict guidelines around this. How they are kept, who gets to see them. Otherwise video of my possessions could be on someones thumb drive for anyone to pick up."
Better pet laws and ability to make small changes to property 
If a long term tenant either keep rent price the same or reward tenant by reducing rent especially if tenants have taken it ilupon them selves to maintain and improve gardens. 
That landlords/agents come when they say are they are and fix broken stuff on time
The right to obtain or bring your pet with you when occupying s rental 
Keep the pets out of rental properties
I am not renting but someone is renting my property. I think the laws are already adequate enough but more bond money to be taken to recover damages when vacated.
Landlords who will actually carry out repairs in a timely manner 
Longer more certain leases. 
"Remove ability for landlords to evict on short notice with ""no reason / notice given"".

Asking to have a leaking toilet that's spewing water fixed should not result in the landlord being able to conveniently evict you the next day with ""no reason/notice given"" because they want to find someone else who won't bring the issue up.

I feel that tennants should have 3 things with rentals; peace, privacy and stability. Peace and quiet, privacy from prying landlords (this especially applies to landlords residing on the same block of land but not the same building. They should not be 'popping down to just have a look' every now and then) and stability (see aforementioned point at top.)."
Need more pet friendly accommodation 
"make tenants more accountable , I have rental property in western Qld and the situation with damage and maintenance is to the point even the aboriginal housing is being sold off as they can no longer afford the costs ."
I think that there needs to be more freedom for tenants to actually use the house as their own.
"The unfairness between rooming and rental legislation.

Rooming is less fair than rental despite roomers often being more vulnerable."
"I have lived in and currently live in high-density buildings and find the pressure Building Managers out on renters to decide whether or not they are vacating unreasonable. I am asked to provide 8 weeks or more notice on whether I am going to stay or vacate at the end of my lease and although the law says only a minimum of two weeks notice is required, Building Managers threaten to begin looking for a new tenant if you do not comply with the 8 weeks notice period. I find this frustrating because new buildings typically aren’t interested in your application and in some cases even allowing you to inspect unless you are 2-4 weeks from a move-in date and this puts you in a difficult situation because you are being asked to decide whether or not you’re vacating before you are even sure you have a suitable place to go. Especially with competition in Brisbane with new buildings hitting the skyline all the time as a renter I like to explore my options for better value and lifestyle elsewhere before renewing a lease."
More rights as a landlord to keep property safe from bad tenants 
"Allow tenants to have pets, 
Make landlords justify rent increases."
More efficient maintenance carried out on old houses by landlords. 
"As an owner, I am concerned about new pet laws."
I'd love to be able to have a pet. Anything really. I'd like a dog but the owner won't allow it
have some sort of process where landlords have to justify rent increases esp in cases in which matinence has gone ignored/neglected.
Allowing landlords easier access to their rental properties by direct contact with tenants.
Requirements from Landlords for maintenance 
"For property owners to be able to remove tenants who fail to pay rent, maintain and take care of the property more easily without fear of incurring enormous costs and expense."
"Allowing Pets! I had to leave mine behind which is not only sad for me but them as well... most animals in shelters are over flowing due to this, I see it from both angles but there are A LOT of responsible pet owners now!"
"Maintenance and repairs completed in timely way, increased tenant rights services and pets to be accepted in rental and body corporate agreements "
More rental properties available 
Real estates going back on their word even though there is written permission. 
More consistent and timely engagement from Property Managers.
Agent and landlord response to maintenance request. Communication with agent lacking.
Maintenance of the garden by all tenants.
Less compliance.  While I am all for safety and the tenants deserve a safe maintained home you tend to have to do more on a rental property than you do on your own home you live in.
Let’s should be allowed by default and should be allowed indoors. I’d be happy to pay an extra cleaning fee or bond to be able to have them inside.
The limitation on the properties available if you have pets
"Tighter controls on tenants.  Unfortuantely, tenants abuse and ignore common courtesies and responsibilities when they own nothing.  Reducing controls and obligations on tenants will make the landlord's investment more vulnerable to negligent, carelessness and abuse.  There are many many irresponsible tenants in my experience there are more of these types of tenants than there are good ones.   Two tenants, back to back, in one property cost me over $30,000 in damages, one of those tenants, the highest cost was repairing animal inflicted damage.  Wake up you people.  If they don't own it they certainly aren't going to respect it or look after it."
I'd like to see a broader relationship between owner and tenant encouraged.  Less intrusion by the third party - the Property Manager.
Allowing Pet ownership in rentals
More realistic rental prices. 
Repairs to be carried out quicker.
"A greater emphasis on property being maintained at an acceptable living standard, and easier access to information about tenants rights. "
Responsibility of tenants to care for the home.  Tenant notice to vacate should be equal to landlord notice to vacate (2 months although I would be happy with one month for both).  Tenants should be responsible for avoidable damage they cause without having to go to court or the media
Allow pets in rentals 
"Allow pets inside, not only outside as long as tenants are required to do professional carpet clean on vacating and flea treatment."
"When a rental property is up for sale the tenants should be allowed to break their lease without penalty or have the option for a weekly rent decrease. Tenants are the people most affected by the sale of the property they reside in (eg. inspections, open house events) with the least to gain from the sale of a property."
As landlord i allow pets and other requests but absolute destruction of my property (and acknowledgement of same) by pets urine and defecation has resulted in no compensation and lengthy arguments. Damage needs to be compensated.
"As a tentant - The entry and exit requirements (and forms) are far too convoluted. There should be standard logical  forms with enough space and non repetitive questions for collecting personal information and a limit to what they can ask for, or at least have the confidence of a privacy policy..
As a landlord - the poor quality of staff attracted to work as property managers is of concern, as this their attitude. At a recent end of lease, they spoke about ‘opportunities’ to deduct from the renters bond (seemingly without referrring to the entry report, as most items raised were on that)"
The real estate agents treat you like dirt whether your a great tenant or not 
The rules on having no pets allowed 
Communication needs to be improve with the property managers
Less vagueness in the act.
Property managers r over the top when it comes to exit inspections.  Also pets need to be allowed and discrimination toward families w kids needs to stop. Property managers have too much power and so i feel reluctant to protest anything as they can affect u securing future properties. Agents should not be allowed to sell their rental roles to other agents. I choose houses based on suitability and the reputation and attitude of the agency.
Forcing owners to carry out repairs eg broken power points/doors that don’t lock/mouldy etc.
Being able to have repairs done quicker. Ie maybe the agent having an amt they can spend up to without having to get landlords permission. I am not saying the Tennant fix it themselves but making the process that little bit faster by having an amt where the repairs can just be done asap without owners permission.
Make Tennant's more accountable for their actions. If it is believed that the Tennant is breaking the lease agreement an spot visit can take place as giving notice under the current scheme the Tennant's have time to fix the problem only to go back to do what they where doing before the visit and there is not a thing that can be done about it
Reducing the power of Landlords and Real Estate Agents
"Preventing Real estate members from being allowed to enter rental property when tenants not home as it is an invasion of privacy, unless the tenant is no co-operating and not making time for an inspection to occur. Inspection timing windows need to be reduced also, leaving work for 3 hours to wait for the Real estate member to show up is a long time away from work and should be reduced to at least a 1 hour window. "
More availability of pet friendly rentals. And rent prices espeically on the gold coast are out of control
We were happy the three times we have rented in Queensland.
"We rent our investment property to relatives and did not increase rent for 6 years, but now are struggling to cover the many increased costs without a big increase in rent which we won't do.  "
"Increase certainty. For example, the majority of the legislation is open to interpretation."
Cost of renting vs government benefits leaves me with virtually nothing to raise my son.
Encourage long term leasing (2-5 years)
Fairer laws for both parties.  
Allowing to own a pet dog or cat
"Ensure agents provide sufficient alternative methods for payment of rent e.g. BPay, Credit Card, Direct Deposit"
Require the Government to complete infrastructure project they have promised which may improve rental prpoerty prices.
Tighter guidelines for tenant.
have landlords attend to repairs in a timely fasion
"Promotion of the house (some places just have a phone number, no images or a website) and more information about the home that is being rented (some homes don't say the price, only after contacting them will you get that information. Which is a waste of time)."
Being more open to pets for families.
"I’ve had my property damaged, tenants not pay rent and evicted. All which was at my expense as the renters were able to get away with it. The stress and time to repair the property have completely turned me off ever investing again. "
Increase the size of the bond payment
To not get penalized for owners broken houses and loose my bond because of pre-existing damage.
"tenants paying higher bond, so to cover costs when they leave."
"Real estates do not provide an update to tenants after performing house inspections, even to say if everything is going well. Real estates should be more flexible with sharehouses because it is often a necessary arrangement and an individual's plans change and they need to be able to move without an ""Administration fee"" to the real estate (a fee not paid to the landowner)."
Pets are to be kept outside and not allowed into the house they cause damage to a property.
"More timely response to my requests to have things fixed at my rental property. The last 3 rental properties I've lived in, it's taken up to 12 months to get something fixed."
"I would like to see more of a relationship between the owner and tenant. 
"
"Tenents should have more rights to own a pet, hang things on the wall, get repairs done and more rights and fairness when moving out. "
"be able to have more open discussions with owners, and be able to suggest improvements that could be made to the property. Seeing as through tenants live in their property, if we had an ability to discuss openly with owners on modifications that could be made to the property to create a better place to live, and more profitable to the owner"
"Nothing, if it’s not broken leave it alone. "
"Tenants should ALWAYS require permission from a landlord for pets. Certain pets can cause considerable damage, to which a bond will not suffice."
"The amount of information required for an application is excessive. This requires the provision of very personal information that is then kept by the rental agency regardless of success in the application. Eg, multiple pay slips, rental ledger history, bank statements, utility statements, passport and driver licence"
Being able to make the house 'our home' by personalising it.
"One thing I'd like to change is the experiences I've had in interacting with real estate companies. For example, I had an experience in which I left a share house and paid the real estate company to have my name removed from the lease. I found out over a year after leaving the property that this had not been done when I received notice that the property was in arrears. With the same real estate company, I was left for 2 months without air conditioning over the summer as they were not prompt in arranging repairs."
The imbalance of power between real estate agents and renters. In the past I have had the experience of needing to get maintenance done on house and they refuse. If you complain they just don’t renew lease. It took me 3 months to get a broken door fixed. There is no real recourse for dealing with unscrupulous agents from a tenants point of view. 
"The number one thing I would change is the frequency of inspections in long term tenancies. Still after 3 years, we have inspections every 3 months. It's really an invasion of our privacy!
I understand that at the beginning it's good to have them regularly to get to know the tenant and to make sure there's no damage going on but nothing changes here in 12 weeks!
For long term tenants it needs to change. Every 6 to 12 months is more than sufficient to know what's happening in your property. 
And it really bothers me that they take photos of everything at every inspection! How is my personal information stored?
How are these photos, that show all my belongings, stored? How do I know that they are just seen by the landlord and owner?
These are really a breech of my right to live comfortably and quietly in my own home. 

And finally, it really bothers me that landlords charge you to pay rent. They advertise the price, you sign the contract, and then they tell you that every way you can pay rent has fees! It's disgusting. They take a cut of the rent to cover administration costs why then is it perfectly legal to pass this cost onto the tenant!
Things need to change. 
We're excellent tenants and we get treated like criminals. "
Allow pets and make it easier to enter into long term lease arrangements.
"Security. There is zero security for the renter, with eight weeks before a rental renewal the rental can be terminated. This is not only an incredibly stressful situation to be placed in, it is often a completely impossibly scenario to come up with six week rent (four for bond and two weeks advance) in order to secure another property."
"1. Agents/owners respond with maintenance requests and when they do need to replace an item, that it be of the same value or similar. Not a cheap version that does not match the property you leased in the first place.
2. That pet owners are not discriminated against
3. That we can hang pictures on our walls, etc.
"
"Pets should be allowed in all stand-alone properties, perhaps with an additional portion of bond to be paid."
"There needs to be a more even approach to landlords and tenants. At the moment, it tends to favour tenants."
"Knowing my rights, or rights being more clear. Landlords knowing boundaries and what the can and can't do.

Mainly making things clearer and having paperwork to support it. "
Availability of much longer term rental agreements - eg. 5 years. Better for the tenant and landlord for security.
My renting experience would be improved if landlords were more accepting of pets when considering rental applications.
An increase in the rights of renters.
"Communication between Landlord and myself is poor. Difficult, having to go through property manager and myself and then onto the client. Majority of the time I do not get any answers back."
Make more pet friendly
"To have Realestate agents monitored along with owners of the properties more thoroughly. There is this constant fear of eviction, property damage and higher fees when wanting to discuss matters with the agents who govern the rental for the owner. "
"Being able to make the property feel like home, particularly hanging pictures/ artwork on the walls. "
All Real Estate agents be consistent and the RTA act to be easily understood 
"Definitely easier to find residences that are pet friendly. I have excellent rental references inclusive of pets, but if pets aren’t allowed, pets aren’t allowed! "
The ability to have pets without immediate denial
More controls over building managers in complexes - my experience is that Real Estates treat you with respect as a customer but my building manager behaves like she's doing me a favour.
Alot of real estates are not confident in the laws they are governing. Many are not doing the right thing and as a land lord i want to ensure that the law is upheld and that both my rights and the tenants rights are protected and the information we both receive is correct. I feel when you hire a real estate to manage your property i should be confident that the information i receive is true and not have to go to the RTA or any other advocasy service to double check what ive been told.
Stability in housing and confidence in a rental agreement being fulfilled. 
"Three month inspections are ridiculous, these need to be annual. Lease terms need to be longer, minimum two years or five years would be better to offer SECURITY to renters. "
Be clear on tenant/owner rights when signing lease agreements
I absoluetly disagree that the home owner must pay for the waterusage of the tenant.
"A higher bond so that all expenses at tenancy end can be compensated. Eg. Repair 2 holes in wall $300, remove rubbish ( often furniture) to dump $100, yard clean-up $100. Not enough bond and therefore it usually becomes an aggravated situation."
"The Real estate agents - communication with Remax is a joke, our landlord visits monthly to mow lawns and I now just go directly to him for advice or assistance, he is just as upset with them as we are"
longer lease agreements should be made available for good tenants
"I feel like we have zero rights.  My bond was once taken away from me for a house that was condemned.  Not only this, the damage was not my fault, It was termite damage, and also caused from water pipes leaking through the walls.  I have had friends lose their bonds for houses that were demolished within weeks after moving out, and another friend who lost her bond after the bathroom floor collapsed due to mould and water damage. I agree that real estates need to do inspections, but I also believe council should be doing regular inspections on rental properties to ensure they are fit to live in.  It is unfair to expect tenants to pay top dollar for homes that are not fit for people to live in.  The Gold Coast is shocking for this sort of thing and tenants are petrified to say anything about it through fear of being evicted."
A larger bond amount
"Options for longer term leases. More clarity around break lease terms. 
Biggest issue with renting is the return of the bond and disagreements about fair wear and tear. Real estate agents seems to use any TINY item to reduce the bond (forgetting the concept of fair wear and tear). The issue with this is that it is very difficult to apply for a rental when you have had money deducted from your previous bond."
"Greater flexibility around having pets. The process to seek approval to have a new pet is unreasonable, and when applying for a property when you have a pet - this is considered above and beyond any rental history and tenants ability to look after a property."
"Restrict smoking on balconies in multi unit complexes, as the smoke from neighbours that smoke on their balconies or at entrances to complexes comes in through open windows resulting in unwanted passive smoking for tenants that want fresh air. The consequence of this behaviour restricts no smoking tenants by them having to keep windows closed. When you open a window to get some fresh air someone in an adjoining unit seems to light up polluting the fresh air again."
"3 monthly inspections, 6 monthly rental increases and intrusive visits from owners of the property. "
"Allowance for pets. It's so hard to find rentals allowing pets, when they are so important to many people."
"My Landlord is fantastic!  But the agency is terrible. Poor communication. Do not respond to emails or requests.

If I could change anything it would be to regulate the Realestate Agencies!

As a Landlord myself, the agencies I have been with (I have changed due to poor communication) have failed to pass on messages to me, maintenance request etc. Its easier for my tenants to come straight to me. "
Not provide a rental property at all. In our experience with 3 different rentals that we owned over the years 2 of them were abused and we lost a lot of money when we sold them...all due to the tenants who should never be able to do that to another owner EVER!
Obligations of owners to fix/address issues when they arise.
"Faster repairs, more honest agents, not being afraid of being blacklisted for asking for my legal rights."
Make solar panels mandatory for rental properties. 
The real estate attend the property with the tenant for the exit inspection.
More availability for pet friendly houses
"Ability to hang pictures and make small improvements to the space, and lower renting prices"
Allow the ability for longer term leases.
"longer lease agreements. There was no security of tenure, the landlord would only sign 6 month leases. and then increase the rent every six months. "
"On the whole I have always had a good relationships with my property managers and landlords, however, there was one property where the landlord was stingy for repairs (the old-style electricity box kept shorting and I was advised to rewire it myself, which I did, mostly at night).  The property manager refused to look or speak to me during inspections, which was confronting and creepy. Perhaps there could be a register of complaints or a rating system (based upon actual events, not opinion) of owners and property managers that potential tenants could access before committing to a rental contract.  I have found that the rental contract is not only for the property but also the relationship with the property manager and landlord as well.  My current property managers have always been quick to respond to maintenance requests and seem to balance the landlords needs as well as mine."
Being able to hang pictures on the walls 
estate agents carry out inspections diligently 
Make owners to reconsider their negativity towards indoor pets
Pets being allowed in all rentals
Even notice period for both tenants and landlords
"Genuine consequences for real estate agents with poor practice- e.g. real estates entering property without notice 

No TICA listings, or a maximum of 6 months listing. "
Being allowed to hang pictures on walls
The agent's attitude or perception of tenants versus landlords - that the interests of owners are always seen as paramount and tenants can be treated with a level of disregard because ultimately they are viewed as having no power in the scheme of things.
Better screening of tenants history 
being informed of any work going to be carried out
"Allow compensation for tenants when the property doesn't provide the core requirement to be able to live in a property without inconvenience and issue.
Allow tenants to be able to raise disputes without fear they may be kicked out"
Not having to constantly ask before doing anything.
"I would tightly regulate Residential Unit Managers.
They are often dishonest and they wield power over the owners in insidious ways.
It's very hard to take your property from one who is doing the wrong thing.
"
Longer leases (over 12mths). Realistic rents
Ability to make the home your own. 
"Pets shouldn't be allowed in rental property, if they do, then compensation should be in place for recovery cost, like turf are worn or damages within the property."
Reduce the amount of paperwork required by agents before they will accept an application for tenancy
More flexibility with lease agreements 
"Houses rented to be safe and maintained.
Should be cleaned by Owner out of bond when break lease occurs before next tennant moves in.
Gardens should be sensibly planted and not over grown with no dump or trailer available to tennant."
"Landlords need to maintain their property. IE Fix appliances included in the rent including pop up sprinklers, pools, holes in roof, fences, fans, air conditioners, dishwashers and pass on any tip vouchers they receive.
It's not fair that the owner can say they don't want to fix it when the Tennant is paying for it in their rent"
I would like to be able to hang more pictures and to have a pet. Hard to make a rental feel  like home more often than not.
"Making the eviction process more efficient. It is too prolonged and allows tenants to remain in the premises without paying rent. If tenants are on social security Centrelink benefits, the courts should be able to garnishee full rental payments. Landlords still have to repay their loan repayments whilst the court system goes through the current prolonged process. "
Better quality entry and exit reports 
"Rules are too one sided towards the tenants in some regards, other regards favour the landlords"
Stop people from banking pets
Accountability of renters to damage to property.
Timeframes for contractors to attend
"Owners to be more responsible for repairs  and more of water costs for their gardens their lawns ...
If you live in a home 10 yrs you been told they’re pulling carpets they shouldn’t be professionally cleaned especially if you cleaned them twice a year!
When doing a entry report PM shouldn’t be  rude n abrasive to new tenants ...
We need a contact easy access to make complaints on such people"
More properties to be accepting of pets. A large majority of pet owners will look after a property with greater care as they do not want to jeopardise having a home for their pet.
"As a full-time university student, the lack of serious consideration for my applications of rentals and price affordability. "
Standard guideline for bond refunds for tenants and agents.
Reduced rent for long term renters (1year or longer)
Owner has the last say
Knowing precisely what responsibilities and obligations are required to maintain gardens.
"Ability to have pets without the hassle and limitations places available.
Real estates that actually knew what they were doing. 
Landlords who cared about their properties. "
Allow more transparency between the tenants and owners
Agents/owners can enter the property without a reasonable period of notice. 24 hours is not enough nor reasonable. Seven calendar days is reasonable. 
Property managers ability to shut down communal areas/facilities  for extended periods of time
"Tenants care for property
Rent paid in advance"
Real estates should not be allowed to give house keys to contractors etc to enter when you are not there.
"respect from owners and agents, esp when rent to escalate"
"Have agents be more conscientious with the pre, during and exit inspections. "
"The landlords have to clean up and fix the damage caused more times than I can count the damage is more than the bond. If they a dog and has parvovirus out yards are infected for at least 8 years. If another tenant get a dog and get the parvovirus virus its on the landlord. Tenants can leave rubbish around causing rodent infestation and that’s the landlords problem.
If s trnsnt falls behind in rent we have to edit to get them out bond does nit cover lack if rent and damage caused. If a tenant can give 2 weeks notice on a periodic lease then the same for the landlord not 8 weeks we currently have. Renters gave all the rights and no responsibility. They use the property cause west and tear, their use wears out the washers in taps but it’s tge kandlords responsibility to replace them. We gave  to accept general wear and tear but where does that end. If it’s to be fair make it EQUAL for both sides. "
Better responsibility control for real estate agents / management. We changed because of lack lustre agent. 
"The rules with rent in advance and bond are overly skewed in the tenant's favour. If a tenant stops paying rent, they have 7 days before they can be breached and another 7 to rectify. That means that half the bond is already used up before you can even file to QCAT. By the time the case is heard the whole bond is used on late rent so there's nothing left for possible damage, final water bills, cleaning etc. Landlords should be able to ask for more bond, with a 4 week cap only on properties that service low income people eg: $300 per week instead of the current $700 per week. If the law allows the market to decide what's appropriate, that would be a better solution as many tenants offer to pay more to increase their likely hood of being approved and to show they are responsible, but are not able to due to current lawas."
"Been able to have pets and been able to hang pictures on walls, making the home feel like home not just somewhere to sleep."
The amount of paperwork involved.
Tenant rights and how the tenant is treated by the rental agencies.
"Most things are out of date or just not working ie stoves  dishwashers. carpets and floors are likely dirty and need to be re done. walls need repainting. My last house i had rented for ten years. the landlord only worked on the house as he was to sell it. the fence had fallen down , the walls needed a good paint , shower was in dire need of a reno and the carpet was atrocious even after i had spent money trying to clean them professionally. the back patio had been ate away at by termites? and needed to be replaced. I feel that renting in australia is crap. i doubt i will ever be able to afford to buy so renting needs to be more flexible. in other countries there are 5 year leases and ability to renovate to look after the property properly. they dont have bossy real estate agents breathing down their neck every 3-4 months and taking photos of everything which is disgusting and demeaning to the tenants. not everyone will like your way of living. i feel that australian landlords and realty agents are too controlling so they will never be this flexible to back off on their ""house inspections"" and taking photos of everything or allow for longer durations of leases. we rent through nahc in qld and the amount of paper work is ridiculous. the houses are ridiculous and we can hear everything our bogan neighbours say. i loathe it with a passion but cant afford to move out to somewhere with diginity. i wish we could put curtains up or establish a garden in our yard to block out some of the bogans and their squawking and smoking. i wish we could have normal clothes lines instead of the ones we currently have.  I couldnt imagine a life of this and have encouraged my daughter to try harder and immigrate to a different country to gain some quality of life. it can be very oppressive and strict here which is sad and tiring. the hardest part is allowing the right tenants to be trusted with longer leases and being able to alter the houses as they could be unable to get a mortgage. the rules and regulations need to be altered to be able to let tenants who can't or don't want a mortgage and have longer leases , less nosey realty and land lords and be able to set the house up to be comfortable. i feel that the laws and regulations are so strict because some people have no respect for rentals which is a mind set that will need to be changed to be able to allow for more flexibility and i definitely wouldn't want my super attached to a rental "
"Being able to make the property you rent a home rather than being forced to beg to have your pets, to make slight alterations to the property to make it your own, to hang artwork without permission."
Return rental bonds after one year renting same property
Clear timeline and guidelines for carrying out of maintenance. 
"Being able to let my dog stay on the premises as it is a no dog policy and I am currently paying $210 per week in a boarding kennel until my daughter can take him in about 8 weeks or so and counting... my poor boy is old, does not dig or do damage as he just lays around watching me all day.. I miss him so much. He is my baby. "
"More privacy for renters when a property is being sold. It's a very invasive experience with the contents of your home gone through by potential buyers as they open every cupboard in the place. Open houses are distressing as are the constant walk-through's by potential buyers. I rent as well as own a rental property, so I do see both sides of the argument. But I think some restrictions need to be put in place to protect renters in this situation. "
"Landlords should never do maintenance work on rental properties themselves if they are not qualified to do so.  We contact our property manager when things need fixing or replacing, they don't do anything without the consent of the owner and our landlord arrives unannounced and does repairs himself when he isn't qualified to do so.  Investment home owners should be made to go through rental property agents."
Fairer pricing / rents
I left a property in July 2017.  I had rented the property for a good 6 years and the real estate were trying to get me to replace the carpet claiming it was beyond wear and tear.  It made me realise that regardless of who keeps the bond real estates can say anything and have way too much power.  While I received my bond back it took a long time and way beyond the anticipated timeframe.  Real estates often blame property owners in that you ask for something to be fixed and the response if often the owner hasn't approved this yet etc etc.
The owners should get advantage when it comes as any problems related to rental property because of the tenant.
Tenants being held more accountable for damages
"Access to inspection reports given to landlords, and some sort of evidence that personal information has been destroyed in a secure manner in the event of an unsuccessful rental application. Having to supply such detailed financial and personal information, sometimes on mass, often leads to anxiety around the potential for identity theft/fraud. "
Better communication between owners and real estate
I would want the managers/owners to respect the fact that a rented house/apartment is still my HOME.  My space & respect given to that fact
Being allowed to make the house feel like a home by hanging pictures up. Making it easier to rent when you have a pet and not be limited to what properties is available 
"more transparency in contracts. More flexibility to terminate lease sooner based on availability of new property, if landlord does not want to extend/renew current lease. "
nothing comes to mind 
Better and quicker response from realestate agent to fix things - this is as a renter and a landlord- realestate agents are always slow to respond to both tenants and landlords.
"Increase the rights of renters in ways that are legally defined and enforceable. there gets a point where the RTA just tells you that it sucks to be you, but they can't do anything. 
for an entire year I was in a battle with my real estate agent over lost money. I was always ahead 2 weeks, but somehow 2 weeks of my rent was lost. I could prove that it had gone into their account, but the agents kept telling me I was lying. With bank statements?! It was the most bizarre situation, but not event the worst. the fact that the agents didn't tell me about the significant criminal history of the house, wouldn't maintain it, and lied about things being in working order when I signed the lease, only to tell me when I moved inI couldn't use them because they were broken an would not be replaced. 
While I respect there has to be protection of the owners property, I have always been a perfect tenant, and have been punished for trying to maintain issues when owners refuse to fix them. its so disheartening when you seem to care more about the property than the owner. "
Timeframe on repairs to properties as some repairs are never made or take an extremely long time to be addressed. 
"The role of real estate agents (including punishment for breaches of the Act, acting contrary to their interests and failing to pass on notices and complaints from tenants)."
Sell the rental property
"Less frequent inspections, to upkeep privacy. They can be very invasive, especially if you are not home.

Pets would be so nice. I’ve avoided having a pet because it is too hard to rent with one."
Nothing at the moment. My tenants are good and there have been no complaints so far.
"In All my renting experiences they have been a great partnership with us and owner.  Up until my last
landlord.
I wish the real estate had more input into the upkeep of the housing in rentals "
"Compulsory for Tenants to have carpets professionally cleaned upon vacate 
Pets - also compulsory to have professionally treated for pests"
A fixed break lease agreement
"Property inspections are currently every 3 months with one week's notice and no requirement for the tenant to be present.    I would like to see inspections moved to 4-5 months with at least 2-3 weeks notice and some effort made to work with the tenant for a suitable time, so they have the option to be present."
A responsive property manager would be good.
"1. There needs to be a longer period of time to complete a condition report at the start of a tenancy.
2. Periodic inspections should be limited to a maximum of 2 per year."
"If an application is declined, I would like to know the reason"
Tenants should not be treated like 2nd class citizens.
We could make changes to space.
Being allowed to have pets - even if an extra bond is required.
"Communication with leasing agent. It is a very slow, frustrating, one-way process."
Better communication between owner and agent. I seem to have to ask and ask for repairs or improvements to be done 
Application process with Real Estates. Pets being not allowed.
Pets allowed in all rentals 
"As a landlord, have more control over what tenants can get away with while renting"
Increased respect to tenants as an equal partner in the renting industry and not as a less important factor than the owner and property management staff
Give more power to tenants. It’s a constant battle not to be treated as somehow inferior because you rent
"Make property managers more responsible. If there is a problem with the rental it always falls on the owner. and property managers don't advocate for their tenants. they will tell an owner there is a problem and leave them to make a decision as to whether it is fixed and in whatever timeframe. the blame is passed to the owner that she/she didn't fix it. however if some responsibility that they haven't pushed for the owner to get problems rectified, is assigned to the agent then I'm sure certain things would get sorted alot quicker. If you fill out a form of notice to remedy breach, there is the concern that the landlord won't renew the lease as you are considered a problem"
"Less grey and open to interpretation laws.
ie you can call the RTA for advice and you will get several different responses."
Have a regulation that ensures that agencies display correct and full information on properties that are listed. 
"Tenants can put their feet in the shoes of the property owners. If tenants can do simple trouble shooting before they call up for maintenance, the experience will be much better."
Self manage the property 
Clearer responsibilities between landlord and tenant around grey areas such as light bulbs. Tenant should be responsible for water usage whether property is water efficient or not. 
"Owners / Real State agents always invent excuses to keep the bond even the property has been rented for several years. It is hard to track the initial status of some properties and then you are charged for things that you did not do. If you take to tribunal, the real state always in.
Tenants not respect visitors parking and if they have several cars they use all  of them. There is no regulation for it and for people parking in front of your house."
More rights in regards to pet ownership 
Making it easier to report issues and get them fixed. 
Being allowed to have pets inside and being able to hang pictures
Clearer rules around pets at properties.  One rental agreement allowed pets. But when the property manager did inspection on a day where it was storming and pouring rain she went off because we had the dogs inside...
"I would most definitely change Rental Agencies refusal to consider tenants work commitments when planning inspections and maintenance.  I am very uncomfortable with strangers accessing my home when I am not here.  I have requested with my current and last Real Estate to plan my inspections and maintenance when it crops up to be on a Tuesday which is my RDO.  Both refused even when they have numerous rental properties in the area and are not far away, to allow any flexibility.  Therefore I have to use my leave or have a day off without pay to accommodate the inspections\maintenance."
"The real estate agents that manage rentals should be held to a code of ethics because when I have rented through an agency I always have problems, either with the staff being incredibly rude or non-responsive to requests for repairs. They clearly are only concerned about the landlords and have no regard for the rentors that pay the bills."
"More flexibility leases, i.e. terms for 3, 6, 9, 12 months as standard options.

Rental increases to be in line with current market (ability for owner to increase rent if the market warrants it)"
better hot water systems
length of tenancy agreements
"'- Even the playing ground between landlords and renters. Property managers need to actually be objective, not just roll with whatever the landlord says goes in regards to unreasonable requests to fix things when bond inspections take place, or tenants asking for reasonable repairs or reimbursements that get ignored. "
"Better systems for chasing, prosecuting and recovering money from tenants that leave with debts or have willfully damaged properties."
Only 12 month inspections and have the opportunity to rent week to week
"Capped rent increases, longer lease terms, no water charges,  minimum standards for rental housing including energy efficiency and safety standards."
"More availability, quicker turn around times for applications, more affordable renting close to the CBD in safe areas, more housing (rather than just apartments), more flexibility for people with pets "
Allowing pets in all suitable properties
Strengthen lessors' positions when it come to fairness vs lessors
Property managers need to be held accountable for processing issues or conveying messages to owners in a TIMELY manner. They also need to inform renters of relevant bills and requests upon receiving them - not months or years afterwards. 
More available rentals that accept pets.
Staggering of building approvals to fill properties more equitibly
Dealing with incompetent administration from Real Estates.
Pet bonds and further checks on pet ownership to make sure a tenant will care for their pets and property
"More rights for tennants. Property managers are not adequately trained and from experience, rarely display professional integrity."
"The industry is full of corrupt behaviour for one. Anti competitive practices 
Landlords should be able to claim damages easier in exchange for having no say in how their tenents live. Should be able to have pets as a right as long as you fix any damage they cause 
Real Estate agents are blatantly corrupt and don’t even hide the fact they will black list tenants who don’t jump through every hoop. It’s criminal. They have done it to us in the past. "
"More ethical and transparent realestate practices that protect & respect the rights, privacy and dignity of tenants."
"Being able to hang pictures.
Not being forced to sign a fixed term contract over a periodic agreement."
Better communication with real estate like waiting for new contract 
Remove fair wear and tear from legislation eg  so forcing screen door open without opening door lock and smashing door frame isn't fair wear and tear 
Better service from the RTA 
Make tenants understand their responsibilities better and make them realise they live in someone else's house. 
"When lessors/Agent give Form 12 - Notice to leave to tenants and they do not leave, lessors/agents need to make urgent applications to QCAT for a Warrant of Possession for failure to leave which means that it may take weeks or months before tenants vacate property. During this time, tenants may not pay the rent which leaves lessors out of pocket. Tenants may also leave the property unclean and damage which leaves the lessors further out of pocket.  This is not fair for lessors as lessors have bills/mortgages to pay when tenants are living in the property rent free with no responsibility to pay rent, or clean or repair. Lessors can blacklist tenant on TICA however its only listed for  3 years then tenants are free to any debt to lessors which is unfair to Lessor. Even listing tenants on TICA cost lessors several hundred dollars to list tenants on TICA leaving lessors more out of pocket."
Freedom to keep pets - inside and outside.
Consider use of property manager
Being able to transfer bonds and not having to come up with all this money upfront.
"Longer term leases
Stipulations around what ""clean"" is at end of tenancy
Great transparency around what constitutes a safe rental property, given different ages of properties"
Having pets allowed more often especially from families who can have reference of great pet care. 
Consistency with standard terms and definitions (fair wear and tear and damage). 
"The ability to really make it my home with pictures, fixtures, painting and pets."
That tenants clearly understand that the property must be returned to its original condition upon commencement of tenancy.  
Make it easier for landlords to evict bad tenants
Tenants have enough. Landlords need more say
"More ability for private Landlord/Managers to look into and obtain evidence  the history of possible tenants, many real estate companies will not give this information to private Landlords, it should be legislated that they do."
"Needs to be more accountability for agents. Tenants have no idea whether owners are getting information that tenants want passed on etc. Also agents disputing small amounts on bond (actually not payable) and then the whole bond being withheld, there should be mandatory declaration of the amount to be withheld and the remainder of the bond released until the dispute is resolved."
"When letting out a property as landlord it should be 100% incumbent on the tenant to bear 100% of the water and sewage bills. It should be always user pays. Why not the landlord chip in for the tenants petrol also so the tenant can travel to & from the property also? It is absurd that the landlord should pay anything at all especially if the property is water efficiency rated. The theory that an allowance of water for watering gardens etc should be borne by the Landlord is rubbish because hardly any tenants care at all about watering gardens. Landlords have to bear the extra taxes such as State Emergency Levies, incidental Ambulance Levies, Waste Bin Levies, Heritage Levies, Environment Levies, Transport Levies. These should be reviewed on a user pays basis & most borne by the tenant. The Landlord is too easily and commonly the Whipped One when governments want to raise funds.This should be fixed once and for all."
QCAT failures - 6 weeks to hear an urgent application is waaaaaay too long.
"Better cooperation between landlords and tenants, instead of a us vs them approach."
 photo's not allowed to be taken for any reason unless it is for repairs and maintenance just had this experience and got kicked out because I stuck up for my rights
Constantly struggling to get repairs done by real estate. 
The way the real estate have too much power over the bond.
"Owner coming to the party with property maintenance eg, gardens, lawns and plants."
Increase bonds to cover runners & damage
"From a property owner, more stringent selection requirements to select suitable tenants.  There is a lot of money that the property owner has invested in the property, and it is imperative that caring suitable tenants be chosen.
"
"The ability to make minor alterations without seeking approval. Picture hooks are the example that comes to mind. In my last rental (I was there 5 years) but I was not allowed to have picture hooks of any kind. This makes it difficult to make a place feel home-y and I would have to lean pictures against the wall on the bookcases etc... I appreciate that property owners are concerned about large hooks that can damage walls quite significantly, but to not be able to even put up the Command style adhesive hooks was a bit much. 
The other thing I would change is the length of leases. I was in my last property for five years and had to sign 12 month leases. The property owner was a long term owner. In my current property the previous tenants had been there for eight owners. In both instances the property owners were long term investors that wanted long term tenants. I think in instances such as this it would be beneficial to have long term leases. "
Property managers/estate agents/owners be more accountable for the timely and proper repairs to rental properties. 
"Agents need to provide tenants with more information on waste disposal because every council area is different and it takes time to work out how it works when you move to new areas. Eg, They should provide information on how each type of waste is to be sorted for the rubbish and when that type of waste is collected or how to dispose of things that cant be collected. And same goes for human waste - if there is a septic system they should provide information on how to properly use it."
Landlords that get repairs done
"Fewer inspections if you have a long history of being a good tenant and payment on time. Quarterly inspections are intrusive and a constant reminder that it's not your own home.
Small pet ownership should also be a given in all rental properties.
"
As I live by myself having a dog would be wonderful for companionship 
"1. less frequent housing inspections - reduce to six months for long term tenants.
2. 30 days notice for terminating lease - 14 days is not long enough to find a new home."
"Nothing it has always been brilliant.
I do the right thing provide the correct information and leave the property as I found it.
The agents never have an issue."
Improved rights for landlords to lease once a tenant vacates
Bond should be higher than 4 x the weekly rent.
"Rental agents in the past have not turned up fro inspections at the time specified. Don't return calls, or communicate clearly."
"'- allowing easier access to viewing properties (eg. outside of business hours)
- allow for cheaper rental prices
- allowing for applying for properties without viewing by signing a waiver
- "
Having a dog I would like to see rental reference for dogs.
Owners rights and their ability to have more of a say on their home. 
I dont believe that owners/managers have the enough rights when it comes to troublesome tenants that have arrears/damages. Trying to remove tenants who problem tenants is not an easy task. during this process it costs owners money. Yes this can be put on to the tenants but it is always difficult to recover any funds.
Making property managers accountable to the tenants and have them do some basic course about rights and responsibilities. 
I would like property managers to be more accountable. 
"Make sure the Landlord is completing general repairs and maintenance throughout the tenancy. 
Have contractors/tradespeople contact the tenant/s direct to arrange a suitable time to complete repairs and maintenance rather than receiving entry notices.  "
More black and white clarification
Having maintenance issues addressed.
i find the fact that tenants do not pay their rent on time to be offensive and the fact you as the owner can do little about it.
Make it easier to take action against real estates and owners who don't follow their obligations.
"Legislation to be more detailed, not so vague."
I am a landlord renting my property and I feel that my tenants are able to expect more than is logical/feasible.  I would like them to live like an owner occupier and understand that changes/fixes are not possible as quickly as they want them.
The improvement in price affordability
Tighter controls on how a property should be maintained to be considered livable. 
The way the industry attracts incompetent and petty property managers who do the bare minimum so they can maximise their profits.
"Real estates cover the cost of existing damage to the property. For example if you move into a property that is not up to standard, needs maintence or the landlord still needs to fix, you as the tenant should not be forced to fix it or improve the property at the end of your lease.  Also landlords should have to fix or maintain a property within a certain time frame, not let the problem continue for months or years.  Additionally I think the rent amount should be based on the property itself and what state it is in not by suburb value or land value.  There are housed/units rented for ridiculously high amounts but look atrocious or have longstanding maintenance problems.  "
"I am currently in an NRAS (National Rental Affordability Scheme) and so far it has been great.  However this scheme is ceasing at the end of 2019 and nobody know where we are expected to go.
 "
More required training for Property Managers
"It is very frustrating to look for a long term rental only to be given just a year with an option to extend. We have been in Australia for 13 years, living in rental accommodation. Nearly every time we come to the end of the lease we are told that the owners wish to sell or move back in and we have to move. 
We have always received our bond back. We have been thanked a number of times for leaving the house/apartment cleaner than we received it. We are a middle aged, professional couple with no pets or children.  We feel that we have no security when it comes to renting.

"
A more streamlined process for applying for rental properties as a pet owner and the ability to hang things on walls. Waiting for management to handle tradespeople coming in could also be better.
Have some owners believe not all renters are derrows. Also have rents treat the rental property as there own.
"6 month leases are a joke,the cost of moving twice in a year is high.Should be minimum 1 year leases "
Longer rent periods
Properly maintained properties
Consistent legislation with fairness on both side and better protection
"Make the processes easier to deal with breaches, damages to property etc by tenants."
More rights for tenants especially if a owner decides to sell property whilst tenants are on s fixed term lease ..owners should not be allowed to put property on the market for sale until the tenants have come to the end of the fixed term agreement.
It would have been nice to have a pet-friendly property. 
"I have found many property managers in my area to be very unpleasant to deal with. As a renter I've been treated like a criminal and an idiot. Once I actually had a property manager ask me if I knew how to turn a door knob... I'm not joking. I'd change many things, but this is the biggest one. My current property manager is one of the better ones, but I'd had some shocking ones in the past. 

Property managers also mostly protect the interests of the owners, not the renters. When in actuality we are the ones actually paying, this is so backwards! 

Renting on the Sunshine Coast is extremely expensive and it's very difficult to get ahead in life when rent is so outrageous. "
Discrimination based on pet ownership.
I believe tenants have to many rights and owners have very little
"Ambiguity in the landlords favour (e.g. in the last place, we sent a bond cleaner in TWICE, only to have the landlord charge us extra for another one because of incredibly minor things such as a fingerprint on a tap)"
Agents knowledge of the act and their responsibilities
"New laws forever changing for the benefit of the tenants.Landlords/owners of properties, have no rights what so ever.Whether it goes to Mediation the issue always favours the tenants.Its about time the QLD Government, clean up their act in regards to the matters.The QLD Government legislate laws always in favour of the tenants.With this so called Renting Reform Survey, they the Government what to seem to be hearing all issues on both sides.As always the Government will do what they want any way."
"More due process, more power imbalance equalisers"
The agent was not very successful in ensuring timely delivery of documents. We ended up renting direct Tenant & Landlord directly
More protection as a tenant regarding maintenance and being allowed to have a dog at more properties.
a who is responsible for mould clause - it needs to be clear cut and if it happens whilst a tenant is in there then they are responsible for getting rid of it
The availability of Pet friendly rentals and more specifically dog friendly.
"Less death trap housing with unresponsive owners.
Less relentless price gouging.
More agent engagement on behalf of the tenants needs, not just the owners.
More bond protection.
More protection for renters quiet enjoyment of home
Less frequent property inspections
Less power to agents"
"Getting landlord to do essential repairs to have the property operating as advertised.

e.g. windows safe, air conditoner working, spa working, jetty safe"
"Allowing pets and some autonomy in how you live in a place eg not having to ask permission to put up curtains or pictures as long as you return the property to its original condition on exit. Also less inspections for good tenants, after a year of renting with no incidents inspections should be 6 monthly at most,"
I would like the owners to provide security doors and windows
make sure the RTA and Real-Estate Agents have corresponding facts sheets that are user friendly.
Reduce the amount of notice required to terminate a lewase or increase the rent. Tenants can give minimum of 2 weeks but lanmdlords must give 8 weeks. Very unbalanced. 
"I have had some very poor real estate agents.  On leaving a property they wanted me to replace all of the turf in the back yard - The turf was dead when I moved in and was only lumps and bumps of weeds
I had a lot of arguing but we eventually came to an agreement
Sometimes real estate agents try to hold a big stick and hold their power over you"
"More power, the owner not being able to throw you out of your home at the drop of a hat. Being about to increase the rent by whatever amount they want."
"I would like to have the right to transform my rental into a ""real home"". "
More properties being pet friendly.
More rentals need to allow pets. 
Allowing QCAT to have teeth and follow through decisions when tenants are in breech.
Respect shown by all parties for each other.
"Rent is very expensive where I am living. But there isn't much that can be changed, other than the fact that most renting laws does not protect the owner in some situations. But I don't know much about renting laws."
"Better communication between landlord, tenants and agents"
I think realtors need to have comprehensive data for entry and exit reports. Preferably a detailed video and images which are updated  
Lower the rental prices
Requires evidence before claims can be made to bonds. My former real estate has claimed my whole bond without obtaining a single quote to prove costs and no supporting information has been provided after request.
Pets being allowed at more rentals.  Especially for people that are good pet owners.  I usually have to rent a low grade house as they are the only ones that allow pets. 
"The whole system of renting needs changing it has been well over due and tenants need to be able to get things fixed and also in regard to contacting real estates there needs to be better communications instead of stupid games that go on,there needs to be better ways to do with complaints and breaches instead of the long drawn out process that is in place.how many people go to mediation or to qcat and how long do you have to wait to have cases heard in qcat or to get something done."
Less judgment of single parent families when applying for houses. I applied for 11 when I first arrived in Caloundra before being accepted.
More affordable housing in regional areas 
"Have minimum standards for rentals which have to be in working order, eg. water supply, electricity supply, heating and cooling, properly closing windows, insulation against cold/heat, no health hazards like mould, pests. asbestos.
Not meeting those minimum standards should allow to reduce the rent immediately after a warning period till the problem is removed. "
Tenants to give at least 1 months notice when vacating
"Longer leases. We want to stay longer than 6, 12 months. Bring in long leases like Europe has."
"Tenants should be hit with a fine when their rent or their water bill is in arrears. Somewhat similar to when you pay your electricity/ phone bill. Every day it is in arrears; an interest percentage fee is added and charged. Too many tenants not paying their bills on time, giving them (by law) extra time to pay for that bill after a breach notice is given. This leaves landlords without payment when they have already paid the bill/mortgage."
Tenants tend to have a blanket opinion that landlords are rich and tight with their money and tend not respect/treat the properties they rent as if it were there own home.  They also get away with damages as are result.  The laws are getting ridiculous with the landlords having to cover so many costs and tradespersons tend to take advantage by charging higher amounts for work done because it is an investment property and not you PPR. 
"As a property Manager, satisfied"
Making my rental more pet friendly 
"As a landlord it was devastating to have suffered thousands of dollars in damage to my property by ""good tenants. The bond did not cover the damages and landlord insurance would only pay for criminal damages as the cigarette burns in the carpet, holes in walls and the stench of cat urine were considered fair wear and tear."
Real Estate Agents not treating people like rental trash - we choose to rent not to buy We have an amazing landlord - We reciproate by being exceptional tenants 
Balance tenant and property owner interests.
with being a long term tenant (8years ) you would think that the rent wouldn't  go up 100% that is un affordable being a single mother with 2 kids .. making rent affordable 
I’d like to be able to have a pet
"We are fair landlords and have happy tennants, it would be nice if all tenants would respect our  property as their own."
Allow pets across the board
"Able to have pets without extensive negotiations 
Longer lease options
Able to make small changes / maintenance to property e.g. picture hooks, new towel racks, etc."
As a landlord no reduction in my rights as a landlord
"Allowing pictures to be hung up
Dropping the rent for long term clean renters"
Make the notification times fairer for landlords and tenants eg. landlords have to give 2 months notice on a form 12 of notice to leave. Tenant only gives 2 weeks.
Enact more protections for Landlords against defaulting tenants.
Fewer routine inspection for tenants who have proven to take very good care of the property.
The tenants can get information from the RTA and other sources. 
If someone is on a month to month rental don’t require a two month notice to tenant. If they need more notice then a longer agreement should be signed. 
I think more notice (time and more than one form of notification) when doing ROUTINE inspections would be nice.
Rental agencies to get maintenance done.  Not wait for the owner to say Yeah or Nah.  Especially ones that were in the entry report.
"Make it compulsory to have non smoking homes, we only realised the house we rented had been a smokers home after we moved in yuk the smell was over whelming and gave me headaches "
"As a Property Manager I would like to see Pet Approval with Body Corporates change.  We will have an application, which will include a pet, however, we can approve it because we have to wait for the Body Corporate to VOC (Voting Outside Committee) Vote.  This can sometime take up to 2 weeks and some Body Corporates can charge up to $200.  We risk loosing good quality Tenants for our Owners, we can take any other applications as we have to wait the outcome of this Committee.  The should be a standing order that pets are accepted, with a set of guidelines to make sure the right sort of pet is brought into the property."
"Clarity around legality of digital signatures
Better technology around bond refund process"
Rules around pet ownership seem overly strict. 
Notice periods for endings a tenancy. Make it fair like other states. Tenant giving 2 weeks notice can lead to unexpected vacancy for a property owner who needs to give 2 months notice to the tenant. Make it the same time period.
"Expectations on Property Managers to act professionally and understanding of their role.  
They are often intimidating and can react like they are personally insulted when I have asked for repairs.  I also find that some of them can be unnecessarily intrusive during inspections by making comments about my lifestyle choices, way of living and even my parenting.  I understand their role is to check on the property but when they are unnecessarily intrusive, I don't feel that they respect that it is my home.  "
"Caps on how often rent can rise. When landlords can jack up the rent, you have no power or stability. They can easily kick you out just by raising the rent. There should be a strict percentage limit on how much rents can increase by."
More security when property sells
Easier approval for pets and to be able to have them in the house. I'm happy to pay a pet bond. More ability to display things on walls under condition that holes are repaired at end of tenancy. 
"Real Estate to be held accountable and treat tenants fairly. I am part of a hard working family, always pay rent on time and my real estate try and force me to pay for things that are exempt on the contract. Water Bills should be paid for by the landlord up to 1KL per day - Water is for the gardens and grass to keep green which I believe is a house maintenance issue. General Inspections should be at a mutually agreed time. My Real Estate make it very difficult to reschedule inspections. Also the photos they want to take of each room even after I have asked them only to take photos of the house and not my private belongings. "
1. Discrimination by body corporate & owners on pet ownership by revoking approval and / or imposing weight & hair type for Tennants eg in Newstead - non shedding dogs under 5kg 2. Unreasonable / bullying by insurance companies on behalf of owners not wanting to pay for repairs 3. Owners / propety managers using bond refunds as a way to compensate for wear & tear or improperly fitted light fittings for example 
No discrimination against pet owners.
Tenants need more rights
"Landlords seem to feel it is their  right to raise the rent every year, yet they do no maintenance to the property,expect me to hold up my end of the deal with yard maintenance, despite having regular inspections and numerous reports of faults. Then they try to take the cheap option to repair rather than replace what is obviously a failed item."
"Having consistent guidelines for property condition reports on the way in & out. At present, the tenant is at the mercy of the property manager."
Allowing pets for all tenants within reason
"i rent with bch housing every time we get a rise our rent goes up we have to pay a top up onour bond ,so the money basically goes into the hands of bhc so we really do not have any extra money to cover rising costs like electricity,food,clothing the basic cost of living .We are just worse off because any little extra money we get is gone to the hands of bhc it is ridiculous ."
"As Landlord I want to retain the right to agree or disagree to allowing pets in my property. It's my asset & I want to ensure to minimise damage. Tenants treating a rental as 'their own' depends on their personal standards, integrity. Previous rental history very important for Landlord to review. "
"Being able to make sensible and agreed upon changes to the home such as new carpet, ceiling fans, being able to hang a picture"
"Providing times for real estate inspections, fire batteries replacement taking time off in working hours"
Being treated with the same respect as a home owner. I look after the properties I rent as if they were my own and being targeted by members of a Body Corporate because I am a renter is discriminating.  
"Better regulation of agents, property managers and private rental property owners."
"Longer term leases, opportunity to make a place more comfortable and personalise. "
The ability to have a pet or live in a safe neighborhood 
"Be able to make minor repairs without worry of repercussions, and be able to have longer leases as standard. "
Real estate agents being responsive to feedback.
Fear of being kicked out for asking for repairs to be done
"The real estate agents using the RTA system agenst you, eg noting any problem they have as breaches of lease with a form without any opportunities for remedy or any consistent standard between different property managers (for example dusty screens) and then not doing repairs or maintenance ,passing on rent reductions for unit block emergency works, giving approval for NBN upgrade. "
More options/rights for share housing
Minimum standards and compliance
"Landlords actually complying with legislation!
I currently have several missing louvers in my bathroom window however when I told my property manager the owner responded with “I don’t feel like fixing that” 

Pets to be allowed at more properties. Predominantly outside pets."
"Rewarding long term tenants, helping make a 'home' and providing improvements to the property that only protects the investment of the owner."
Flexibility to lease duration without incurring penalty (I.e. 4 week notice required but no 2 week rent value as penalty). 
Attitudes towards tenants and them living in a home. 
Longer term lease option (5 years plus) and ability to hang things on walls.
"Make long term renting a possibility.  Other countries allow renters to have very long term leases, up to 5+ years or more.  Moving every year or having rent increases at the end of every lease is so hard and so expensive.  No one can settle and really make a home."
Be able to hang things on walls 
Digital Signatures on leases
"I'm a property owner. I own my own home, so do not rent. I rent out an apartment as an investment property."
Watchdog on real estate agents.
More pet friendly rentals
Increase rights of tenants
Less frequent routine inspections 
"When there is an inspection take note of how long the tenants have been there & how old the property is.  Homes (carpet / paint) don't stay in the same condition as when it was brand new. 
"
Ensure Tenants are liable for the damage they cause
"Honesty from the real estate agents. 
"
"New suggested laws seem to be even more in tenants favour.  I own and privately manage a property and I am a. Fair landlord and follow all the rules but do feel tenants tend to.have all the power even though I am responsible for any property repairs, rates etc."
If rented for more than 10 years the house should be repainted or up graded
Option for longer term leases would be nice
"More accountability for managing agents and their mismanagement, lack of communication and care."
After 8 years of renting the same place not having to go through 3 monthly property checks.
Allow longer stable leases
Landlords take advantage when you leave a property by trying to keep all bond even after leaving the place cleaner than when you moved in
"'- It should be harder for landlords to evict tenants or raise rent in retaliation for requests for important repairs
- Landlords should be forced to make urgent repairs within a reasonable timeframe or face penalty
- Properties should have to meet a minimum standard of safety and liveability
- Rent should be capped
- Owners should not be allowed to list residential properties on AirBnB - apartment neighbours in particular didn't sign up to live in a hotel
- Real estate agents should not be able to bully tenants into giving up their bond"
Real estate  agents  not treating  tenets like humanbeans 
Long-term lease
"Require a good reason, set out in tenancy law, before a tenants can be asked to leave"
"Length of time for urgent QCAT hearings - tenants who refuse to pay rent and refuse to leave the property can cause substantial loss of rent due to waiting periods required for breach notices, notice to leave, QCAT application and hearing, judgement and then finally execution of warrant  - following minimum times this can still take 14 weeks to evict a tenant who is clearly gaming the system."
Minimun housing standards 
That we weren’t able to go onto a periodic lease as we only wanted to extend a lease by 2 months but were only offered a minimum of 6 months
"We often get treated poorly by real estates, ridiculously frequent inspections (3 monthly at some places) demands to improve standard despite the places being clean and tidy despite being good tenants who never have complaints or issues listed at inspections. I suppose more ability to be left alone when proven to be good tenants would be the biggest change"
"Moving every 1 to 2 years
No pets
Not being able to hang things up on walls 
Realestates very unrealistic able rental cleans
If something needs fixing they will repair and won’t renew lease , as don’t like spending money"
Ability to have pets and access to longer leases
Less restrictions in general.
Our agent did not give enough notice for inspections. That was all.
Lower property management fees. They are exorbitant in Queensland. 
Tenants who trash houses should never be able to do it again to anybody else. We lost thousands in repairs and at least 6 weeks rental income on top of that. The tenant was fine for 5 years and then went off the rails. The bond went nowhere near covering the costs. Tenants needs to eeear tge insurance costs from s select few providers and if they play up they have increased premiums and not the landlord.
Owners placing solar panels on roof. 
Having a real hard copy of what tenants can and can not do in a rental property as some tenants do not have access to an electronic version.
"Pets being allowed at properties. They are part of the family and tenants are forced to get rid of their pets or lie about it having a pets due to low pet acceptance by landlords. 

There should also be more transparency with real estates and feedback given when rental applications are denied. "
"Making renting with pets much easier, especially in the cheaper end of the market"
"Ban landlords adding (illegal) rental contract annexes with unfair contract terms.
Eg I was forced to sign a lease appendix that stated: 
a. ""the tenant/s will restore the floor to its original state at their own expense or reimburse the property owner for same"" - no mention of reasonable wear and tear
b. ""The cost of restoring the walls to their original condition will be at the tenant/s expense at the end of the lease. Do-it-yourself patch jobs are not acceptable as a professional finish is expected"" - specifying 'original condition' again ignores fair wear and tear, with the banning of self repairs being unnecessarily restrictive, especially where tenant is a tradie.
c. ""The tenant/s agrees to ensure that any furniture coming in to contact with tiling or timber flooring must be affixed with suitable felt or padding to ensure the flooring is not damaged or impacted in any way"" - how can a tenant ensure floor not impacted ""in any way"" - this is clearly a preposterous term.
d. ""Pot plants are only allowed on the balcony, and must not be in direct contact with the tiled surface"" - so I couldn't put pot plants inside, let alone put them on the balcony floor?… 
These are all 100% real contract terms imposed on me. 
Additionally the landlord's body corp manager charged me a $400 move-in bond, which appears to be in direct breach of the Act requirement that: ""A by-law (other than an exclusive use by-law) must not impose a monetary liability on the owner or occupier of a lot included in a community titles scheme"".
Furthermore, I was asked to sign the condition report BEFORE I had sighted the property, in breach of all notions of due process. (As context, my wife inspected the property originally but was interstate at the time we assumed possession, and I had never viewed the property). I was informed it was 'standard practise' by the Manager that tenants should sign the condition report without viewing the property. This is a gross breach of fair process by the manager. I assert that placing tenants under duress to falsely sign a legal document is clearly unfair, and may well even be illegal.
Finally, we were asked to signed a lease renewal under threat of eviction, ie sign long term lease (>6mths) or be terminated.
Having lived & rented in 4 states and territories and overseas I can say unequivocally that weak QLD rental laws, and unaddressed abusive practises by landlords, are the worst I have seen. Where is the enforcement action against rogue landlords? I reported all this to RTA, to no effect."
"I have had no problem to date
My tenant is very good with communication (to my real estate agent) in terms of any changes to circumstance 
"
Ease of pet friendly accommodation
Make the land lords more accountable for the property the rent out
"Bond returns when house is better cleaner than when first moved it 
Renter protection
Ban more people who destroy homes"
No pets in rental properties please
Longer rental leases
Tenants need to be held more accountable for damages to property.  Bond isn't sufficient and its a costly experience for landlords (in my experience)
Professional cleaning of carpet and soft furnishings should be compulsory.
"Greater rights for tenants regarding evictions, rent increases and the automatic inclusion of pets"
Make easier dispute resolution process. That are binding 
During lease renewal time we receive a new lease over 2 months prior to current lease expiry along with a notice to leave if we don't sign the lease making it not flexible to change. If we sign the lease and decide to move then we have to break lease unless we find something we can change to bang on the lease expiry date. 
House to be maintained. Repairs done. 
"More respect ...seems if you rent you are treated as a second class citizen.
Maintenance attended to consistently and promptly "
"To be able to have two dog when saying ‘dogs allowed’ on the rental agreement.

The amount of inspections you have to have to long term tenents that they have never had a problem with. Every three months for the first year and every six months from there after. "
Ease of renting with pets. 
"Remove lessors right to give notice to leave without reason after 18 months. Include additional leave provisions for lessors, like resumption of property for private purposes. As a compromise tenants over 18 months must give 4 weeks notice to leave. This will give tenants more confidence to ask for things they are entitled to such as repairs and challenge unreasonable rental increases. "
Enforce timely repairs
"The whole stigma about ""renters"" and ""home owners"".
A LOT of people have no choice but to rent yet the fact that a lot of people cant even own a pet is micro managing at it's finest - this is peoples LIVES we are controlling here. People don't just go to work to pay bills.. "
Improvement in attitudes to renters....
"As a Landlord with 25 years experience.---Tenants ALWAYS damage the property. The bond does not cover the basic repairs, let alone major damage. Tenants always ""live in"" the Bond, therefore leaving no money to cover, minor damage. Tenants cause substantial ($thousands) 7 out of 8 rentals agreement times."
"Improved time frames formvisists, and clarification of yard condition during tenancy and expectations to
Maintain in times of drought."
"Longer and more flexible timeframes to rectify any exit report breaches, allowing more of a reasonable effort for return on bond. "
Prevent deceitful and dishonest tenants from ripping off landlords.
"Being allowed pets (dogs particularly)
Twice a year inspections"
Clearer expectations for all parties around what is reasonable wear and tea particularly over longer tenancies and what is and isn't reasonable for landlords to expect be paid for when leaving a tenancy.
owner/tenant able to negotiate some conditions on lease that reflect specific issues to both parties. 
"I have a good rental agent now but prior to this all past rental agencies caused unnecessary grief. Repairs were never done, charged for full water rates when property was not water effecient. There are many agencies out there that are being dishonest. The only one I have found that is honest and does everything properly and looks after the tenant who is paying the rent is First National Real Estate and I have been fortunate to be in the same rental property with them for my fourth year."
Agents making unrealistic bond clean requirements. The houses need to look better than when you move in to get full bond released. And it has steadily gotten worse over the last 20 years.
"When I have moved into a property it is generally moderately clean, yet when I move out the agent expects it to be immaculate. There needs to be an equal standard here.

I have had issues getting routine maintenance done on all properties I have rented. Landlords are reluctant to spend money on things like: electrical problems (switched that are intermittent), water pumps for tanks that do not work, etc. There is no effective way for renters to escalate nor issues and get resolution.

In the current property I cannot get the owner to remove furniture they left behind. They expect me to store it or manage it and take responsibility if it is damaged."
"Less inspections once tenants have rented a property for a year and shown compliance with rental terms. Quarterly inspections are intrusive and unnecessary if a tenant has demonstrated compliance and should be limited to twice yearly. Generally  this is what is often done in other states of Australia from what I understand.
I feel also that illegal entry to properties by landlords and property managers should carry more accountability. 
Further I feel landlords should not be able to sell the rental property while tenanted unless absolutely necessary and the tenant should be compensated for the upheaval."
"The current laws make it to easy to allow for tenants to extract themselves from contracts/leases, refuse to honour contract/leases which results in time wasted in mediation or court ."
"Being able to treat the property as my own I agree with wanting to allow my pet inside as a member of the family or being able to hang pictures on the wall. We are told we can use temporary 3m hooks but after 3 years in our last rental they pulled paint off the wall and caused more damage than one small hook would have, our new house has zero hooks so we cannot hang anything."
The problem is people selling properties. This often ends a tenancy. and in the meantime leaves a feeling of insecurity. 
Clear set of rules/ checklist for house inspections instead of guessing what different realestate agents are looking for. E.g. one estate agent hated cat food left out for pets
"The rules around moving out. It costs so much money and landlords expect every ceiling and cm of wall to be cleaned. Also they expect bush in the backyard to be maintained, where it was never maintained in the first place. Also organising of people to inspect the house or fix something, we need more than 24 hours notice. And not just notice through the mail. Tenants should be able to say no if it’s unsuitable "
Have more houses in my price range that allow my cats
"In my current position I would like to have landlords respond to requests in a timely manner, with either a yes or no answer. In my case I took the liberty of replacing the deteriorated  and broken clothes line strands, and replacing the insect screen mesh on the back door, at my expense, only to be admonished for doing so, and this despite numerous requests for these simple repairs to be done over a two year period, and through 4 property managers from the same real estate company.  I am still waiting for written permission to hang pictures on the walls"
Less inspections after being there for 10 years
"Thought it was outrageous that I was asked to repaint an entire apartment, or loose all of my bond for affixing one picture hook in the wall. I ended up patching and painting the small hole, all at a cost of $5. I think it is unrealistic that people cannot make a house their home. However, I have also been a landlord who has had their apartment trashed, and on this occasion I could not easily evict the tenant who refused to pay rent for months on end. "
I can't think of anything as I'm very happy in my current rental property.
Ability to have pets more common
"Property managers need to be more responsive, knowledgeable and helpful to renters. If I was a property owner I would be horrified at the level of service provided by property managers for their fees. "
Real estate agents actually caring about tenants needs as well as owners
"The market is competitive and the turn around time is too quick. Owners should give tenants more credit, we are now in a time where people are renting for longer instead of buying, I treat my rental as my own home. "
"Ability to have animals freely with accountability directed at me to be responsible for cleaning and looking after the place I rent.
Furthermore, the ability to simply put up pictures. "
"Rental contracts need to be longer, knowing at the end of each year you may have to find somewhere new to live is stressful. Additionally, it took two years in our current property to get the back door fixed - it wouldn’t close meaning the property was constantly unsecured. This is ridiculous."
Property Managers being held accountable or easier access to get out of a Renting agreement if dissatisfied.
"Things getting fixed quicker, being able to hang photo frames up, being able to have outside pets. Communication be better"
"Competent agents who fulfil their duties in the best interest of both owner and tenant, and don't use their ""power"" to cause issues with the tenant if the tenant is making reasonable requests such as having working smoke alarms, fixing dangerous balcony railings, etc. and not using this against the tenant when they lease is renewed by increasing the rent by a large amount or being difficult upon leaving the rental property."
Making it easier to have pets while renting would be great
Rent a property from a real estate that will make the owner accountable for issues with the property and a landlord who is willing to spend money to fix the property 
More pleasant real estate emplyees
Ability to contact owner of home and deal directly with them.
Being able to secure furniture to the wall for my child’s safety
That we can hang pictures up and make it feel like home and be allowed to have pets 
"Tenancy agency. We have rented two properties, one by onsite managers and another by an agency. Our experience with onsite managers was much more positive. Our agency experience was anal about us ticking boxes but they ddin't have to adhere to standards themselves. "
"Prices need to be lower, it should be legislation that all rental properties be adequate with airconditioners in warmer climates with appropriate insulation. "
There is no maintance for the owner and then delayed and slow repairs
"Rental bonds and making it easier to access if you are moving to another rental. If you have had a good history in renting, being able to access 75% of your bond to assist with relocation 2-4 weeks ahead of moving (rather than waiting until after final inspection). Especially if you are using that money to get the premises you are leaving professionally cleaned etc."
Slightly cheaper rent payments 
The Owners to know what is happening on the property as the lack of communication between the Owner and the Real Estate is terrible
Timely repairs of broken househlod items
Service provided by all real estate agencies should be better.
Nothing really. My lanlords are great
It would improve my experience if owners and real estate agencies fulfilled maintenance requests in a reasonable amount of time. 
"The power-trip that some property managers like to exercise. Appreciate not all are like this but I have had property managers who have threatened TICA listings to get their way. They are in a position of power with the ability to threaten the roof over your head so most renters will comply for fear of losing their 'home'.
Better CRMs for Property Managers so that repair and maintenance requests don't fall through the cracks
More guarantees for renters that repair and maintenance requests will be followed through by the owner in a timely manner"
"More security in your lease (e.g. the inability for a property owner to sell a property once a lease has been initiated, or within the first third of a lease)."
"Individual leases for multiple occupants so they can be held accountable for the financial stress they cause when they move out before the lease ends. Maybe the ability to make some minor changes to the property, for example putting up pictures."
The ability to have longer leases eg 5 years
Better investment to maintaining the rental property by realestate and home owners.
Reasonable price in rent and further training for real estate agents
The discriminating attitude from Property Managers to tenants.  I believe we are all pigeon-holed by Property Managers who treat tenants like inferiors.
"Being able to make the property a home.
Being able to hang pictures on walls and being able to have the ability to choose to have a family pet or not.
Also after being in the property for over 2yrs we shouldn't have to be subject to inspections every 3 mths. Once a yr would be fine"
The cost increases when you are at the limit of affordability.
longer leases for proven tenants 
Landlords/property managers to be more responsive to issues reported.
"Landlords need to be required to ensure hot water systems are set up to separate electricity meters not set up on main meter which does not allow for hot water to be switched to a lower tariff. 
Inspections to be taken back to 6 months not 3months. 
Have ability to pay rent through bank not be forced to pay monthly fees for having to use 3rd party payment schemes like RE Connect"
"Better communication with the landlord, or even an email specially designed to speak with the owner."
Owners wait for too long to start fixing problems with the property...seems to be you can wait until I feel like fixing the problem rather than getting it done.
Lower prices for modern premises
Tougher penalties for tenants and owners who do the wrong thing. 
"Greater flexibility in moving/breaking lease options. When I last moved, despite giving a months notice I was stuck paying rent until the next tenant moved in as I still had 2 months on my lease. Was expensive paying 2x rent as a single person on top of all the other costs involved with moving"
Clearer definitions of fair wear & tear and greater accountability of rental agents. Tenants should not be at fault for property manager incompetence. 
Allow more rentals too have pets... A lot of people are lonely and their pet is everything to them.
"Ability to make minor cosmetic modifications (for instance, hang paintings and the like) without needing to seek / obtain consent from landlord. "
"The high rents for a pensioner,NOT matched by the Centrelink housing allowance NOT keeping up with rental increases over the years"
"1. Agents especially can become rude and non professional at the end of the lease.
2. RTA is not a authorized body to make decisions rather than a priestly service to hear things with no real authority. This leads to wastage of time in dealing with my dispute about bond return and have to go to QCAT for real actionable decisions. This waiting is misused by almost all agents."
"'- Availability of longer-term leases to provide additional security in markets where it's often expensive to buy
- More protections against spurious claims by landords/agents on bond refunds
- Allowance of pets at property subject to certain conditions being met
"
"I would prefer not to pay someone else to live in my home.  I would love to own a home, however it is unaffordable to pay rent and save enough for a deposit.  I keep a very clean and tidy home for my family, property managers are always commenting on how lovely it is.  I have been in the same property for 5 years and yet the inspections still occur every 3 months.  I would like to see this reduced to every six months based on prior inspections and condition of the house."
"I have only rented 2 properties so far. The first was through Horizon Housing which was terrible and they are not the nicest to deal with. The second was through Ray white and was a house which allowed pets, the owner is very nice and we have 2 dogs. We struggled a lot trying to find a house that would allow animals. Please please PLEASE make it easier for pet owners to rent without discrimination from the owner. Not everyone that has animals destroys a house, PLUS you take it from the bond anyway so I don't understand why people are so harsh against pet owners."
Abolish 'no grounds' evictions
Drop the price of rent 
I would like to not be discriminated for having pets and have access to all housing.
"Although a difficult issue to fix through legislation, rental agency and real estate culture, particularly in regard to attitude toward current and prospective tenants, needs serious improvement. The agencies expectation of tenants, throughout my experience, have been considerable and demanding with a demand for quick resolution, whilst if a situation arises in which the tenant has a matter that needs to be solved quickly by the agent or landlord, the response will more likely than not be less than satisfactory and drag on for far longer than necessary. Rent increases, repairs, inspections, etc. are all undertaken with a blasé attitude, often with little consideration that the property is the tenant's home and personal space and is treated rather as a impersonal building that operates between 9 - 5 or whenever the property manager is available. Whilst tenants should be informing themselves of rules, regulations and being clear as to what is within their tenancy agreement, real estate agencies use the 'Special Conditions' section of the lease agreement to put whatever they see fit into, often without explaining the section or its contents. Rental agents themselves often also seem to be completely unaware as to what rental law and regulation is, but the culture permits this as acceptable. "
quicker bond return or being able to transfer bond between properties when you move
"Tougher timeframes on tenants - the process of having a tenant evicted when they have done the wrong thing is very time consuming, it can take months and in that time they don't pay rent, there is nothing that can be done about it.  Insurances don't always have the owners back in situations like this."
"Property Managers need a better understanding of the law as it overarches the RTRAA and although the ""Landlord is the client"" there is a definite culture of bullying tenants and wearing them down in my experience personally and of others."
"More owners be open to pets. It can be hard to find nice places, in nice areas that are pet friendly."
Property managers are either under-skilled or overwhelmed.  I would like to see a more equal balance of relationship between property managers and tenants.
"Flexibility with furnishings and increase security e.g. peephole in door, video intercom rather than just phone."
More flexibility around inspection times and leases for good renters
"No sense of rights, unable to live as if its a home, constant 3 monthly inspections even though we have been excellent tenants for 4 years, not allowed to home a family pet"
The difficulty of leaving the rental property. The real estate expects the house to be left in mint condition or you wont get your bond back.
Make rent prices more affordable! It’s way too expensive!
"More reasonable inspections -- having a housing inspection every three months, conducted by a random staff member we've never met, is intrusive and invades our privacy. I can understand frequent inspections for sharehouses etc, where people might damage the property, but when we've been living in our place long-term and have never damaged anything, an inspection every three months is too much."
more affordable and available rental properties for seniors
Better property exit process
Unjustified rental price increase each renewal of the lease agreement (every 12 months)
"The agents work for the home owner, so you always feel judged and rated.  And never get to feel secure."
Better contact rules with real estate agents. Agents in the last have taken too long to respond to requests for maintenance which has affected our living conditions
More places allowing bigger dogs
Allows small pet
"As a tenant - nothing, I am satisfied.

As a landlord - I don't want to be out of pocket when a tenant changes their mind and breaks lease.  Feels as if any compromise has to be on the landlords part rather than the tenant.  Bias towards tenants at conciliation and QCAT.  Even when the tenant is in clear breach of the law and lease they often have rulings in their favour.  Damage to a property (outside of fair wear and tear) is skewed towards the tenant - if they burn a section of the carpet then they are only responsible for repairing that section and not the entire room which must be done to make proper repair."
More pet friendly homes 
"Ease of application, greater affordability, better quality homes available, real estate industry as gatekeepers, greater flexibility to make changes to rental property, ability to have pet, inspection process is time consuming and inconvenient. "
"All tenants should be allowed at least one cat or dog (taking into account appropriate/relative size of pets to said accommodation) before having to go through the gruelling and usually disappointing approval process. With animal shelters full and many people hesitating to adopt due solely to the fact they are afraid of being denied a tenancy due to having a pet, this is an issue we need to change."
More effective pathways for dealing with maintenance issues within the rental property that result in quicker repair times for jobs.
Allow pets and less inspections. Tenents deserve privacy. 
"Allowing pictures to be put up, gardening/planting. "
have stronger legislation to support tennants with dispute resolution
Allow for more pet friendly properties 
Response time when requesting maintenance 
"We rented for the first time in December last year. I inspected the home twice before we signed the papers and it was in good condition. The day we were given the keys we went to the home. It was dirty, it hadn’t had a pest control and the curtains and blinds were dusty as were the tops of shelves and the cabinets in the kitchen. We just had to put up with it and clean it ourselves. We also had to get a pest control within the first month as it was evident that one was not performed prior to us moving in. The carpets where immaculate though. We are due to move out in December as the owners wish to sell the home. We are expected to have the home bond cleaned, a pest control done, the air conditioning vents cleaned, the carpets cleaned and yet this was not the same condition we found the home... you should be able to leave the home in the same state as how you found it..."
The choice to have long term leases like Europe does.  Being able to have Pets and make a home rather than a temporary dwelling e g pictures and curtains etc. Not being treated like a second class citizen
Less inspections and maintenance needs to be done within a time limit
Cheaper rents of course though current rents I don't think are too bad
"More emphasis on the quiet enjoyment of the property I am renting. 
At the moment, the way the legislation is implemented, I have inspections every quarter where people walk through my property disregarding no shoes policy and making comments on changing the curtains and genersl improvements. When I ask for remedial action, it is a completely different story. This is seen as an inconvenience and sometimes to the extent that I am lying. The landlord and agent seem to be able to do what they want and get away with it. I have little recourse. Talking the the rent authority and taking action on their recommendations is basically a waste of time. "
Break lease fees 
"The uncertainty of length tenancy.  As a long-term renter, when you find a suitable property with a good owner, but still not knowing at the end of each 12 month period if you are going to have to find somewhere else."
"Many property managers do not have an interest is balanced protection of tenant or landlord, seem to be one way or other depending on the person."
Faster actioning of repair requests
"The rental prices need to reduce. 
If a mark on the wall was done by accident - landlord insurance needs to be consulted to reduce cost to tenant (as it was an accident)"
"Less power of landlords & rental managers over bond repairs and ""wear and tear"" type problems"
"Being scared to move and line up with 25 more applicants to get in to another property Plus a varied number of rental agreements from agent to agent The agreements should be standardised....
Plus NRAS is a Joke if you’re on the pension you as a single person don’t qualify so long term rentals are a farce .."
I would like to be able to place wall hangings for home decor to give it that homely feel 
"Centrally held or shared rating system for tenants, landlords and property managers. This would would mean that each would have information about the other prior to entering a tenancy agrrangement. This may improve accountability of all stakeholders to one another. Data entered would have to be backed up with evidence in the case of negative feedback."
Digitise bond lodgement ... properly ... not just scanning and sending in forms by email
"Longer rental terms
If first year 3mthly inspections are all ok, extend the length between inspections. Also CONSULT with tenant and get input for inspections. IE NOT school pickup/drop off times."
need more affordable housing for low income families
The length of leases - they are far too short. Renters need some kind of stability. Leases need to be a minimum of 2 years with options for 5 and 10 years. This is functioning perfectly well in Europe. At the moment the market is designed to serve only the landlord and renters live in a permanent state of instability and uncertainty.
Do not increase the amount of paperwork for both parties. I think it's pretty spot on the way it is.
Allow tenant to make the house a home having gardens hang paintings and photos on walls. Not allowing agents to take photos and videos of the house ones occupies. 
"The intrusiveness of the process, the demeaning attitude displayed by most renting agents and the game playing when applying for properties. "
Allowing pets in rentals by size/breed. 
"I’d request the after the initial 2 x 3 monthly inspections, should of the real estate be satisfied, I’d like those inspections to be every 6 months minimum for long term tenants with good tenancy history."
Mandatory allowance of pets
"The ability to hang things on the walls (e.g. art/photographs), longer term tenancies, more flexibility around pet ownership. "
"I feel that tenants have little opportunity to make their rental properties a place to call 'home'. They aren't authorised to make minor adjustments to the property (can't even hang family photographs), often can't have pets and the inspection process feels quite invasive. "
Make the application process easier and allow more privacy of information for the tenant.
Genuine Reason for termination by Owner
Houses need to have a complete go over by owners before new long term tenets move in. So many times we have moved into a property that we have had to clean first inzide and out.
Stop rent from going up when you sign a new lease..that you don't have credit check when putting someone on lease as occupant
Not having to use a rental payment system that costs us extra money just to pay our rent
"one thing???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Pets no longer needing permission, just give us the terms of leaving and let us keep our pets."
the option to purchase the property if and when it goes on the market.
"Be able to have more security regarding length of lease- not have to move every 12 months due to property being sold or owner wanting to move back in, increase rent etc."
"Increase the availability of affordable housing as well as mandatory classes for all property managers for customer service as the treatment of Tennant from property managers and landlords is disgusting 90% of the time. If your looking for a property in the bracket affordable low end market you are treated like scum and cattle from the get go and expected to feel lucky that you were accepted to live on a property instead of like a human being. Tennants are so afraid of being black listed or defamed by real estates that we cannot even report issues with properties without fear of retaliation of having a black mark against your name. While real estates can be the worst and there is no safe way to report them without them possibly putting you on a nuisance list for all real estates to see. Meanwhile the real estate and landlord are overcharging for properties and as tenants we end up paying their mortgage yet cannot afford to save for our own when a property is brought for $155,000 body corporate fees are $3300 a year and your rent for that property is $280 a week it's clear you pay for it all and yet a landlord can refuse to fix the mould on the property because it costs $2500 but still expects you to pay your rent even after being breached multiple times! Then has the cheek to raise your rent more to cover the repairs? Australia is heading for a housing crisis that much is incredibly obvious and you don't need a survey to see that! "
Make long term renting more viable through making laws and regulations better for renters. At the moment most rules and body corporate laws are geared towards investors rather than renters or owner occupiers. 
Better communication with real estate regarding issues such as repairs
Owners taking better care of their properties.
The ability to transfer bond prior to moving from one property to another.  It is an expensive and stressful time moving a family.  Having to come up with the Bond money can sometimes be hard.  If your existing Registered Bond was able to be used to put up to secure a property it would help the stress and financial hardship of coming up with the monies. 
Tenants should be allowed to have pets.
Landlord responsibility and reliability
Allow us to put up picture frames on the wall
Real Estate Agents made more accountable
"There is already too much pressure to manage properties effectively under state laws. too many lop sided rules which actually favor the tenants. Tenants have the Office of fair trading or the RTA to complain about agents but agents or landlords have nobody who can act for them in matters caused by tenants, including defamation, public nuisance, trespass, vandalizing agent property or vehicles, intentional reckless endangerment and many other matters. Tenants are favored by the RTA and the RTA should not give any tenant information over the phone until they have spoken to the agent or landlord first.          "
I would be able to hang pictures on the walls.
"Quicker repairs, less inspections, "
Allowance of pets into rental properties 
The cost to live in redlands is unfair. It is impossible to save for a home deposit with children and paying rent. 
"I paid $120 at the magistrates court to take my rental agency and owner to Qcat.  I was not notified of the court date and subsequently missed it.  I was told I'd have to pay another $120 to rebook.  I never, ever received notice of the court date, my letter box is locked and cannot be tampered with."
More protection for renters and no smoking in unit complexes
Make smoking in multi unit properties illegal for the health of all tenants who have to put up with smoking tenants polluting the common areas and second hand smoke entering their units.
Centrelink tenant's rent to be non cancelable from benefits for the term of the lease
Having informed and ethical property managers
More accountability re dodgey tenants.
"Allow bond to be transferred regardless of agent or property - when you have to move (through no fault of your own) and you have to save a new bond on top of moving costs it's tough, especially when you have bond money already lodged."
Being able to save up money.
"I am concerned that tenants are viewed as second class citizens. I am renting as the tax rules make purchase prohibitively expensive,  despite being had hunted from abroad top fill a vacancy that could not be filled from within the country. I have looked at property for sale and that to rent. I am conscious of being treated differently by real estate agents in the two sectors"
Having repairs done in a reasonable time
"It is difficult to negotiate with a rental owner through a property manager.  The property manager is there to support the rental owner's interests.  There is no-one to support the tenant other than the RTA.  If the tenant turns to the RTA for support the owner sees this as utilising the ""big stick"" approach.  Some owners are just not willing to maintain their properties to a reasonable standard but still expect to be able to demand current market rents due to market demand.  As a lessor it is difficult to then motivate the owner to upgrade or undertake necessary maintenance without the owner increasing the rental price.

The rental support received from Centrelink in the order of approximately $140 per fortnight is nowhere near realistic in assisting against rentals which are in the order of $360 per week.  Centrelink assistance needs to be in tune more with current rental models."
"A bit more freedom to have plant pots, pictures, small pets.
I’d also like to make sure that propriety owners have insurance or that this information is properly disclosed and the impacts of the owner not having insurance could  impact the tenants. 
Managers bend the rules a lot and private land lords can be horrible in driving passed to check on things without a notice. There is a power imbalance and that needs to be addressed. When there is a power imbalance there is always people who will use that power to abuse those with less power. Renting doesn’t mean we a less. "
Affordability. It is really hard to find reasonably affordable accommodation that can cater for my family and is close to both work and study.
"The three monthly inspections to six monthly, as it feels a little invasive. "
"Make housing more secure, by removing the ‘without reason’ for asking a tenant to vacate a rental property."
Lots places won’t let you have pets an when u prove you good tenant they still know co you back. They tar everyone with same brush not fair
"1. Rental agencies to have less control - they demand things unneccessary- like paying to clean an already clean house. 
2. RTA to be more approachable and actually responding to complaints."
Allowing my dogs to live with our family as they have not been allowed and had to stay with my parents until we move out . Also emails don’t get replied to when we ask for our ledger or paid to date as we pay in bulk amounts we have gone into arrears without knowing for a period of 2 weeks without getting any communication what so ever it was rectified straight away but there is just no communication. 
"Changing inspections to one every 6 months to allow for more privacy as opposed to the current every 3 months where agents often try to gain access under the 3 month limit between inspections. Also pets would be nice as when you buy a home you can’t guarantee no pets lived there, same should be with rentals as long as care is taken to look after the property."
Clearer definitions of responsibilities and wording of the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accomodation Act
rent going up every time I renew the lease
"Starting with the rental Agency , and owners."
"As a landlord we have had nothing but problems with tenants paying rent.  This needs to be fixed as the current process is the tenant doesn't pay rent, then they have to be issued with a breach notice and given 7 days to remedy.  Then if they don't pay rent you then issue a Notice to leave and give another 7 days.  Then if they still haven't paid rent you need to go to QCAT to obtain a warrant of possession.  The end result is the 4 weeks bond is almost gone in unpaid rent as a landlord further expenditure is incurred in issuing the relevant paperwork and obtaining a warrant. The end result is the tenants move out, all the bond is taken if unpaid rent and then property is not cleaned etc. as the normal part of the vacating a property.  This has happened on 4 occasions to us.  The tribunal is ineffective as they make an order in favour of which is not enforceable unless we pursue the matter through legal channels.  So far we are owned more than $30 000 for damage to our property and unpaid rent never recovered.  Not to mention the time and emotional coast.  When are decent hardworking property owners going to get a fair go."
Making real estate agents tell the truth about a property and making sure the owners fix things in a timley manner like in a few weeks not 12 months and still expect you to pay full water bill when they have not fixed the water problem in 12 months . To fix a door which becomes a fire hazard and don't say no to it .and you cant go to the rta cause you will get evicted for a stupid reason or not get a chance to rent again
"Stop landlords from being able to end your lease so easily - in our case the landlord sold and the new owner wanted to move in, but we were happy in that home and didn't want to have to move."
"stop third parties such as RENTPAY charge money for me paying rent.
It should be paid by agencies as it helps them to reduce workload.
They do offer other forms of payment such as cash ( means i have to drive 30min to the office each week)

"
More security and stability - if meeting renting obligations and committed to long term tenancy they should have the option for long term lease (ie. 1 year lease to lease does not provide much stability especially if the owner wishes to move back in to property - law is weighed in owners favor).
"Bond- There needs to be a way that when you go from one place to another you are able to transfer the Bond from the previous address to the new one.  You can not expect for struggling families to come up with thousands of dollars to clean the old house, moving costs and fork out a new bond.  It is just to hard."
"Longer notice periods to vacate (8 weeks) and if being advised to vacate, you can opt to leave earlier than 8 weeks (2 weeks notice). Rent cannot be increased by more than 5% or CPI per year. Maintanence issues can be fixed by tenant and charged to letting agent if request not actioned within 3 business days for urgent issues such as leaking taps, broken hot water, electrical failure."
"First option to buy, sell with consideration of rent paid as deposit; plus rent equivalent to 100% of mortgage payment is unfair and should be no more than 45% of mortgage payments. 

At QCAT tenants have no legal support, and yet agents act for owners. "
Set rules on house inspections instead of outrageous expectations of show room clean homes
Being able to hang pictures and photos to make it more homely. Without feeling like I’m a burden or risk not having my lease renewed. 
If repairs were completed quickly rather than having to wait for quite a while sometimes.
"1. Rental prices must be regulated by the council. 
2. Pets must be allowed. 
3. Hanging of photos on the wall must be allowed. 
4. Citizens who have been renting for more than 5 years must be subsidized by the government, so they can save to buy a house. "
Simple process for dispute 
More pet friendly renrals.
Education for landlords and tenants 
"The advertising on 99% of homes is misleading, camera angles, using photos from when it was new, nit what it is now, the general state of some of them etc. Also if you want a long lease to avoid that uncertainty every year, it is hard to get"
"More freedom around what you can do in a rental, including hanging paintings, having pets. etc. "
Able pets to be accepted in every rental property
"Make Tenants give same two months notice to vacate.
Let us have a level playing field."
Ensuring that landlords fix issues when they arise
Ability to sign a longer lease 
Higher level of accountability and transparency from property managers. 
"The style of accomodation for people on a budget. Apartment living is awful, buildings are budget made with poor materials that are not sound proof and rights of peace and quiet are abolished. "
"I would like there to be more rights in place for the tenant. Too many times I have ""put up with"" problems/concerns within the household out of fear of being ""annoying"" to the landlord who has made me feel like I am asking/expecting too much (and that the rent 'will have to go up' if I keep asking for things to be fixed). "
"Longer leases and less frequent inspections. I think once you have shown yourself to be a good tenant whom looks after the property, I think inspections should be reduced. Every 12 weeks is too often. "
"The approach to tenancy renewals. My agent requires a tenancy renewal to be lodge 2 months prior to the end of the current tenancy agreement. So, I receive the renewal application 3 months prior to the end with typically 1 week or when negotiated 2 weeks to return the renewal application.

The explanation provided is that this is a legislated requirement.

This does not allow applicants to investigate options available. As a renter, you feel pressured into signing to ensure you have a roof over your head. As it can be costly to move, especially when there is a rent increase associated with the renewal."
That renters with pets are not ostracised just because they own animals. All rental properties should be able to accept pets. 
Although tenants have a right to make the house a home - I fear that Landlords feel their property and their rights are ignored when it comes to some legislation and QCat
Quicker responses from landlords/agents
"Cost of renting. 
I applied for NRAS and was refused because I didn't have enough income! So I was forced to rent through a real estate agent, costing $560pw!! 
Come December I will loose parenting payment and only recieve $1000pftn feom centrelink. I have studied and have a job paying an average of $400pftn- trying to get more work. Single parent with 4 young kids! Its ridiculous!!"
"Dealing with Rental agents/landlords . We cannot get hold of our Agent during the weekend, UNLESS it is urgent (i.e., a leak, or electrical fault). If there is a problem with other tenants parking (we live in a small apartment complex (4 apartments), or other issue, we have to wait until week days to speak to them.  We need work done on the area outside the back and side of our unit, due to flooding, the Agents have been very efficient in trying to get the landlord to do something, but nothing has been done (11 months).  Our apartment complex is only 2 years old.  Appointments have been made for the landlord to look, but twice, he has not kept the appointments.  We keep our apartment in immaculate condition."
There are a lot of bad property managers working for real estates.
Breach periods need to be shortened back to the same as rental arrears. 
Increased access restriction of the landlord onto tenanted property
"I believe there is not enough light shed on the requirements regarding the lease contract. The owners of rental properties think it's a great way to make money but forget that whilst they have a tenant living in the home it is their job as the owner to ensure the property is maintained to an appropriate living standard. The thing I would change is to ensure the landlord and their chosen property manager are aware of the laws and requirements, that they are fair and reasonable. I think there needs to be more support for tenants living in homes that are not kept well maintained, living in a house that is not up to scratch yet requesting maintenance that does not happen is extremely stressful. Moving from one rental to another with a family of young children is a stressful and financially turbulent experience. "
Remove the discrimination against pets
All rentals to allow pets
"Less restriction on what I can do as a tenant. I feel like I have little control over what happens with regards to inspections (timing of inspections), modifying the house to my liking (picture hooks), pet ownership or body corporate affairs."
"Easier completion/ signing of lease documents.  I suggest allowing electronic/digital signatures for signing of lease documents to stop the necessity for printing, signing, scanning and emailing a lease renewal.

Also removing the need for a witness signature."
"The laws need to look after the tenant for safety, health and well being. The agents have to much power and can destroy your history for no apparent reason other than a personal vendetta "
Too much power has been vested with the real estate agents and the owners. Things should be balanced
"Greater options for Tenant's to take action when Property Managers/Owners refuse to basic maintenance or repairs to a rental property. In my current rental property, at one stage I was without hot water for 5 months (during winter). The owner refused to have the issue addressed, incorrectly blamed us for damage to the hot water system (the system is old, not damaged), then tried to pass on 1/2 of the cost for repairs to us (the tenants). This instance was not the first, or last example of maintenance issues which have been difficult to resolve. "
"Rental prices are way too high..even in established area for older homes..now out of control..as an older single working person , I pay $450 per week ..half my wage..the house I lived in before this one was over 20 years old 3 bedrooms , no aircon in Nerang with hot summers and the house was intiallly purchased for $50,000.. no improvements made ..just changed hands but real estate agents bumping up prices stating its where you live!!! Lets get real.. Homelessness will be real if this is not addressed...more so when you enhance the property with plants, mowing at tenants expense , there is no reduction in rent for being a great tenant , rather its WOW! this is great your paying too little for this property..A rent increase!!
Hang On! I did this! I improved this as if it were my home...but if there's a problem and I need a repair..slow in coming and HELLO! An increase again to manage the repair..Agents DO NOT CARE ABOUT TENANTS RIGHTS!!!"
As a landlord I think it should be compulsory to set up automatic bank payment deductions so the tenants are never late with payments and the bank should contact the landlord if anything changes with the auto payments.
"Reduce the routine inspections, every 3 months is annoying especially when the agent can see the property is immaculate "
"After renting 37/2 a Townhouse at Coomera for 12 years and taking care of small maintenance jobs, fly screens, leaking taps and replacing shower roses,  and repairing ground settlement cracks to plaster walls, and my rent was always upfront and paid on time,  I had paid in rent to the Owners over $246,000 Ref: the Manager Mr Paul Targett of Coomera Landing I was not paid my rental bond of $1400-00 into my NAB account, my form was filled out and presented to the Manager mid to end of July 2018, I had also given in writing my intention to vacate the unit to both the Owners and the Manager, on the grounds that the Owners contacted me and told me they had listed the unit for sale, I told the owners in that conversation that I would look for another home and they (Michael Basford) said to me we would like it to be sooner not later and thanked me for being a good tenant, I found a house to move to and advised them of my move out date of 30th July 2018, I kept on checking with the Manager for a reply from the Owners and he advised me that they were going to charge me each week the unit was on the market being sold. I felt I had done everything to assist them in selling their unit by vacating at that date, R/Estate Agents had been and taken pictures with my furniture and personals still in the unit
I am a pensioner and not having my bond returned made it very difficult to put funds together for my new home but struggled and made it, I feel I don't owe the owners any money, having paid for professional cleaners and carpet cleaner once I had moved to clean the premisses. "
Inspection issues for tenants. Inspections are invasive for tenants but necessary for owners. 
Tenants and property owners should meet prior to rental agreement so that both parties know who they are dealing with instead working through a third party property manager who does not have either parties interest as a priority.
Adjust the bond ammount held to cover tenants that do not pay.
The rules seem very skewed in the tenant's favour. This needs to become more balanced.
Have appropriate training & qualifications for property managers at real estates
"Agents responding to maintenance requests faster
Methods of payment "
Set a maximum three month lease. 
"Owners need to be more accountable for general wear and tear on the property with regular maintanance.
"
Being able to have longer tenancy agreements. Being able to hang paintings without permission.
"Longer lease
Landlords to make all repairs in a timely manner
Real estate agents to be more accountable
Being able to have pets"
Affordable renting for low income and pensioners
"Power imbalance between RE agents and tenants- tenants are more than often  in a position of ""do what you are told"" for fear of reprisal. Greater tenure, with regards to long term rental agreements ie; 5 years or more similar to European models.
"
The right to owning a pet. The right to hang pictures. The right to add security features such as screen doors and surveillance cameras.
"More protections for tenants, it's well known that our current system was designed with the idea in mind that most Australian's would be able to buy a house. This is no longer realistic for most Australians, as such the entire system should be reformed to provide greater protection to tenants."
"The communication from the Real Estate Agent is poor, disjointed, plainly wrong at times and rude/unprofessional at times"
Allowed our pets n not have to say goodbye to them.especially having many Yrs..n not having to pay there water rates..n have things fixed straight away..n security screensn doors..n smoke alarms checked.. Be fair about wear n tear..giving back when we improve there house out of own pocket
"There should be something in place for reliable renters where they can have the option to get an approved home loan without a big deposit and regardless of their current employment, but instead, based on their rental history and the amount of rent paid so that way instead of lining someone elses pockets we could own our own home and pay it off by paying our rent to the home loan. It would be a dream come true as i worry for the future of my children. I believe everyone who does the right thing and keeps a very positive rental record deserves the option to own their own home.
Please consider something like this for queensland. 
We have been in the rental market for 11 years now and have always been great tenants and treated the property as much as possible like it was our own. Their are a few things that really bother me even though our property managers have always been lovely. 
First is the invasive house inspections. We have them twice a year though it should be once per year as they know by now how much we look after the property so checking in on us should be at the complete minimum after they see the pattern over a couple of years... 
The second issue i have is the yearly rent increases. It's just getting ridiculous to the point that we are struggling bur cant find a cheaper rental that's decent for our standard of living. Its too much of a stuggle for the long term.
The third issue I have is having to pay such high rent and then on top of the forever climbing rent increases we have to pay our own water usage too.
Considering the price of water and electricity these days, rent should not increase once you sign a lease in any property unless new tenants are vacating the property as it's really becoming so hard to survive like this...
My last issue is how hard it is to find rentals that apprive pets in queensland. It makes it so hard to move as your pets are part of the family and you should never have to give them up to keep a roof over your head. I would love more pet approved rentals."
I have had some bullying from 1 member of the body corporate. 
Prices of properties are high in Brisbane and agents tend to increase everytime the lease is renewed regardless of whether it is warranted or not
My current place is good but the Realeastate I dealt with before hand were bad they took so long to get in contact with 
Clearer expectations of 'fair wear and tear.' Property managers looking to take as much from tenants' bonds as possible.
Actually being able to treat the property as my own i.e. hang pictures on the wall - all be it with care and respect
The ability for landlords to use their insurance to repair item that are damaged due to accidents. 
After a certain period of time property inspections every 3-4 months should cease 
Land lords and real estate agents need to be held accountable for maintenance much more strictly. 
"Joint and several liability: puts individual tenants at increased an unnecessary risk. 

"
The worst experiences I’ve had is when owners don’t use a property manager 
Currently there no repurcuasions for real estate trying to take bond and failing. It is a win/draw scenario for real estates whereas it’s a draw/lose scenario for the renter due to stress/time lost to dispute the claim. Sometimes it’s eaaier to settle and move on then dispute the claim further as the payout is less then the time to continue the dispute. Some checks on the legitimacy of bond claims lodged my real estates should exist or a negative incentive added if the real estates loose the dispute to ensure all claims they lodge are valid with evidence rather then inconvenience the renter until they settle to end the inconvenience 
Protection of tenants when dealing with QCAT/RTA
The ability to bring my pets without discrimination as well as being discriminated for being a young professional and getting treated terrible and being bullied by agents and owners. 
"There are two types of tenants that break or request a break in the rent Agreement. Those who are ""runners"" or found negligent in complying with the terms and conditions in any way, these are peole who should have the full force of the law brought down on them to protect a landlords property. The second type are people who require to terminate are those that for legitimate reasons such as loss of employment therefore reducing the income level, people who for medical and or other physical reasons  and those who may be financially able to purchase a new home, these people should be considered with some leniency and reduce the mental and financial burden when terminating early."
"The restriction on having pets, especially dogs, having to be outside only pets. 
The amount of inspections conducted on a rental property is very instrusive especially when the owner continually accompanies the agent as well. Is it so necessary to have so many inspections a year when they already know the that the tenant is a person who is looking after the property?"
"Not alot of places that are pet friendly. Alot of places that i have left they seems to be working more in the interests of the owner rather than the tenants. Seems like every property manager or rental agency seems to try and claim the maximum amount of bond back even if you leave the property in good order or better than you arrived in.

Alot of issues with trying to get anything fixed, it took me 6  months to get a water leaking issue fixed we could not use the bathroom for months as it was causing a leak and in turn mould growing. 

Also had to take another agency to the QCAT as they did not fix a leak for over a year the carpet was mouldy and said they would replace it and then backflipped and stated in the court they never said that, seems to me the PM & rental agencies need to be more accountable.

And going to the RTA literaly does nothing, one of the PM's actually said to me they ignore any form 6 until the tenants leave they just don't care."
"Bring in laws to control Real Estate Agents behaviour, I have lived in one house for 8 years they have over 4000 photos of this house gathered during house inspections. Every 1/4 during house inspection they discuss how ""Ive lost my bond""....the bond is the prize...!!"
Better spacing between arranged entry to the home. I seem to have a had a lot of entry required lately in a short space of time. More opportunities to view properities outside of work hours. 
"For real estate agents whom act on behalf of owners to also remember that tenants are their customers too and deserve the same level of service.
That the condition of no pets at properties was lessened as it can sometimes make someone with a perfect rental history - but with dogs - challenged with a difficult task of finding a place. "
Sell my rental property.
"For those who are long standing ""good, clean, pay on time tenants"" the inspections should be reduced. For the ones who are bad payers, are dirty, leave premises in absolute messes, there should be much better access to being able to list them on the ""Bad Tenancy Lists"" and also have much easier access, to check on ""potential renters"" before allowing them to rent a property you may own."
After a certain time renting the inspections to be cut down to once every six months
More communication and input into the place I rent
"I am on a pension. Even with rent assistance there is not much left after paying $310 per week.  I would make renting more affordable for lower income earners. NRAS houses are affordable, however they are few and far between in my area and the few that are available are in suburbs I would not feel comfortable living in. "
Being allowed to have a pet. I had to sign an agreement not to allow my dog inside even though she’s elderly and blind. 
Criteria for acceptable renters
More freedom to hang things or attach furniture to walls for safety
"Less intrusion. I have been renting the same property for over 9 years, and have passed every inspection with flying colours, but I am still subject to an inspection every 3 months on the dot."
Permission to have dogs in ALL properties. 
"Renters are treated as children with no rights at the mercy of owners.
2013 at where I had lived for 10 years balcony floor collapsed under me fell 4 mts spinal damage owner never did repairs that were listed at inspections had to sue owner and agents.
R never allowed pets and if a single mum very difficult to get rental property."
When a renter has three years continuous rental with the one landlord without any serious issues they are refunded fifty per cent of the bond money.  The remaining fifty per cent stays until the lease is terminated.
Lower rents..being on a disability pension..more than half is gone in rent.
"Having some say over management of outside spaces - I signed a lease for a house because of the green leafy garden, then went to move in and they'd cut all the trees down. Coming into summer with two young children this shade and outside space was the key reason I rented the otherwise run-down house. I was totally misled. The owners didn't care, they don't live there."
"All properties are pets allowed (if the property is able to have the amenities i.e. has a backyard), more support for renters who get their property sold while they are under a lease - for example, the ability to terminate the lease without any financial penalty etc, water should be included as a standard, even up to a minimum amount. Bond should be returned ALOT faster, especially when the real estate agent is being purposefully slow with releasing it. And we should be able to transfer bond to properties, so if we have to move then the new property being able to just accept a bond transfer from the RTA because having to front up with the money (especially if unexpected due to owner selling) for the new property is extremely expensive and just more burdensome for the tenant. "
The landlord is reluctant to commit to repairs that are required
"Property managers (real estate agents mostly) are gouging on there fees (up to 8.5% of the rent).
This cost is inevitably passed onto the renter as the landlord has to make a reasonable return.
This is pushing up the cost of rent.
Rental management fees  should be limited to 5.5% and the savings passed back to the rentor.
"
Notification when the real estate changes the our Property Manager.
Reduce the number of rental properties I have to reduce my risks.
Longer term leases and no discrimination about pet ownership.
Stop picking on the general wear and tear that happens. No house will be the same as it was built after living in it for a few years.
Many houses we looked at were listed as 'pet friendly' but the yards weren't safe or fully fenced.  The term 'pet friendly' needs more clarity.
"as a property manager we think it would be helpful if when calling the RTA a case number was given to both property manage,r owner and tenant so that we can correlate the information that we are being told with all parties.  At present tenants recall one version of events compared to property managerrs version which causes issues.
We also think tenants and owners should have the same notice to vacate, ie 6 weeks on both side, rather than tenant 2 weeks and owner 2 month"
find a way to make rental managers responsible for what goes on as it is they have no responsibility but all the power 
More freedom to make the property my home.
I asked about putting up pitcher when i signed the lease i was not answered annoying 
Better communication and dispute resolution approaches by parties 
Allow pets more frequently. Stop judging by a person's means of income.
Restrict period of renewal notification from the landlord to perhaps six weeks. Currently open ended and I received my notice of offer to renew 6 months before my end of tenancy. This is no good for planning especially if you are looking for another property. In the rental market you cannot secure a property six months out from a end of lease so this tactic forces you to renew or take a risk of being homeless.
Being able to transfer bonds from one premise to another. NSW allows this why not QLD?
"Prevent owners from deciding to sell half way through the first year of tenancy (having already spent $1000+ to move and enduring the pain of finding a place and packing your life into boxes) then having to accept home opens EVERY weekend with zero compensation. This is like renting a car, but having to accept the hire company taking it off you whenever they like because they decided they may sell it. Why is that idea preposterous; but the rental market endorses this direct equivalent ????"
"The fact that landlords, dont rectify/ refer basic items. Emergency repairs are not refunded based on the fact we dont utilise their assigned repairers, however they dont respond when contact for an emergency repair."
Have the real estate actually fix things. 3 years to get blinds that work (living on a busy road) and over a month with broken tiles that are shattered and pushed up with young kids isn’t good enough. It would be nice to hang up some photos as well and make the house a home.
The bond approval process for leaving a rental.
"Safety. A minimum security standard should be enforced, to deter repeat attempted robberies."
Honesty and far better reception and attention by letting agents to the to repairs and maintenance to the rented property. Tenants are the customer in a rental agreement and should be treated correctly and not be ignored when issues seriously require attention.
4 weeks Deposit and 2 weeks advanced. Little too much. Would be more affordable if it's 2 weeks +2 weeks at least. 
"More freedom within the rental property
i.e. able to hang pictures, able to have pets
Rental authority and Real Estate Agents respecting that whilst living on the premises this is our home and allowing us to treat it as such. "
"Why do Real Estates have different rules when it comes to Tenants having to pay Water Rates is a no no. I do believe in Tenants paying for excessive water use. I have been renting for over 45 years now and have never ever up until one year ago had to pay a water bill......disgusting
"
"Regulations for Real Estates to have a more realistic income threshold across the board. For example, some Real Estates have set that a persons rent cannot exceed 33.3% of their households income.  For low income earners (min wage) they are constantly rejected based on their income and this is putting more pressure on social housing stock. 50-60% is more reasonable and maybe being enforced for all Real Estates to follow this guideline."
Longer term lease options similar to commercial leases. EG 2 or 3 year terms with option for further.
"I'd change the process including timeline between a tenant doesn't pay rent and when we can issue a Notice to Leave. The way the system is now, we have lost thousands in rent by those who know how to 'work the system'.
Ironically when someone steals something worth over $250 is a criminal offence whereas a tenant can deliberately not pay rent up to thousands of dollars and there is no penalty.
"
Less property inspections after a certain period of time 
"The length of time an owner has to fix problems with the house, even supposed insignificant problems.
Eg. the mailbox is damaged and about to fall over it has been this way for over 3 months. All the owner need to do is buy a new one (approx $15 from Bunnings) and install it. I think 2 weeks is an acceptable timeframe to fix it, but as it is not an emergency they don’t ‘have to’ fix it. Too bad about the tenant’s mail and the security of the said mail. "
The three month inspections are too many..... escpecially if you have an excellent record!
"I am 70 years of age and have been a smoker all my life.  Renters are discriminated against in this regard.  Home owners do not have any restrictions regarding smoking, so why should renters be restricted."
"Clearer ruling to damage and wear and tear
Clearer ruling to what is an owner responsibility and what is a tenant responsibility
Increase of rent by owner this can be better described in the act
Period for breaching and getting possession of a property due to rent arrears takes too long
 
"
There are inadequate provisions in place to safeguard the rights of owners.  Unfortuantley the downside to this is a lot of owners are contemplating getting out of property investments due to the changes in legislation and this in turn will have an impact on the availability of rental properties.
"As a former Property Manager & current landlord I have experienced all aspects of the rental experience.  It is not always the tenant that is the issue, some owners try to micro manage the tenants.  As with all aspects of life there are good and bad on all sides"
Fewer house inspections (if you have satisfied the Real Estate that you are up to a certain standard of cleanliness/maintenance) 
More rights for the owners of rental properties
Better communication with the Real Estate agents 
"Decrease prices Cairns Especially and Remove the Rule where owners can make you vacate ""Without Reason""."
"The performance of the rental agency in obtaining a number (preferably 3) of quotes for trade work needed to be done on rental properties.
Have more authority to evict tenants if they are late (on two separate occasions) on rent payments."
Allowance of pets in properties without need for approval of owners. 
"As a Community Housing not-for-profit Provider, housing those tenants in High need the RTA and QCAT need to look at making tenants more responsible for damage and condition a property is left. Law changes to force Centrepay Deductions to recover cost of damage which always exceeds Bond until the debt is repaid to either the Provider or Private Rental Market.  "
Allow dogs in more rental properties - ones that have good owners.
"The application process with the agent around pets being allowed was misleading in that the advertisement and agent stated that pets were allowed however, when it came to signing the lease there was a disclaimer saying pets allowed ""outside only"".  We sorted this out.  "
"Viewing times that aren't during business hours as most people work and it is difficult to get time off to look at properties. Also landlords/agents held more accountable for repairs not being done in property, no matter how small."
Being able to put up pictures and being able to have a pet. 
"The feeling that despite being a permanent, full time employee and generally responsible adult, the agents assume I'm going to wreck the place. 
That I can't have a pet.
That despite living in my unit for 3 years I am unable to sign a multi-year lease. "
Timeliness of repairs is an issue.  So is the amount of notice provided for entry.  Sometimes it is less than the required amount under law.
The cost. It's too high for what the average wage is
"The return of bond rights to the tenant. If a professional cleaner is hired when vacating the property, This is an immediate return of bond. There are still loop holes in the system for the land Lord to try and claim bond. I have never had bond withheld, but is it always a battle to get it back. Including going to court due to the real estate agent presenting the property filthy with rats and pests present."
More low costs housing 
Make all tenants pay for the insurance.....insurance to cover their damage their lack of rent payments etc.o Two months in advance to cover the time frame it takes to evict them thru the RTA and courts. If they can’t get insured they can’t rent.
The rules regarding pets
Making the property feel more like a home - hanging pictures and making other temporary adjustments to make the space feel more livable.
More communication from the real estates would be good.
Different approach to entry and exit condition reporting
The constant stress of getting your bond back even though you have looked after the house. It feels like that it is at the agents total discretion if you get the bond back. You should also be able to transfer the bond rather than having to find more money you get you old bond back.
Make renting more accessible!!!! I'm a student without a job (no one will hire me because I'm full time uni) so trying to get the money for a bond loan was so hard. 
More leniency regarding pets. 
"Greater availability at a reasonable cost, Make it more difficult for the rent to be increased yearly for no discernible reason."
"Stop Property Managers trying to get your bond money over little things when you leave a property. 
Stop the two weeks notice required to move from a property at the end of a lease.  Once a lease finishes, the tenant shouldn't have to provide another two weeks notice AND another two weeks rent, this is quite unfair.  
Stop the one weeks rent to be given with new rental applications, this one week rent money is never refunded if the application is unsuccessful."
People from the real estates are normally rude such as ignoring calls and emails.
Having trades allowed a key to enter the property when the renter is not at home for whatever reason. I feel we are not protected for privacy and contents.
stricter rules for tenants breaking leases higher bonds pet bonds
Being able to put things on the wall
More availability of contact with real estate.
Real estate co. Need to be reasonable when tenants are vacating properties. Everyone i kniw plus myself have had a battle to get their bond returned even though the property was in better condition than when they took over the lease. 
"less frequent inspections (I have had 6 in 12 months with 1 agent, most agents 4, still excessive & intrusive).

I have had an owner insist on 4 different quotes for a simple maintenance job. this involved me needing to be home 4 times (time off work) in 2 weeks.

Compensation paid by owners to tenants who break lease to move back into house."
"More freedom for the Tenants to live in the property as they will love in their own house. Like I cannot hang pics on the wall, cannot put my tv on the wall etc."
Being able to treat a rental property (with respect) as your own home e.g. hanging pictures etc
"When repairs need to be made to houses, that there is better support and stricter guidelines for them to happen. Asked about roof repairs causing leaks and mouldy carpet for over a year and the owners didn’t repair. Served the owners with a notice to remedy breach and they refused to repair and then ended my tenancy."
Easier access for repairs
"*The way renters are treated 
*Follow up from property managers 
* Tenants treated based on how they look after property "
The ability to force landlords/ real estate agents to take action on repairs
more affordable or less stringent rules on rent to wage ratio
For tenants to not be treated as an inconvenience or second class citizens 
More freedom to make the house your home.
Its to heavily weighted in the tenants favour
"More leniency on access to pets. You need to apply to firstly have a pet on the property and then the pet is only allowed to be outside. Our dogs are part of the family and it required a lot of sweet-talking and assurances to be allowed to have the dogs come inside at night. This is for the benefit of neighbours as it firstly prevents the dogs from harming nocturnal animals and secondly, prevents night time barking. "
A more positive attitude towards tenants. You are made to feel like a second class citizen.
Make it easier to rent with pets
"One thing only? More freedom for renters to make modifications to homes- adding shelves and storage options, painting walls, etc. If there were agreements in place that specified things like repainting walls to original colours, or removing and patching holes where shelves were, this could be amazing for long term renting."
I would like the ability to have a pet but at the same time I can understand the damage that can do.
The bond return process and the tenant really gets little say 
"'- Longer leases exceeding 12 months. 
- Policies on pet ownership in rentals and allowing owners of pets to have more voice in choosing properties to rent, instead of being limited to a small amount of places that allows pets. "
The inspection process is not flexible.
"Being notified whether application are successful or not quicker.
More rental properties would be helpful, in Cairns there is so much competition that it is really hard to find a house."
Less bond to pay to make it affordable for everyone.  Ideally added to each week's rent to help low income earning people.
"Feeling like I could treat the house as a home, e.g be allowed to put up pictures, or paint. I've rented in Sweden and as long as you left the place in a good state you could do anything in between."
More flexibility in the private rental market ie short leases and break leases
I believe at present that the system is tenant sympathetic.  I feel that it needs to move back to supporting the landlord.
Less than 2 months notice for changes to lease
Allow for larger Bonds to be charged as the current amount is inadequate 
More information regarding who is responsible for what.  In particular maintenance and upkeep of the property.
Maintanance should be done quicker 
Was very difficult to find a rental in an apartment block because we had a small dog.
each time rent goes up so does the bond i have to pay extra on the bond  which i do not think  is right
Fewer legislative requirements
"Allow Pets in all properties
Better entry and exit procedures"
Cheaper rent for better homes
Stop dodgy real estates lying about tennant requested approvals before rushing a lease signing
The ambiguous & non specific areas of the legislation
"Have agents be more flexible, reducing property inspections for renters who never have any issues, every 3 month feels like an invasion of privacy. Agents should not be allowed to enter the property if tenants are not home "
Better communication and response with realestate agencies. Required paperwork is kept and validated by realestate agencies (especially after tenant approval). Improvement of tenant rights (as apposed to what will earn the owner/ realestate agent the most money) 
"Consistency for both parties in the support provided by RTA. 
Give owners better support in the event of a tenant who causes neighbourhood issues. At this point the owners and agencies are limited in their options to move out objectional behaviour tenants. "
Better control/permission sought from tenants for routine inspections.  With legal right for shift workers to refuse a date where they would be sleeping due to shift work ( without extreme hassle or duress)
"As a renter it should not be a given that your bond is automatically retained by the real estate.
As a property owner it should be easier to evict a tenant when they are blatantly not paying their rent and generally being uncooperative.
Tenants should also have to comply when work is required on the property by the landlord. Works completed are for the benefit of everyone as they are being carried out to improve the property. It should not be seen as a way to try and get compensation by the tenant."
Automatic approval of pets. Children can do just as much damage to a property as pets. People should not be punished for choosing to have pets over children. Thankfully I've had very good landlords and there have been no issues having pets but I know a lot of others who haven't been so lucky.
"Making people accountable for maintenance repairs being completed. 
Ensuring that the property is at a letable standard that has been cleaned prior to being able to allow tenants to move in. "
"More security of tenure, cheaper rents. "
Allowing pets at any property
"The rules are too rigid, mainly regarding keeping pets or decorating walls."
The letting agent was extraordinarily rude and aggressive and obstructive. Made getting the keys extremely difficult despite us signing the lease and paying bond and rent in advance. They seemed not to be able to cope with tenants moving from Sydney to Brisbane who wanted to exchange documents electronically. They demanded we do further tasks such as watch a video about renting and sign other documents which were extremely draconian. A very unpleasant experience and felt like we were held to randson!! 
Longer leases as the standard (rather than the current annual renewal for most agreements) would provide more security and stability for both renters and owners.
Reduce the amount that rent can be increased per tenancy agreement
Having a agency that is local. Having one set price throughout the duration of our agreement.
Faster and easier ways to remove tenants from rental properties when issues arise and when the tenant is in breach of their agreement for items other than rent arrears.
"Ability to check the quality of my property managers to see if they are on a ""black list"" for treating tenants badly, bullying, not registering bonds, 'losing leases' etc. ' so I don't have the terrible experiences I've had due to dodgy property managers and real estate agents."
"More acceptance of renting with pets, especially in apartment living. We pay double the rent we have to for a property twice the size we need to keep a small dog."
"I feel that if you have rented a property for more than 2 years and each inspection is good with rarely any problems then we should have annual inspections. I find the 3 monthly inspections too invasive of a persons privacy especially if we live busy lives. However in some cases it may be required, ie tenants who abuse the property"
Compensation to tenants if the place they are renting is put up for sale. It’s a horrible experience to have strangers constantly coming into your home and poking about. Everyone except the tenants benefit in the sale of a rental property. The tenants just get to pay for the privilege.
Property managers that actually do their job
"More houses allowing pets.It's so hard to find.Children are messier than most pets and they're not banned.Also,being able to put up pictures,etc to make it feel more like your home."
"The cost of rent... The rent price is too high and seems to inflate but not parallel with the average wage increase. Rent is almost 50% of my weekly wage and this is the cheapest and most modest home we could find in a low crime area. It's a small unit with a tiny backyard with no-where for my child to play, we also no privacy as the house is semi detached. As a result we are constantly struggling to save for our own home, our hearts are in it, but bills come in and eat away at what we have accumulated. A dream of owning our home home is becoming shattered, unfortunately we don't want to live off noodles and no entertainment to fulfil that dream.

Also... walls... it's impossible to ensure no light damage comes to walls... it should be considered wear and tear. I'm extremely careful and even so I have put a couple of light scratches, now I have to pay to have the whole wall painted or lose my bond :/"
More ability/rights to have pets and more control over how many inspections are carried out per year.
Allowing of pets and landlords more accountable for requirements and ongoing maintenance.
"That rental property managers have to provide good customer service to renters rather than only considering the owners- I waited three months to have a dishwasher replaced which was not working when I moved in, the only reason Place changed the dishwasher was because I took it to the rental tribunal.   They are not accountable, did not return the form to the Tribunal. "
Better communication systems between Property Manager and Tennant as well as the ability to hang pictures without having to take pictures of every single tiny pin hole.
"Owners / property managers need to follow through on maintenance and repairs requests to keep the property in good condition. We pay high rent in a rural town with high unemployment and should expect our rental homes to be maintained by the owner, not out of our own pockets."
Allow animals on property
The landlord should have to get things fixed within a certain time frame
More freedom and cheaper so can save 
"When the house is old and not in great repair, not having qualified tradesmen fix the issues"
"I am a landlord now. However in the past I have been a tenant.
The RTA is not doing an effective job protecting people from destructive and criminal tenants and a register need sto be available.
this could also be good for poor landlords, and thereby protecting good tenants."
Better screening on potential tenants
I have had to take a tenant to QCAT to get monies owed. RTA dispute was a waste of time.
Educating tenants more on their obligations when renting a property. They are very aware of their rights but unfortunately they do not appear to be as are of their responsibilities.
"Rental Agents are appalling, they do not know the legislation and the legislation is confusing, misleading and geared totally towards the tenant.  Each time I've called the RTA I've been given different information, it appears to depend on who you speak to on the day that you call."
Longer notice periods for when a tenant wants to move out of expiring lease.
"Owners & managers require more authority to remove non compliant tenants
If a tenant is in breach consistently the rite to remove them should be provided instead of going back to zero after each breach."
Normalise extended leases up to say five years.
"Perfect tenancy record over 12 years then had a Property Manager use bullying and intimidation techniques to constantly inspect the house, not turn up when inspections where booked, I had no flexibility with inspections when I wasn't in the country so she wouldn't change them to give me time when I got home to ensure the property was up to scratch. I had a weekly cleaner however she would always find something eg lawn not mowed every week (fortnightly was not good enough) and would issues a notice of breach & come back a week later to ensure it was fixed. Tried to get claim damages when I left however I took it to court & I won with the judge telling her she was unscrupulous in her dealings. The stress of the 12 mths I was in this property was incredible. I was a property owner at the same time renting my property out & have never & would never treat one of my tenants in the same manner."
"Rental history to be used as a deposit offset / in lieu of a deposit for mortgages that aren't exploitive.

Saving for a 20% deposit while renting, especially in the city as a young person, is incredibly hard. The sooner we get people into houses the more likely they are to settle down and have kids. Allowing people to use rental payment history over 2-4 years as evidence of sustained income will get people into homes faster without an outlaid cost, with minimal risk on returns for lenders."
"More landlords accepting pets.
expanding the time between inspections if you are a good tenant.
Being able to put up family photos in your home."
Reduce routine inspections from quarterly to half yearly or yearly once property has been successfully inspected 4x in a year 
The processes and organisation involved with real estate agents. 
"1. Reduce the rent.
2. Eliminate fees associated with paying the rent.  Some agents insist on payment through a third party arrangement.  "
I believe the bond required should be increased as my experiences have shown tenants can manipulate the system to be in arrears and leave damaged property so that the total owed is much more than the bond.
Having to pay water bills
"Our current tenancy is going well. 
Differences between property management has been a huge issue in the past, particularly at the end of a tenancy. Bond returns are often held hostage by property managers, with fair wear and tear being such a subjective term. 

Tenants ability to keep pets is severely restricted in QLD, as is the ability to personalise a property by hanging pictures, etc. Requiring permission for picture hooks is really excessive. "
"The ability to hang my expensive artworks properly in my rental property as art is an investment and as long as the walls are kept clean and holes patched etc it really should not be an issue. Also, when requesting things to be fixed, the waiting times for owners to sort it out can be quite long and more damage tends to happen is damp in ceilings etc."
Long term lease
Tougher laws on strata smoking and smoke drift on balconies.
Allowing Pets in more rental places. able to make it more like a home.
Pets being allowed in all rental properties. 
I asked to have my pet. They declined.  In other states that is discrimination 
Pets allowed in more places. 
That single parents should not be turned away just cause they have defendants and realestate and landlords think they can not afford to pay the rent...they can
better property managements 
"Give renters the option of longer leases. It is treated as if it were law that you can only lease for a year. Given that it costs thousands of dollars to move a family, it is a huge imposition and treats renters as second-class citizens.
"
Better Rental Agencies - they are all hands down THE most painful thing about renting a property. 
The affordability of rentals in SEQ - the price is unreasonable for youth.
More oversight on owners to ensure property is maintained in a timely manner for the safety and security of tenants
The inspections feel extremely judgemental without flexibility if breach is found
Make it cheaper and not so hard to prove who you are 
Better property management by real estates eg. actually showing up at a inspection 
"The Fixed Term Tenancy. Every Agent we've rented through in Queensland always insists that at the end of the initial fixed term we sign on for a new term. This keeps you locked into an agreement, making it very hard when your looking to buy you own place.
We've been tenants in both NSW and VIC and this was never the case. Once the initial fixed term finished it just became a periodical agreement. You are still bound by the same terms, and are still required to give sufficient notice of your intention to vacate. However I feel that in QLD the Landlords and Agents have you over a barrel, because if you need to end your fixed term it's the tenant that is responsible for paying rent to the end of that term even though they need to vacate. 
"
Accountability of rental agent to fix problems.
"How Real Estates treat their Renters, stop the bullying tactics.  More transparency between the Renter, Real Estate & Owner."
"Ability to make it more of a home by putting up things, as long as they are fixed before leaving."
Keeping rents even and affordable 
"Having a representative who actually listens to your concerns and at least try to do something about it as well as keeping you involved in the process.
"
have more affordable options available for low incomers. 
The landlords arevrequired to make repairs they do not. We are expected to pay our rent weekly on time which we do. We take excellent care of the proporties we rent often making improvements arevour own cost. Then at the end of the tenanancy they hit us with damages that were there we we moved in.  Once it was a timber floor that had wera marks nearbthe door way. Normal wear and tear very old house. Even the realestates assistant noted it on the entry report. Own clams we dammaged it. Becausw the realestate was a relative of owner.. we gotnhit with damages.  It is just so unfair. Many property owners want to do their own repairs because they dont want to pay someone else to do repiars. This means we wait and wait for them to get completed. No discount for our inconvenience. 
It is hard to get approved for a home and houses are too expensive. Real estate agents tend to act like they're God and property investors act like parasites pushing for higher and higher returns without any consideration for the people who rent their houses.
I would like to be able to hang pictures or photos art work up on the walls.
Make renters much more responsible for their actions
real estates need to make a better effort to be at viewings and/ or fit in with people who can only view a property after hours or the weekend
Rental inspections should not be every 3 months. Invasion of privacy.
Real estate not treating  us like rudely becsuse we rent
Real Estate Property Managers should be paid more so they actually care about their jobs and will do it properly.
"Length of lease, often too short"
Real estates actually following the laws would immensely improve renting. 
Give tenants more flexibility to make the rental house more homely. 
Being able to improve the house. For more comfort and saftey
Agents nitpicking about dirty fans on inspection but not fixing ‘broken’ fittings 
"Minimizing the number of entries to my home by the onsite managers. I currently have 4 routine inspections per year l. In addition to this, I have a termite inspection, fire inspection, air conditioning inspection and the list goes in. Why can’t these activities be conducted as part of the routine inspections thus reducing entry to my home to 4 per year. "
if the owner of the house also has responsibilities to give maintenance to everything
Cheaper rent and longer times in between inspections.
being taken advantage of in my early 20s by real estate agents due to my age and naivete
"If a person/s have been good tenants for a good few years, the rent should stay the same, not be put up each year."
More flexibility with making minor changes like picture hooks and allowing visitors with pets for short stays.
I would like rent increases to be capped. Each year rent goes up. 
Realestate unrealistic expectations of the houses state of condition when moving out. 
Less overbearing control by landlords. 
"I feel that all rentals in Qld should have fixed air conditioning because of the extreme heat in summer.  Because this house faces west it can become unbearable in summer    the owner put window tint on the front windows, but it does not help.  I feel it should be the law to have air conditioning.  I also feel that more owners seem to allow pets now so it has got better over the year but i know i am a responsible pet owner, and i am sure there are people who are not."
Communication between all parties needs to be easier and more direct
Tenant's understanding of legislation and obligations. 
Less power for Real Estate agents who are unethical
The personal invasion on long term renters having to have inspections 3 monthly very inconvenient and they should not be allowed to take photos that include any personal property
Support when real estate agents do not respond to emails asking for urgent maintenance issues
I believe that as an owner of a rental property. Tenants need to pay more bond & held more responsible for major damages caused to property. Make it a Criminal offence. This may deter them.
More accessible ways for tenants to review and defend their rights under the RTA. 
"Allow breach notices against property managers to be sent directly to a government or authority directly, to ensure that managers who are not competent or who act illegally are addressed when these notices rack up. Right now these notices are sent to the manager or agent, who then is tasked with keeping them available for later review. I don't think this happens. "
"more flexibility for renters in regard to minor changes to the residence, and ability to keep pets."
Being able to hang pictures or put up a hook without asking
Being able to own a pet without permission from the owner
Making it easier for single income earners to rent. 
"Rentals are too expensive, 10+ years ago a single person could rent, now impossible to find affordable rentals when single, even alot of NRAS are high"
Greater rights for tenants
Dealing with the real estate when its time to move.
To be able to hang Photos Painting in a rental property that doesn't already have hanging hooks .
Being able to have my dog inside 
"Make agents and owners accountable for their actions. Regulate their practices such as inspection frequency, expectations at inspection and stop them from doing everything they can to take your bond from you."
Better communication between tenant and real estate.
"More communication methods/options direct to owner for certain serious issues.
Allow pets at most properties.
Ensure that the tenant is being treated with respect and not blamed for issues when it's not their fault."
"Allowing more time for tenants to complete entry condition reports, 7 Days to have completed is no long enough when first moving into a rental. Allow for at least 14 Days  so people can settle in and have the time to complete the report.

Also every quarterly monthly inspection should come down to 2 6 months inspection after 2 years of residing at a rental property. This will allow tenants feel like its there home. "
Better training for the RTA and additional training for property managers.
Pets accepted at more rental homes. 
Prevent the agents from constantly increasing the rent .
Houses not being maintained in a livable state
Ensuring all tenants are considerate of shared spaces.
"the \way rent is increased on tenants as it should stop going of interest not everyone can live paying ridiculus amounts of money we are here to save money an buy our own home,  not pay for someones 10th house or holidays "
Remove the threat of retaliatory no-fault evictions. 
Prices of houses for quality is sky high. Affordability is so bad at the moment. You do not get much quality for huge prices. Inspections are invasive and too regular particularly for long-term renters trying to save for their own houses meaning people will never achieve their goals.
"Dodgy real estate agents deliberately trying to withhold bond on leaving by making unrealistic demands re vacate cleaning, even when using their recommended cleaners.  Realtors demanding you sign another lease when you have expressed you are looking for another rental but no time allowances are given to time the move with vacate."
Communication from property management 
"Better/ higher standard of Minimum standards for health and safety, appropriate and liveable conditions for rental property's. Too many people are renting out properties they are not prepared to live in themselves, and will not repair or maintain to an acceptable level. Example: rotten stairs,    no fans/air con, smelly old carpet, mould, window screens, proper locks on doors etc.
Additionally, owners should NOT be allowed to order notice to vacate / increase of rent or retaliation after requesting repairs/maintenance. It's currently way to easy for owners to abuse this, and offer no explanation."
Longer leases. Uncertainty surrounding 6 month leases is incredibly stressful.
I am a home owner and do not rent a house although I am a Licenced Principal of a Real Estate Agency.  I have based my answered by not being biased and generally as to how my portfolio is operated.  
More availability of rentals for pet owners. Stricter laws and penalties on real estate agencies defrauding people of their bond money.
Not have the rent raised every time I sign a new lease
The current legislation I feel is sufficient to protect the owner and the tenant in its present format.
"Cheaper rent, especially for students."
Security screens on all doors and windows (preferably crimsafe) or being allowed to own a small pet
More freedom to make the place u rent a home 
"Honest, accurate, and timely communication from Landlord or Agent.  I am sick of being lied to, hearing pitiful excuses, or simply being ""fobbed off"" regarding the lack of maintenance."
Make it more fair for tenants with regards to maintenance etc. Also yearly inspections instead of 4 monthly. 
Lower rental prices and more option for pet owners. 
Making it easier to find wheelchair-accessible accommodation that will rent to wheelchair-users.
"'- Longer time between inspections, instead of every 3 months, it could be every 6 months for example
- Being able to be a pet owner and rent without being knocked back
- Being able to do what I like with the garden (eg. plant plants, remove plants that cause a lot of tree rubbish)
- Making the information about rentals for renters easy to understand, as some of the information can seem like it contradicts itself"
Have more ability to check prospective tenants if investment properties are self managed.
Property managers dong as they say they would
If things need fixing they are fixed within a 2weeks of being informed 
"The timing of finding a place to view, filling out the application and then having to move in. The process of getting a house was very frustrating. It seemed that we couldn't get an application in fast enough and it was a mad dash to have pre-filled applications ready to throw at people before we even finished looking at the property. And most places wanted someone to move in immediately so if you looked for a place too early you might end up paying two rents for a few months but if you were unlucky finding a place you could potentially be homeless. Having more leeway between applying for a rental and having to move in would relieve that stress, you wouldn't have to have perfect timing every time."
Harsher penalties for real estate agents when they operate outside the law or allow the landlord to operate outside the law - eg unathorised entry to property or altering lease agreements without telling the tenant
Energy efficiency in the property to minimize living costs to tenants
Having repairs rectified instead of being ignored
"As a landlord, the personal preference of a landlord to decide if house is pet friendly or not. 
As a renter, inspections every 4months, not 3months. "
Longer lease terms.
Fairer entry and exit inspections; particularly exit.
"Get rid of the feeling that real estate agents are doing everything they can to seemingly keep the owner happy at the tenant's expense. The fact that getting legal advice is a necessary action very commonly taken by tenants because of unfair disputes, and despite advice being in tenant's favour, it remains nearly impossible to reason with the real estate for a result without a lot of grief. If real estate agents weren't constantly trying to get around doing the right thing for the tenant, that would vastly improve the experience. Knowing that you don't have an 'even playing field' with the owner and always being considered the guilty party, no matter what, isn't comfortable. So many lies, omitted information, and half truths told by agents and owners!
I think also the fact very few places allow pets is really quite ridiculous. "
More security from rental agreements and better accountability for owners to make basic repairs to keep the property liveable. 
Realistic rental price
"Not being treated a like trash
"
"Make the application process far less humiliating by educating the vacuous 20-somethings lacking in basic manners and respectful communication who call themselves ""Property Managers"" - as if it put them above the rest of society."
Allowing to have pets in all rentals.
"Allowances for pets and picture hooks on walls.
Pets are now part of the family and noone says you cant have children in a rental property. Ive seen children do more damage than my cats have.

As long as all damage is fixed apon leaving, this shouldnt be a problem."
Quicker actioning of maintenance & easier avenues to both sides to hold each other to account for maintenance issues. 
Realestate agencies that are more professional/more responsive.
More lenience for pets with options like pet bonds that enable tenants to take responsibility and own a pet in a way that is fair to both the tenant and the owner
A bit more leeway around decorating your house and pet restrictions.
"More information and time before inspections. 
More accurate property descriptions and entry reports. 
More transparent information from agents about the condition of houses and house history "
Not so many inspections after you have lived in a property for more than 5 years and you are a good tenant 
"No permission from landlords for animals in properties
Picture hooks to be installed
Larger bonds to cover pets
Break Lease should include tenants paying rent until new tenant found
Carpets need to be professionally cleaned at vacate
Tenants to use professionall cleaners for all vacates
Pest treatment to be done at vacate"
I would like to see if you are a long term Tenets and I have taken out a 2 year lease that the Inspections every 6 months and not 3 months Especially if you are a good tenant
"More protection for landlords, bonds rarely cover damage bills and there is no practical comeback."
"Pets can be allowed as long as tenants are responsible to ensure their pet has annual vaccines, worm treated, etc.  My dog is a fax terrier and he barks to announce that someone is at the door or will bark to protect the territory and his family 

Neighbors should also learn to respect others. In our case our neighbors own their units, but my family and I are the only ones renting. If contractor comes over and does work on our territory,  they should at least have the decency to inform us 22-24 hrs before as I have several medical conditions that want me to rest. I cannot do that in the comforts of our home if that happens. 

As tenants we should also be given right if way in the front parking so in case if emergency we can maneuver our car or worse,  an ambulance comes. 

They placed barriers just because the unit they bought didn't have access to a garage. Friends who come over to visit say it is illegal. "
More rights around privacy in the property
"Being more aware of things like disruptive tenants in apartment blocks, noise control in buildings etc"
Having locks changed when moving into a new rental.
Allow pictures/hooks to be hung on walls (properly)
"More pet friendly properties. 
As a pet owner, I understand that pets do tend to have higher wear and tear on a property, however, pets are found in majority of homes in Queensland. I have found through my rental history that I have to compromise on a quality house (Ie. nicer house within my price range) as properties that are suitable for pets (have large yards etc) do not allow pets. As a pet owner, I should not have to choose between my pets and having a nice home within my price range. I have had to go for a cheaper house that may not be as suitable in some instances just to accommodate having my pets. "
"Have better rules around pet ownership in body corporates.  Dangerous dogs to be banned, online registration of pets for body corporates where owners input that dogs are micro-chipped and all vaccinations are up to date. This would be achieved through data matching via a veterinarians web site or a government sponsored register. "
Being able to have pets no questions asked.
have an authority with actual powers to support tenants
Increasing rental bond. 
Nil. Have very good Landlord 
Get rid of paper forms and have everything online. 
More options to terminate lease
Availability and better prices 
Creating a blacklist of landlords who treat tenants badly.
"Improve the process surrounding breach notices.  By the time the landlord has given breach notices for unpaid rent, the entire bond is almost gone and then we are left with no money to pay owed rent and cleanup."
Ensuring rent is affordable for all - when I was renting before purchasing a property it was very difficult to get maintenance done on public housing property; 
Better rights for Landlords and better tax deductions for Landlords
Being able to treat it as my home not.my rental 
Make it easier to own pets.  If the pet does damage take it out of bond.  If it will cost more get the landlord to get a legit quote. Fair is fair. 
More affordable one bedroom rentals so I could live without a flatmate
Affordable rent. Less intrusive real estate
Pay more attention to the condition report at the start.  Not having rented for about 30 years I thought it would be a fair assessment based on age of property - I was wrong !!!
Better rights to remove bad tennants
"I would love to have more freedom to have another pet, and hang pictures in my home to make it more my home. 
I also have constant inspections which feel very invasive, every 2-3 months is too many. "
More emphasis on tenant responsiblities
That their is no discrimination for owning a pet
More flexibility with Interior of premise. E.g. Placing pictures on walls and installing curtains. 
To allow small pets when renting houses with gardens/yards
"More transparency of property management companies. Our current property management company refuses to reply to emails or answer phone calls about issues with the property or general questions that we have. Very unprofessional, but there's nothing we can do about it."
Lack of value shown by agents to renters.  Been renting for 8 years and have been made feel as if the agents are doing you the favour by allowing you to rent.  They are always keen to catch a person out who is renting.  Had to Use RTA assistance a few times and have won my case as the agents had no evidence to support accusations.
RTA have a list of tenants that have have been breached that private landlords/agents can access.
"I would support any Queensland government initiative in provision of affordable housing options ie rental accommodation, fair rent courts, home loans for people on low incomes, independent housing tribunals, provision for pets, definitions of fair wear and tare.


"
"Water and sewerage charges should be paid by the tenant , the way tenants pay there electricity and internet ."
Cap the cost of rent that can be charged. Rent seems to be able to jump higher whenever there seems to be a change in the economy. 
Easier to remove tenants who damage or do not pay.
Interest paid on your bond money
"Stricter on rental managers, owners need to fix places up that are not in suitable living conditions, especially if they previously got bond from last tenant. "
"The need to ‘undo’ changes I’ve made to the property with owner approval before I have moved out. For instance, I gained approval to have picture hooks professionally installed (which I paid for), but then had to pay to have the removed, filled in and painted at my expense when I left the property at the end of the lease. The same with a herb garden at another property. Both approved by the owner, both adding value to the property, both safe and professional with all expenses covered by me. But, having to be removed, because that is the letter of the tenancy agreement,"
Having set time frames on owners to fix any issues that may arise with the property. 
The bond of 4 weeks is very prohibitive when you are moving from one property to another. You have to have another 4 weeks bond for the new property as well in advance so it is very difficult to have that much money outstanding. There needs to be a transferable system in place between agencies.
"Having more say in when I am ready to leave the property.
Last two experiences - landlords would not accept month by month agreement even though I did not want to stay long term. Does not give opportunity to find suitable alternative property, as required to be out at a date to suit landlord."
"Having pets. We have a very small dog...less than 2kgs. And cant get  another...as we arent allowed.
Cant hang a picture."
"Right now the number of options for pet owners is very limited, in addition to this it has become standard across the QLD rental market to add clauses to agreements which hold the tenant liable for costs associated with pre-existing wear or dirtyness"
"Tenants having more rights when the landlord won't repair or delays repairing.  and by more rights, i mean more than speaking to a disinterested person at the RTA!!!"
"Only rented once for 6 months, found communication with agent was poor and had to contact them numerous times to get one response back. "
"Agency advertising should be ""real time"", giving all personal info only to find out the place is rented is common place. Not fair regarding my personal info nor should it be happening."
Being allowed to make it a home. 
Reduce the ability for property managers to gouge Bond.
Real estates attitude towards renters 
Ensure rental increase doesn't happen every time you renew a lease and be able to put pictures in the walls 
"Paying less rent, have few inspections"
"Lowering prices, increasing availability of rental properties, more pet friendly rentals"
Higher number of places that accept pets
Extremely high water charges
Having much more warning if the property is going to become unavailable for continued tenancy.
Rental agencies are difficult to deal with
Allowed to male it a home eg hang pictures 
Able to have pets.  Easier ways to have bond refunded.  Ability to make rental property more home like ie hanging pictures etc.
Tenant ratings/reviews 
Privacy for the tenant via reduced inspections
The Landlord and Tenant have equal rights
"A more average price range within one area, example - where I live there's newer 4 bedrooms homes to rent that range from $350 - $480 but you get nothing more or nothing less... Doesn't make sense. "
"Better protections of property and leaseholder rights for vulnerable renters: disabled, aged, low income solo women. 

Protections from both aggressive neighbours imposing on our homes and negligent landlords not upholding their end of lease terms. 

Would require coordination at state,  city council and independent body level, possibly law reform to cover situations with aggressive, serious ongoing nusiance and neglect issues that are occurring more in Qld now that more people are low income renters in higher density units. "
Allowing pets inside
"Home owners who can’t afford maintenance and general upkeep of a property ensuring the safety and enjoyment of the tenant shouldn’t be able to have these types of investment properties. If Outstanding maintenance requests are pending, rent should not be increased at the end of the lease agreement to cover these costs."
Making it easier to find a rental property for families
Improved tenant security to stay on in the home. Longer agreements.
More time between  inspections after a couple of years of good inspections. 3 monthly inspections are a real pain and an invasion of privacy when you are a good tenant. 
"Make the RTA legislation reflect the QCAT decisions that are made.
For example when the tenants moved in there was no dent in the garage door, QCAT decision - tenants aren't responsible as anybody could have damaged the door. A clear case of the RTA Legislation being that ""property must be in similar condition at exit as it was at entry - less wear and tear. No damage to door when the moved in, large dent in door when they moved out - property not left in similar condition."
"The cruel and inhumane rules that state I must force an old and frail pet to be outside 24 hours a day  - with the idea that I can not rent if I have a pet that needs to be inside at least some of the time.  Of course I can't do that to my pet because it would be illegal not to provide adequate shelter and care relevant to a cat's needs as demanded by law in the ""Queensland Animal Care and Protection Act (2001)"" This shows the the renting regulations on leases that state pets cannot be allowed anywhere under the roof inside the dwelling are not legally compliant. 

Lease requirements are also not compliant with the requirements to prevent cats from killing wildlife because if they are outside all night like the lease demands, they will kill wildlife or spread FIV. Landlords do not provide a 'catio'. Catio's can be dangerous because being locked in an enclosure outside can prevent a cat from moving away if it gets hot inside the catio, and this can kill the cat. 

Pet companionship is a part of life, and property owners should be legally compelled to recognise and accommodate this. Animals need to be allowed at least confined access inside the home at night, and in adverse weather conditions. Patios are not always adequate for an animal to be on all the time, especially in regional and rural areas where if you force an animal to be outside at night with the idea it can have 'shelter' on a patio or outside deck at night it will be killed by a snake.

I have also experienced real estate agent and property owners renting out dilapidated properties, and charging significant rent for them. One property I rented had a metal shower tray in the bottom of the shower with exposed wall inside the shower cubicle above the tray.  The tray was not tiled over and cocroaches and ants would come through the wall and crawl in the shower tray leaving roach crap in the shower and mushrooms would grow out of the holes inside the shower cubicle. It was a 2 bedroom dilapidated place with both rooms off a tiny lounge and they charged $215.00 per wk, now $225.00 per wk out in the rural area close to nothing. I don't think anyone should be allowed to rent that at all, or charge exorbitant rent for having a shower properly tiled either. 

In this same dilapidate house, there were no screens and it was a furnace in summer, but with no screens if I opened the windows at night which was only hot air anyway, I got bats flying in because of no screens and they were flying round and round above my head up on the ceiling. I could have been bitten and got that bat virus, plus no security with open windows and no screens.

I am disgusted at the kind of properties people are allowed to rent, and the price they are allowed to rent them for - and the real estate agents says to the landlord - ""We can get you even more money for that"" and they put the rent up to justify the landlord paying them management fees. It's disgraceful. This forces low income people to be forced to live in squalid conditions.
"
I would prefer to have notices posted as we have not received any emails and have had the real estate enter without notice.
Reduce the notification period for landlords
Support for tenants with pets. More open house times. Rental agents have been extraordinarily rude.
"There needs to be more pet friendly houses on the market, we struggled to find a house with our dog and he’s just as much of a part of the family as a child and we got told by multiple agents just get rid of him"
I would change the process of eviction.  It is too easy for tenants to cause major heartache for the landlord and then leave with the landlord required to pick up the tab.
"'-Allow pets more often, preferably adopt the laws implemented in VIC
-Access to more affordable renting options that aren't health risks
-Real estate regulators - enforce recent pictures, pictures required of indoors unless occupied, allow people to rent ""site unseen"", more availability, better rent control during tenancy"
more financial consideration for landlords as we have been left out of pocket three times in the last few years by tenants who do not do the right thing. The properties were all rented thru real estate agents who have followed the rules (and even gone to court in some cases) however we seem to be the ones financially burdened at the end of the day.
Notice periods from either parties are unbalanced. Two months from owner to tenant but only two weeks from tenant to owner seems very unfair especially when the market is low.
Being able to get a result regarding tenants cleanliness during the tenancy. Requiring tenants to fix nicks and fonts and damage during tenancy.
Two months vs two weeks notice to leave
Real estates need to be more understanding
"fast tracking when lesseess are in arrears
"
Fairer laws for landlords who have undesireable tenants that know how to work the system to their advantage
"there needs to be longer term renting options RE 
Europe 5- 10yr plus 
to give( good tennents  security )"
make the owner do repairs...
Not being judged so badly and people actually reading your history instead of judging
Increased training of property managers. 
I would like to see fair rights for Landlords as well tenants.
make notice to leave/notice intention to leave 30 days from either side (not 60 day/14 days respectively as it now is)
Nothing I have great landlords
Easy to rent with dogs
Possibility to access bad tenants database without charge
Property managers' attention to ensuring tenants  comply with their obligations to maintain the property
Improve the quality of rentals for the price
Make sure owners carry out repairs and don't put up rent unnecessarily 
"More strict measures  put on  owners of properties to have places well maintained. Properties that are more priced on condition rather than location and perhaps a body that can determine how much a place should really be worth and not just market value. For example, if a property is in a good area, market value may have it at $400 a week but the condition of the property is below par and should be no more than $300 a week. If owners want their market value rates, they'll make sure their properties are worth it."
"Making the overall experience easier
Too many steps, documents to sign and restrictions"
Strictness of rules e.g. can't put my washing out on the balcony 
To give a notice of inspection by mail hasn't worked well. It would be great if an SMS was used instead. 
"Rent price ranges should be allowed. 
Pets should be allowed in properties (i.e small pets up to 6kg) anything over that would require further approval 
"
"Longer leases, and property owners should cover a percentage of moving costs (or bond equivalent) if they sell within the first 12 months of renting. "
More balance between the needs of the tenants and those of the landlord
"Once a lease has been signed, tenants should be allowed to have an uninterrupted tenancy. If an owner wants to sell, he should have to wait until the tenancy expires. No one should be allowed to interrupt this tenancy for the purposes of Reletting or selling a property. Access in these instances should only be allowed once the current tenant has moved out, and access for these two purposes should not be allowed until the tenant has vacated. Currently, tenants do not get compensated for this intrusion on their tenancy and have no say in its occurrence other than 24hours notice. This is pure harassment for any tenant."
More accurate advise given by the RTA or better access to information.
"Be allowed to have pets. 

Less rent increases

Property manages to approve maintenance if they haven't heard from the landlord with 4 weeks. "
Options for a longer lease when owner/manager and renter are happy.
"Mutual respect has declined. We've rent for 35 yrs across S.E. Qld, Sydney and Melbourne. Over last 15 years in Qld owners and agents have generally become less interested in us as people who agree to pay rent and more interested in flipping properties, getting rent increases based upon an always rising property valuation and equally avoiding spending on necessary property maintenance.
A lot of owners today are cash strapped and asset rich and create a feeling of resentment directly or via their agencies towards not wanting to have long term relationship with their tenants who care enough about their properties. Keeping tenants dangling with short term tenure is the focus. That is not healthy for the tenant.
When I rented a commercial business my lease was a 3 year with 2 x 3 year options...We rent that premise for 10 years. That gives both tenant and owner financial security and tenure. Private leases are becoming more like commercial now that private tenants have to pay for so much of the outgoings. Beats me why an owner wouldn't want a good tenant to stay long term..."
"The environment & facilities. Also, the right to do with the house."
Get a more streamlined system than QCAT
Better quality housing for affordable prices
as a long term renter with no issues i would like less frequent inspections (currently done every 3 months)
More affordable renting and more pet friendly and more rentals
the ability to have a pet in my unit complex
"Pet ownership, specifically the 4 legged kind.  Also to be able to hang pictures or make minor alterations that enhance the property. "
Better communication from property managers 
"More attentive landlords. 
More pet friendly properties. "
Have more access to NRAS housing around Queensland rural areas not only SE Queensland.
The duration QCAT allocates to tenants who are damaging the property and not paying their rent.  21 days is far too long to allow tenants to remain in the property creating damage.  This time frame needs to be reduced to 10 days
More reliable letting agents. 
"Tenants getting a fair go. Real Estates to do the right thing and fixing things, instead of blaming the owners. "
Notice periods for tenants and owners are two different. Tenants need only to give 14 days to vacate and an owner needs to give 2 months notice. I think it should me more in line with other states so the notice periods are closer together. 
How expensive it is to rent in QLD
More accountability for owners to try find new tenants when leaving a lease early
The amount of changes to the renting tenancy agreement and the conditions.  I feel sorry for some owners who try and do the right thing by the tenants and nearly always ends up paying.
Bullying tactics of Real Estate agents
"More balance between renters and landlords/agents. Favours renters (RTA, QCAT)"
Both tenants and agents would like the Gold Coast City Council to take water  meter  readings and for this to be billed to the tenants direct.  Currently this is left to the managing agent to on bill the tenants which causes confusion at both the beginning and end of the tenancy as tenants ask for the Council Water Meter Read.
Reasonable rental prices - it's difficult to find QUALITY housing and it's extremely poor value for money in Queensland compared to other states.
Allow us to own pets. We could pay a pet bond for those properties that won't allow them to cover any damage. 
There are so many things... tenants to pay a larger bond is a good start 
Landlords to give the same amount of notice to end a tenancy
I would like tenants to stop telling me lies!
Ensure rules around renting are fairer and not biased towards tenants.
Making renters liable for inability to maintain a clean house leading to damages in a home. And harsher punishments for non rental payers
Pet bond to encourage more owners to allow pets in rental properties
notice to leave time frames - even it out for both tenants and owners
Make it compulsory for landlords to accept pets of a reasonable size or type.
I dont rent I manage 2 large rental offices
"Make it easier for large families to rent,  especially when history isn't perfect "
"Equality between the act for tenants and landlords/property managers. E.g. 2 months for landlords/property managers to provide notice, 2 weeks for tenants. 1 month for both parties is more than adequate.  Speed up the process of breaches and notice to leave.  If a tenant gets in arrears it can take weeks before a tenant can be terminated.  By this time the bond can be used up on rent alone.  Increase the bond amount to equal 6 weeks rent.  Bond too often does not cover all issues in bad situations. "
It should be a criminal offence for a tenant who damages a house
Real-estate agents being so critical of units they inspect.
Would like the opportunity to be allowed to have pets. Pets are part of the family too and help make a house a home. 
ability to have pets. We have a young family that would love to have pets but cannot find a house owner willing to let us have a pet at the house.
"To be treated respectfully by agents, as opposed to being regarded as potential threats to their clients asset."
"Making the agent more responsible for there job as many do not know what they have to look after on behalf of the owner.
Also many do not look at the external part of the building"
Better property managers. There is no consistency and the vast majority of companies have been very incompetent. 
Get rid of the rule around a rent payment being made on a particular day being considered to be made on that day regardless of the time of day the payment was made. We all know banks close off at a particular time e.g. 4pm so payments made after that time electronically should be considered to be next business day as the funds are not available to the property manager/landlord. It doesn't work in with property management software either which doesn't acknowledge funds until they arrive in the trust account.  
Reduce expenses for property owners
"When exiting lease real estates & property managers always seems to find costs to add before leaving. They are never satisfy of how clean you leave property regardless of entry report being filthy. The cost they add can go up to thousands of dollars leaving tenants out of pocket, no bond refund & put on TICA. Most of the time real estates will turn what should only cost the tenant a few dollars into charges that are ridiculous. They dont give the tenant an option to rectify the problems first & majority of the time they do repairs inside the homes that are not damaged or needing repairs. They will turn a run down home into a star hotel at the expense of the tenant & 90% of the time repairs that need fixing in the home while renting are never repaired so the tenant is stung with the bill at the end of the lease. "
Agents response time in resolving issues.
"Be able to paint, hang pictures and be able to modify the rental to how we want it. We are paying so why not give us a bit of freedom."
That QCAT operate within the laws of the ACT only not who the adjudicator feels more in tune with on the day.
Ability to have pets in rent al accomodation.
Long term rental security
"Tenants should be liable for the full water and waste water (sewerage) charges to the property, not just their water consumption charge.Also the Garbage,Environmental.,Community Services and State Govm't State Emergency Levy. with a commensurate drop in rental charge."
Owners should have to maintain their properties to a certain standard at all times
making my rights as a tenet more clear. Also making options for tenets to catch up on rent incase you struggle.
Better communication between all parties. 
I do not rent myself I am interested in these changes as an owner
Real estates doing their job
More balance in the laws for landlords
"Pets allowed.
More security in time periods but also some flexibility.
Less scope for increasing rent, especially when the property isn’t maintained. 
Better communication with agents including a bit more flexibility with inspections — they expect me to drop everything so they can inspect and then never action repair or maintenance requests. "
Making the RTA more digitised and online.
make sure both parties are treated fairly
Greater rights for renters in terms of pet ownership and minor alterations to properties such as hanging pictures.
"The landlords and real estates have far too much power. They can not renew your lease without warning, the laws surrounding pets are ridiculous and the price gouging on rentals where demand is high is despicable. 

I've been openly told to auction my rental price on my application. ie the property will go to the highest bidder. 

Then you finally do get a place, and you can't report anything for fear the owner will evict you or raise your rent. When the demand outstrips supply, the whole place goes lord of the flies. "
Pets allowed in every rental 
More balance between renters wants and landlord wants
Make the legislation simpler
"Less bias against pet owners when renting. Many properties will not allow pets. Unless it is legislated that there cannot be pets in specific properties, there should be not be properties where animals are not allowed. "
Making Tenants take responsibility for their actions.
lower rental prices in inner city suburbs or a review on the cap for NRAS applications. 
Inspections should be done at a time more convenient to the tenant. I do not like the idea of someone coming into my house when I'm not there.
Better communication between Property Managers and Tenants
Better laws and protection for landlords 
Fairness to ALL parties by the RTA and QCAT instead of a strong leaning towards tenants that has been very obvious
"Make it mandatory to allow pets on premises, up to a certain size and breed. "
"More freedom and flexability in terms of use of property. Hanging paintings, pets etc"
Reduce the weekly rate.
Pet friendly rentals.
Limit rent increases
"Ensure that the property is left in the same condition as on entry, fair wear and tear excepted.  The property should not be handed back, ""Reasonably Clean"" thus requiring the landlord either pays or spends time cleaning the property  to  then let clean as required."
More pet friendly properties 
"The balance needs to be restored between owners and tenants from where it is currently in the tenants favour e.g. periods of notice required by the tenant compared with the owner, inadequate redress provisions where tenants mistreat properties, tenants routinely lie about number of people living in a property, reasons for withholding payments e.g. rent, water etc, presence of pets etc. with no effective redress to the owner."
Not so strick on pets. It is impossible to find houses that allow pets.
"make the laws more balanced and fair . At the moment they favour tenants in most things but are so vague in areas such as cleaning fair wear and tear. Yard cleaning and maintenance. And why do we need to make a decision about staying 2 months out one month both ways would be more fair.
"
The one main thing that I would change would be effort made by the real estate and owner to make maintenance and repair requests approved and actioned (poor effort made by our property management team)
a govt owned 2 bedroomed home
Would love to own a small dog
"financial hardship when you have a bond, when you move you need to put up a second bond & live in between for the time it takes first bond to be refunded. I think 2 weeks bond is fairer, we are renting as we can’t get a deposit together for a house deposit in the first place. if you have a proven good record over xx number of years I think you should only have to pay two weeks. "
Being able to sign more long term leases
Owners/agents having to give tenants 2months notice is a very long period of time.
for listings on tenancy databases to have a time limit.
"Pets being allowed in rental properties, more privacy, more car spaces and more compassion and kindness from realtors. "
To stop the greed by owners and real estate agency’s that force up rents
"Ensure consistency in answers provided by the RTA; as they often provide incredibly inconsistent answers and at times even recommend actions which contravene the act. I believe there needs to be better training of RTA officers so that tenants and landlords have access to consistent, accurate & fair information that is in line with the act & doesn't unduly favour either party."
Easier access to rights 
Ability to ask for more bond than 4 weeks. 
"Allowing of pets to inhabit rental properties more freely.

"
The selection of tenants in large complexes. 
"Realtor attitudes.  Any changes to leases should be discussed with tenants, agreements are hard to read."
"More consistency between rental contracts. A consistent standard of practices amongst all rental  companies. If I could, I would like more autonomy to chose what rental companies I work with (based on prior experience). However, this is limited by where I want to live and the housing available. "
"Allowing pets
Ensuring properties are well maintained and priced appropriately "
"the right to decide whether or not the tenant can have pets, assistant pet excluded."
"I think to be fair the notice to leave should be the same for the Landlord and the tenant.  At present the Landlord has to give 2 months but the tenant only has to give 2 weeks.  This is very unfair and makes it hard for the Landlord to mitigate loss.
"
"I have a good landlord and agent, however, lots of people arent so ""lucky"". I would bring in harsher penalties for landlords not fixing things in reasonable time as well as an actual list of whats considered a reasonable time for different classes of items (i know someone who didnt have an oven for 3 months)."
More responsive property management 
"You should be able to pay off a bond instead of having to provide it up front in full, esp when you're moving from another place and you have to wait to see if the bond will be returned to you and even if it is, it doesn't come until after you've paid the same or more to the new realtor. Who has that sort of money these days? That's why we rent instead of buy, because we can't save the deposit to purchase our own place and pay a mortgage to the bank that's cheaper than the rent to its owner"
Magistrates need to understand that tenants sign a lease and QCAT should not be about the law 
"Better communication with real estate, home owner and tenant "
Option to fill in hard copy applications instead of online applications
Land lords that won't do anything to the house your renting. You look after their place pay your rent on time but ignored when you put a request any work done.
Easier to get a house that allows my dog 
Being able to apply for properties with pets 
Requirements of landlords to fix things within a certain time.
Tougher gardening regulations.
The notice period landlord's and agents to a tenant they no longer wish to tenant their property is too long and disproportionate to the time having to be given by the tenant. 
Consistency of rules / service across rental agencies 
"Making bond easier. What is stopping the bond from being moved easier between 2 different properties with the difference being paid.
Surely there can be something done about this, because it can be hard to get on top of the moving costs."
Allow pets as a given.  Allow changes to the property as long as it is returned to the original condition (if not found to be beneficial to the landlord).
Fairer property managers
"Customer service, poor communication from the real estate property agent  has resulted in misinterpretation of messages resulting in incorrect actions taken which has in-turn cost me the tenant unnecessary expense and a lot of wasted time. In addition lack of consideration for the comfort of the tenant with no compromise on any matter."
Maintenance of property by landlords
"Being in a hot climate, having solar to help with electrical bills. "
Longer lease periods.
"Limit realestate inspection comments to items that impact the residence. I take pride in my accomodation, I do not need a ""well done"" or a score card to evaluate my cleaning."
More accountability for property managers and owners.
Tenants need to be more respected
Faster action re maintenance and repairs
Allow pets in all rentals
Renters allowed to have pets and put paintings on walls
"A register for Tennant's who don't pay rent , damage homes and are serial offenders"
More help for those that need it in regards to maintaining suitable living standards
"Third party agents, eg maintenance workers should not be given keys and in supervised access to your rental. "
The ability to shift a bond from one property to the next
End of no reason evictions
Most Queensland houses for rent are in terrible dis repair. Landlords should have to care for their houses just like tenants do. I think tenants should be able to review rentals like Airbnb.
More personal independence and more rights to come back at property mangers
The owner just trying to do everything on the cheap and the tenant having no say
"Long term rental accommodation or subsidised seniors rental villages.  Yhere are too many retirement villages where the option is to buy in at considerable cost, eg $250,000 upwards.  I am lucky to have recently moved to a retirement village in Mackay securing one of four rental units.  The remainder are buy in, the Company Bolton Clarke may release  more rental units in the future.   I hope my rental is long term. "
"Fairer prices for houses. The poor size of the homes compared to what we pay for them, is an absolute joke. Also, no leasing inspections while we still occupy the house. There's nothing worse than the thought of some stranger walking through your bedroom while you're not there. Massive invasion of privacy."
"We look after the place and they sell.
We need long term housing."
Inspections every 6 months instead of every 3 months for long term tenants. For example a tenant of 3 years or more should only need an inspection twice a year.
Rent takes too much of my income. I am on a single income and low wages but feel lucky to have a job at my age.
"Realistate agents very bad at keeping records and confirming things.  Regularly get sent wrong things, even when left the property months ago."
"Lessen the notice period to give tenants to leave in certain situations - particularly those that continually play the system and are continually late with their rent, and lessen times it takes to get bad tenants out.  QCAT is too onerous to go through most of the time, and takes too long to get a result.  2 months is too long, a tenant can do a lot of damage in that period."
"Make it easier for rent negotiation in a renter's market. New renters get a lease reflecting the low rent market. Those renewing a lease are not offered lower rental rate, reflecting the current market conditions."
"Living flexibility, such as hanging photos, pets, and rules regarding longer staying guests. "
More freedom to make the house a home and more security from owners selling houses and then having to move all the time 
Lack of a bad tenant database
Pet friendly for all houses.
"the vacating process, i have moved to QLD from NSW, you have the opportunity to complete a house clean and are not required to complete a compulsory hire of a bond cleaner. example i have always vacated a rental the way it given on entry as per inspection report and my bond has always been given back by the agents ie. LJ Hooker, National, Starr and Partner.  Spending $450-$650 for a clean that is done as good as i have done is simply over rated."
Long term rental opportunities and protection from unreasoonable rent rises.
"On entry, all entry and exit doors would be in working order and easily accessed with the keys provided."
Privacy - less routine inspections for good tenants 
"More obligation on tenants for repairs to property that are questionable in origin.
It seems the tenant can simply say something is broken and the owner is responsible for the repairs."
Make it easier to get rid of problem tenants
Agents need to make sure properties are clean before leasing
Less restrictions on pets
Be able to choose who you rent to. 
Automatic annual rent increases. Landlord repair and maintenence 
more strict guidelines that realestates/landlords must abide by. eg. inspections not breaching a tenant for having dishes on sink or dust on shelf etc
"Far more restrictions on when owner / agent / maintenance can enter. Ideally only with tenant consent. Far fewer inspections, and entry requests instead of notices for non emergencies. e.g. ""dear Tenants, which day this week suits you for a fire safety inspection?"" instead of the current ""fire safety inspection is tomorrow, if you're not home, we'll let ourselves in."" It's not my home if strangers can let themselves in."
Strengthen aspects of the Tenancy Agreement.
To be free to have a pet without having to ask the landlord.
Flexibility as far as hanging pictures and having pets. 
"'- Able to put pictures up on the wall 
- Owner unable to sell within a year of of starting of lease 
- Able to keep pets at all rentals as long as it has a yard and fence "
I wouldn't change anything really it seems reasonable overall 
I feel like I could be kicked out at any minute due to strict management that are always around. 
level up the playing field for landlords and tenants eg termination notice disparity
Faster response and action to concerns and repIrs 
Ensure bad renters are identified for future property owners. Ensure property owners offer safe and clean housing. 
"I have been renting for 16 years now in the same house with the same agent.  I have never had any complaints about the way the house is maintained.  I actually do more maintenance to the house than the landlord.  But I still must have a 3 monthly inspection.  I would have thought have this time a 12monthly inspections would be more than enough.
I also do not like the way anyone can just walk in and do what they like.  Do you realize this voids my content insurance as the insurance company looks at this as if I gave them access to the house."
Not be charged full rent when one bedroom of our house was flooded due to the owner 
"Effective communication between landlords, property groups and on site managers to ensure comfortable living conditions for tenants."
Having to put up with people invading your privacy
"Real estate agents representing both the owner and tenant fairly. Most agents do not abide by the RTA rules, forms can be filed with RTA if Landlords don’t follow RTA rules but it is not really a deterrent to them as there is no real consequence."
Affordability - more NRAS properties and private rentals in general need to allow pets.
Allow you to small animals in their home or without restrictions 
Make none payment of rent and tenant damage a criminal offence as its too widely abused under the currant laws.
"Rental agencies not completing or forwarding maintenance requests 
Limited flexibility for break lease under extenuating circumstances such as job relocation "
Real Estate Agents playing God.
"I'm an owner so it's difficult when tenants break the lease conditions by having more occupants or more pets on the property, disturbing the neighbours or using illegal drugs on the property. There is the 3 breach rule, but it must be for the same thing so when 3 breaches happen for 3 different things even though they are serious there is nothing you can do. Property managers don't always want to follow up."
information from agent that regognises the value oftenants-they do not have a business if we do not rent yet they respect the landlord but do not give us the same courtesy and ultimately there is no business if we do not pay the dollars follow the money trail!
Less intrusive/frequent  inspections and ability to have a pet
More pet friendly rentals 
I would like to not pay bulk water
Reassuring good tenants and minimising their fear of a bad record or retribution if they make maintenance requests for example
"Ability to make small changes to the property to make it a home e.g. put up proper picture hooks and replace some of the horrendous weeds the owner calls grass.  
Other countries have a return to status clause - the tenant would be responsible for returning the property to the original standard (or agreed standard if the changes improved the property) upon leaving.  Why can’t something similar be used here?"
Ability for pets without consultation with owners or real estate 
easier ways to find tenants that owe rent or trash the accommodation and leave.
Property managers need to be honest and consistent
Bond money has not covered damage or rent owed from tenants vacating.
"Real estates have too much power with regard to tenant credibility. It should be an independent body eg like Veda a credit reporting agency. Unfortunately if you have a menopausal agent or perhaps an agent going through a divorce, their judgement is clouded and this affects the tenants “reputation”"
"Make it easier to rent with pets. We only have one cat and haven't had too much trouble, but it has still limited our options."
Rentals shouldn't be allowed to rise in cost every year without the landlord investing anything into it to improve the quality or standard of the rental
"Better maintenance for the property, guarantees for verbal promises made in exchange for resigning a lease.

Guarantees that material defects or broken equipment will be repaired or replaced, instead of permament stopgap solutions."
"More flexibility, more rights as a tenant"
"As a landlord and a tenant; I've experienced both sides..the power the real estate agent holds over the tenant and the landlord and the RTA.
They're never responsible and always blame a third party. For what they do their fees are extremely expensive. "
Being able to on charge more expenses
"Tenants not respecting the property I.e. tenants parking cars all over the lawns and ruining the grass, not respecting the money taken to establish gardens and looking after them, tenants not doing minor repairs such as changing a tap washer, changing light bulbs, "
Better staffing training and procedures at the real estate agent
If your a good Tennant to be acknowledged in some kind of reward like an incentive to own your own home
"Reduce uncertainty about the owners/property managers/etc. Tenants give heaps of information about themselves so that landlords can decide whether they want to rent to us, but all we know is what the house looks like and any real estate agent reviews we can scrounge off the internet. It's just another imbalance of power that exists between renters and landlords."
Better protection for owners from damage caused by tenants.
"All houses / premises should have some form of security ie. screens / deadlocks etc.
"
Allowing pets to be kept in all rental properties. 
"Maintenance being completed.
Allowed to have pets.
Not being allowed to enter the premise when the tenants are not home.
Longer lease renewal "
Better real estate agent service. Everyone has a terrible real estate agent story 
The ability for landlords to offer longer term -say 3 year  - leases to good tenants.
How often inspections are done
The ability to transfer the bond from 1 property to another
Being able to have a dog and less inspections!
For rental property owners to take more responsibility in maintaining a property.
Tenants should be required to give more than 2 weeks notice before the end of their lease if they want to move out.
The expectations of the agents during an inspection
"Allow pets, wall hangings, painting etc
"
The rental price is going up yearly though the house is old and it’s getting older each year.  The real estate agents think about their benefits only
Improve the competence and ethics of propety managers
Make it easier to force landlords to do repairs. 
Honest real estate agents and landlords
speed up maintenance requests
More pet friendly rentals..
Not having to pay a new bond before you get your old bond back.
Make property managers more accountable for not doing their job or doing their job poorly.
Better security for the property.
"Renter's perspective  -. Entry inspection to compiled correctly including photos.
Landlord perspective - fear of tenants not paying and length of time it would take to evict. "
"The upfront rental bond should not be paid until the start date of the lease, not before. Also, if the bond is expected back from a previous rental, then the new rental owner should receive that bond plus or minus the new bond. "
Why does a landlord have to give 2 months notice to a tenant that they will not renew the tenants lease even though it is a fixed term agreement already.   why can a tenant leave giving only 2 weeks notice.   a landlord has to give 2 months and yet a tenant only has to give 2 weeks. this is discriminatory. 
"Based on my experience, the tenancy tribunal is biased in favour of tenants. I would like to see a more objective and balanced approach which treats both tenants and landlords fairly. It would be interesting to see the statistics on decisions taken by the tribunal in QLD"
"Allowance of pets, mandatory quality repairs of houses.

Landlords and real estates need not worry about the cleanliness of houses (unmade beds, etc)"
Tenants required to provide 4 weeks notice of intent to leave.
"Encourage longer term leases, where the property is rented, but can become more of a home. This allows for the possibility of a good working relationship between tenant, real estate and owner, and potentially encourages greater ""ownership"" of the property by the tenant (therefore perhaps less likely to mistreat it)"
Quicker response times to issues raised.
Being treated as a person not a someone that is a nuisance when i complain or ask for basic maintenance to be done.
More responsibility to force property managers to perform for the best interests of both parties
"Longer leases,being able to have pets at all rental property, can only again access to the property when tenants are home. "
Property managers never following through with repairs or maintenance 
Better treatment of tenants
Less expensive. Less strictness regarding pets and adding hooks to walls for pictures etc
A better paying job
"Allowing pets
Not putting up the rent every 12 months
Longer lease terms"
The expectation of that is put on renters to maintain the property would be accompanied by an expectation of the property manager to look after the tenants. We have to do things in such a short time period but we waited 6 weeks for any blinds when we moved in with no compensation.
"Allowing pets and minor modifications without requiring owner approval; limiting owner's ability to make excessive ""bond cleaning"" requirements"
If a rental property is placed  up for sale the tenant should be able to end the lease immediately with no penalties.
Make it easier to evict tenants who are in arrears with their rent.
Early termination on mutual terms.
More info on bad renters.
"More flexibility with allowing pets for renters. A minimum standard of safety (e.g. locks on doors, windows with screens). More transparency regarding body corporate rules and regulations and decisions that impact renters. "
the real estate agents and some of the landlords
High rents & poor maintenance
Mouldy fences and awnings not replaced after years of asking nicely without bothering the owners or real estate too much. 
It would be good for documentation to be lodged with the body who gets the bond so that arguments about the state of the house are more easily resolved.
Nothing. They seem to be quite fair.
Have some sort of mandatory training and rules for property managers. They all seem to be young and inexperienced
Real estate agents who are more customer service focused as some are very rude
Allowing tenants to take on a periodical lease and a 3 month lease and not be locked into a 6 month or 12 month lease.  Due to work commitments etc their needs to be flexibility to tenants.
options for tenants to have smaller leases and landlord not dictate terms
"Having more freedom to make the place a home.
Small changes like hooks, gardening, a cat. 
Also real estate agents that respond to maintenance requests. "
Have landlords fix issues 
"As a renter, being able to attach picture hooks etc to walls. Getting things fixed in a timely manner.

As a landlord, being able to evict tenants who are frequently behind on rent more easily."
Longer lease terms for more security 
"Being an older lonely person it is imperative I have pets for my physical, emotional and mental health."
"More protection for landlords, I’ve had a tenant sign a 12m lease to then claim hardship in early December and walk away with no financial penalty, so close to Xmas the property didn’t rent for 2 months, I went from a secure leased position to a financial disaster- there’s already no consideration for landlords financial position, it’s all about making sure the tenant doesn’t lose money, make it worse again for landlords and I’ll remove my 3 rentals from the market and invest in shares"
improve tenants accountability
"1, In relation to ""quiet enjoyment"", landlords should be able to exclude items where a safety issue is involved.
2. In the current legislation where pets are excluded,it is vague about pets brought to the premises by a visitor. It should be the Tenant's responsibility to ensure no pets are on the premises."
"Rental law favor tenant. Owner is considered as villain. As landlord I have incurred loss as tenant will leave property unclean, in serious damage, won't pay rent last few weeks. To recover rent minimum you get is bond where as damage is higher.  "
"The ability to get proper reimbursement of repairs from tenants. Binds do not reflect this, especially when tenants don't pay their last month's rent."
"More communication with property managers, "
"Pets allowed in all rentals
Less inspections ... right to be present and not have steangers wandering in my home"
Choose a bigger house next time 
"Less inspections, less nit picking over dust 

Quicker response from landlords and all houses should have security screens and doors and secure fencing "
Water consumption cost be fully borne by the tenants to reduce irresponsible over-consumption by some of them.
Less barriers to renters having pets 
Landlord fixing things and less inspections every 12 weeks during a long term tenancy is too much 
More affordable and nice rentals to allow pets
I would like my rent to NOT increase because pets are alowed in rentals without the owners permission
The costs are a bit high.
"Public housing for people with disabilities, mental instability & safe housing for kids, people, in crisis situations"
Real estate agents attitudes & behaviour towards tenants - improve on the awareness of tenant rights vs real estate agents also. 
Renters being allowed pets in their rentals 
Tenants of rentals should be given more rights within the home they are living in. We should not have to risk giving up our beloved pets due to biased owners. 
"Current rental is looked after well, but in the past some agencies have taken a very long time to get back to tenants about anything"
Long term options
"By having a separate site/listing for pet friendly properties, this way you dont have to go through 50 or more listings to find pet friendly ones."
Allow Renters to take action against Body Corporate in Court for not enforcing their own Bylaws and or amend Bylaws that have Typos and Bylaws that make no sense. If Body Corporate at fault Body Corporate and its Manager should bear court costs and related costs.
not being treated badly by agents
Tenant being able to feel at home but also pay for costs for what they have done etc
"The bond return process, ie real estate agents doing everything they can to not return your bond ie being dishonest. I find that incredibly stressful and upsetting. And being able to hang pictures on the walls. And no photos taken of my property at house inspections. "
Better communication between agencies and owners for prompt repairs. Also streamlining the rental application process so that all the forms are the same would be great. I've had some forms where your birth certificate is worth 60 points and others where it's only worth 10! I've also lived somewhere where large holes in the security screen which allowed someone to reach through and unlock the door (therefore breaking in very easily) were never fixed despite being put on the inspection report and repair request MULTIPLE times over the course of 18 months. 
Having the NRAS scheme going longer for people with disability
"If I could only change one thing, I would make property management subject to regulation. As someone who has been both a landlord and a tenant, I believe the property management industry is overly focused on lowering cost than on ensuring they serve landlords and tenants."
"Fewer rental inspections, especially if you’ve shown to have a good history. "
"The affordability of houses to rent.
If you have pet much harder to find a place.
Landlords can be painful at times."
The Residental Tenants Authority. This is biased toward the landlord and provides little or no support to the tenant.
Tenants feeling empowered to notify real estate/property manager/landlord of faults. Ie lived in a house with no working oven for 12 months as worried would be kicked out for complaining. 
To allow for tenants to have pets. 
Ask lots of questions and get the answers on paper before moving in
Looking at long term renting and how that can be improved 
"It always took the agency forever to organise repairs.  This felt like an extra slap in the face when every 6 months our rent would go up, despite our salaries not going up either. "
"They need to make having animals in houses easier.  Charge an extra bond if need be.

Be fairer with wear and tear.  I have had to pay a fortune for what was clearly wear and tear for houses."
Ease of renting with pets
Reward the good tenants who do the right thing. 
More respect for renters from property managers
"Less frequent inspections and at end of 12 month lease, lease continues without needing to sign up for another set period."
"Be able to take leases for longer than 12 months - ie, 3 years so that you can plan your life better and with confidence "
Ability to alter lease time constraints.
Renting prices and increasing 
"Remove ability to increase rent by such large amounts every 6 months.
"
"Real estate agents that actually do their job, attend to repairs in a timely matter, don’t rip people off for unrealistic expectations on exit cleans, poor communication, bullying people into leases when only an extension is required"
"Bond amounts, collection and refund."
"Inspections should be once or twice a year if first 3 inspections check out, "
Less frequent inspections are 
I make a way for the owner of properties to be in trouble if they are not foxing the problems on the house. And i would also make illegal to discriminate against pets. 
Have letting agents improve their level of service and oversight of tenants to ensure problems such as rent arrears and maintenance don't escalate.
We are long term renters and spend 4+ years in each property until increases in rent drive us out. Long term fixed rent would be amazing. 
Providing certainty about leasing.  Could we have longer leases?
Onus on landlords to fix things in a reasonable time frame 
"Less frequent inspections by the agent at short notice. We continually get silly inspections without adequate notice or reason despite the property being kept in A1 condition and it disrupts our lives and privacy. 

The owner has passed on connection fees related to permanent infrastructure installation to the property to us as the first tenant. We find this very unfair as we are only intending on being in the property for a short period of time. These costs should be paid by the owner and then re-couped via the rent paid for the property so that they are evenly paid by all tennants that have the benefit of their use rather than all costs for the ridiculous NBN network being lumped in one tennants lap, in our opinion the government should be changing the law to ensure this does not happen, it is currently skewed policy."
Better landlord-property management-tenant cohesion
Longer time to fill in condition report
It would be great to have a better and more consistent system for tracking maintenance requests and things that need fixing 
Tenants have to many rights and it’s too hard to evict them for continued late payment of rent
"a complete overhaul of the Government Department of Housing experience for those disadvantaged youth to adults from homelessness, disabilities and coming out of incarceration.
Proper management of community properties and housing commission housing and social housing.  "
Government run black list
Property owners being more accountable for the state of the property. Repairs and maintenance happening when required and without undue delay. Rental reductions for delays in repairs and maintenance would be a great motivator. Tenants need protection against unreasonable landlords who expect a property that has been lived in to have no wear or tear (it's a cost of doing business - some of the rent received needs to be set aside to cover this. The bond should not be used to pay for wear and tear.).
Simplify the process and cut red tape
"Having a written lease when first renting instead of believing a verbal. We were young and did not know.  Landlord tried keeping our bond.  We won. 
Also RE lying about a house being next door to feral bogan housing commission.  She knew and lied to us. "
Consequences for tenants doing property damage
Be able to collect money awarded to us by QCAT owed by tenants.  Police know where they are.  Centrelink know where they are. ATO know where they are. We cant collect.  We should be able to garnish through centrelink.  We are on lower income than centrelink recipients. Be able to access Tenant Database as private managers (only Real Estate agents can) .  RTA will not answer questions relating to their forms ie Lease Document if being managed by RE.  RE wouldnt give us a copy of lease as owners.  RTA wouldnt advise if this is a requirement or not.
"Longer leased for long term renters, so rent increases can only happen every 5 years. "
Tighter controls over property managers and owners to ensure that they do not mistreat tenants
Cheaper rent and more autonomy as a tenant - I currently have to sign my lease 4 months in advance when its time for re-newal!!
"Holding tenants accountable for the damage done to a house and the damage to the house their pet has caused ie scratched entry doors, ripped fly screens, lawn reduced to nothing. At the moment the laws etc are heavily in the tenants favour. "
I’d really like to see landlords and real estate agents move faster on issues in the property that need fixing. I just feel like renters are considered a low priority.
The massive power imbalance held by property owners and managers
I would have higher bond fees to allow for those tenants that don't do the right thing. 
Real estates and landlords who utilise your bond to fix issues that were not caused by your tenancy
Decrease allowable frequency of inspections 
Distructive tenants given less rights to stay in your rental
Rents that keep going up
Take away smoking on balconies 
The bond of 4 weeks is inadequate. Notice periods require at least 6 weeks just to cover rent let alone any damage to the property. 
"I would not rely on a real estate agents ""word of mouth"" information and would require all aspects of a rental in writing before committing to a rental agreement. I have been mislead in a past rental in the Brisbane market."
"More places allowing pets on a case by case basis, lots of properties online say pets neg but you turn up to inspect and turns out the owners mean a fish or a bird, not dogs. Also, inspections 6 monthly if you’ve always paid rent on time and house is clean, tidy, damage free etc. "
the bond doesnt work.  Renters stop paying rent and the bond gets used up before they leave the property.
"More flexibility in what you can do with your rental. More power around requesting repairs on the property. More power in negotiation of price. Not have to show receipt of professional clean to get bond back if you can clean it yourself up to standard. Not have to make the property in better condition when you leave then you received it in. 
I know where to find information around rentals and rights but it is missing a lot of info and when you ring up you often get referred back to the agent which is why I was generally calling in the first place to find out my rights beforehand "
"Property Mangers need to understand Maintenance & Building Matters, rather than being a typical Sales Persons, they are caring for Property worth up to $1m, they need to understand what they are really responsible for,."
The owner needs to take more responsibility for repairs
"Not being penalised for having children or pets.
Property managers and owners entering property constantly. Not illegally but always inventing Reasons we received 14 entry notices in the last quarter And felt we couldn’t refuse."
Fewer inspections and intrusions
Ability to sign CPI indexed long term leases (out to 5yr)
Having landlords send water bills 3 monthly
"Quicker response time by Rental Bond authority to release bond, long delays after both parties had signed off."
"Cheaper rent, more accessible and affordable housing options."
To have less restrictions put on us as tenants.
Not go with untrustworthy and unprofessional  property managers.
"Longer leases.
More freedom: things like hang pictures on wall, paint a wall, plant a tree."
Being able to recoup losses from Tenant damage as bonds rarely cover costs
The expectation on inspections and allow family pets.
"Properties must conform to a minimum standard of operation for all facilities; i.e. stove must work, exhaust fans must work, front door should lock securely, sewerage must operate without backing up, etc."
HAVING LONG TERM TENANTS
State of properties when moving in sometimes filthy and rental agencies expect you to have it immaculate on exit otherwise will keep your bond!
Nothing. It seems fine the way it is.
Less red tape
If tenants are behind in their payment more than 4 weeks they can be asked to leave.
"repairs done promptly, less bullying by real estate agents and owners"
"Better regulation of housing inspections and beginning vs end of lease bond matters. Often, i will move into a house that requires professional cleaning on arrival, but then will be penalised heavily for any minor mess (including dust that has settled that day) that remains after I vacate"
Better insurance coverage and fees
Increased bond to cover the cost of damage to property and loss of rent
"Landlords who use renters as an opportunity to make upgrades on their house by taking bonds at the end of a rental agreement, and real estate agents helping them do so. "
"Get QCAT to make consistent rulings, not to have 2 identical cases and get 2 different rulings. The judicators should actually read the files in full that were prepared by parties before the hearing."
"Continue to have a say regarding pets. Our rental in Qld will eventually be our retirement home. I suffer severely from animal fur, especially cats. You can have the house cleaned from top to bottom and I can still detect cat hair.  I visit friends who have outdoor pets and still have reactions inside the house!"
"When I asked permission to have a pet it came with SO many conditions. I would lose so many benefits and had to pay for extra pest control, carpet cleaning and more!!!"
"Greater protection for landlords; swifter termination of leases. Currently when tenants stop paying rent, by the time you can access the property the bond is exhausted and there are no avenues to re-coup costs. So many tenants are poor, and instigating legal processes are fruitless."
Make it easier to have pets. 
The power imbalance - the only real step a renter can take if a property owner is not dealing appropriately is to leave which is highly costly and disruptive. 
Tenants can cause damage  n walk away  free my only recourse is a bond which does not always cover costs
Better maintenance of property 
Pets are not permitted to live in a unit.
The amount of inspections. A fair amount would be 6 monthly perhaps after you have rented 1 year the same house or shown to respect the home you rent
Make it easier to remove tenants not paying their rent
"Making tenants more accountable for how they treat my investment property. They destroy furniture and so forth and get away it. The bond isn't even enough to cover damages. Yet the Government wants to further strip rights of landlords? As it is, tenants already have more rights. If tenants want more rights, then they should go and buy their own unit."
Find an affordable apartment with the expense extremely high in Brisbane. 
Greater recall on tenants who trash or damage the property 
"I hate 3 monthly inspections... after the first few, they knew I was a good tenant. 
"
Property managers need to be appropriately professional when corresponding with tenants. Condescending or patronizing remarks are neither necessary nor appropriate. Such remarks can also be akin bullying therefore all correspondence should remain strictly professional.
"Stronger rights for tenants that give them the ability to enforce necessary maintenance and repairs in a timely manner.
In my experience, enforcing your rights by breaching the landlord etc will lead to them issuing you with a notice to leave for the lease end date (i.e. not renewing lease). They may also refuse to provide a rental reference as they see you as a ‘troublemaker’."
Attitude towards renters exhibited by 98% of Real Estate Office staff 
"Ability to negotiate lower rent during a holiday that's taken away from the premises, and pay higher amount upon return. Eg. take two weeks' holiday at half rent, then repay normal rent plus half in following two weeks. "
"The current system, works well, except, damage by tenants, is never properly addressed. "
SMS contact from agent. I don’t use my hotmail email regularly but always answer messages.
Make tenants accountable - a code of conduct where the government fine them for breaches. Stop making Landlords the overlords of the underclass.
"Communication between tenant-landlord and realestate. I'm in a house full of mould been here 2 years now and informed them of it when i moved in, still nothing done about it."
Tenants be allowed to have pets at the property 
Having a GOvernment authority that is willing to give FREE legal advice to both landords/agents and tenants.
Make land agents more accountable for their actions
I would change a fairer system with regards to notices and bond refunds
The application process is very difficult and at times not fairly handled by agents.
At least 8 weeks bond allowing to be charged by agents and landlords.
Dislike government regulations that cost money
Make it so that tenants cannot be given a notice to leave for no reason.
Not have owners/landlords rock up when they want. Also fix things when they need to be fixed.
House inspections. to be completed yearly instead of 3 monthly. 
Affordability relative to median wage. 
That contracted property management be trained and their methods are monitored more closely to ensure they are complying with department guidelines.
"If tennants are capable of doing very minor repairs and are confident, then this would save the property owner a lot of money instead of getting costly contractors in, but only with owner permission and only if they are confident."
Less ambiguity in the act and more clear definitions of responsibilities and penalties for tenants whom don’t leave the property in the same condition 
"I get concerned when owners change agents, & not all of the file is passed on with any issues from the start as then they put the blame on the tenant, & it can be quite hard to fight it, even with photos of my own.
The other thing I find hard is breaking a lease early the costs involved & fees. I think if enough notice was given it should be ok."
"Rent paid to my agent on time, tenants can pay a few days after a due date and no action can be taken but I cannot pay my mortgage a few days late without a penalty "
"An agency that offers more than one way to pay rent that does not cost the tenant anything and to be able to install picture hooks without removing them upon vacate (I don't want that many on every wall just one here and there, happy to have landlord approval)."
Being able to feel like it is my home and able to put photos etc on the wall.
"Being able to have my pets with me in my rental property, they are my babies and I cannot do without them.

Also, the bond process is too expensive.  We should be able to lodge a bond and add to or take away from it if we get all our bond back or even top it up if moneys are taken out to pay for things in the bond at the end of the lease.  That way we wouldn't have to keep coming up with four weeks rental (bond) every time that we move."
Allowing pets in all rental properties in accordance with council/body corporate rules
"Real estate agents not being so discriminative and having more empathy and understanding of people's lives. 
More free legal support for tenants "
Better communication with real estate agencies 
I find it hard to get a house being a young single mum 
Quicker time to evict tenants who do not pay rent or cause major damage to premises
Not having problems resolved when maintanence issues arise...is only 1 of many.
Renters need to  be provided with better resources and access to preliminary advice about how to respond to issues that arise from realtors.
I find overall that tenants do not look after my property. Things as basic as everyday cleanliness is a major concern. I do have stable long term tenants however there is a low care factor overall. 
"A reduction in the cost of renting, particularly in suburbs surrounding the city."
"Acknowledgement the house I am renting, while is owned by a third party, is my home.  I have been renting for over 20 years and many of the property managers I have come across treat you as a commodity and someone who is going to damage the property or some other (sometimes perceived) discretion.  I have had my house keeping challenged (unpaired socks sitting on a chest of drawers), dangerous repairs not completed (rotting stairs and loose hand rails). These contribute to you feeling like a second class citizen (as does the role media plays in vilifying tenants and society in making home ownership the gold standard)."
"We have been renting with a good landlord for 4 years in this location.  She wants us to stay for a long time.  It would be nice to have an option where instead of every 3 months inspections for EXCEPTIONAL people who take care of the property, to have our inspections reduced to once every 6 months.  "
I haven't had any problems over the past 20 years with  renting my properties
Landlords cannot refuse tenants with pets 
Bring notice periods for tenants and owners into line.
"The notice period difference for owner and tenant. 
2 months vs 2 weeks is not fair, benefits the tenant only, and leaves the owner open to  sudden vacancy and/or have disgruntled tenants by forcing an owners hand to accommodate the 2 months notice period. 
Further, even after an owner has issued NTL, a tenant can still beat it with their own NTL with just 2 weeks notice. "
Allow more rights to owners
"Improved bond return claims. To often do real-estate or owners claim some of the renters bond at the end of a tenancy for damage/repairs/cleaning that is falsified. As a renter, rather than go through the process of QCAT it is less of a hassle to adsorb the bond claim (as often it is only a small amount). Tough problem to fix though as there are a small amount of renters that do actually damage/steal from properties.       "
"The ability to personalize the property eg...hang pictures, landscape."
"1. I would change having to complete a 6 month lease after living in the rental for 7 years. A notice period would be better e.g. one month. Having the risk to pay out the 6 months if the unit can't be rented to someone else doesn't make sense.

2. Sorry I have more. I completed a 6 month lease (after 7 years in that rental) and the real estate was allowed to show the unit before i left. I had paid rent and that got me the dubious privilege of having to share it with random strangers. I should get a discount on rent if I no longer have the place to myself.

3. Real Estates check for dust in an inspection. If dust was going to cause damage I can understand, but they do a house work inspection. Real Estates need to be better trained on what can happen in an inspection. Below is what I received
""We came into the unit to do a routine inspection but it was messy and dirty. Therefore, we have rescheduled the inspection to next Thursday. 
Please could you tidy up and clean the property before Thursday 14th June 2018 as we need to send the report to landlord with photos. ""

4. I would like better defined rules about photographing during an inspection. My current manager takes photos of the contents of the medicine cabinet and then sends it to the owners in China. The contents of the medicine cabinet have no bearing on the units condition.
"
As an owner I would like to have greater security in the protection of my asset. I have been burnt by tenants causing damage to my property and under RTA its deemed as wear and tear on the property when its been caused my the tenant not taking the care or looking after the property.  
Fair rules for both Landlord and Tenant
"As a landlord of investment properties, I believe that tenants have way too many rights. To only have to give 2 weeks notice to leave and we have to give 2 months notice. It should at lease me 4 weeks each to give time to sort out a new suitable tenant. We are the ones taking the risk (investing) to give people a home and maintain it to a standard yet get blamed if anything goes wrong. The tenants seem to be able to get away with whatever they want at the expense of the landlord. I have many friends who are investors and we discuss this regularly and most want to sell out and invest in other areas as the returns are not good and the tenants have all the rights. Imagine if it gets too hard for investors and many sell up. There will be a shortage of properties and rents will go up and many people wont be able to find a suitable home. This needs to be considered!"
Being able to have my do g at any property that is suitable.
"Make tenants pay their own water rates, same as Electricity / phone . This would eliminate the grey area around excess water usage."
More power/rights to agents/owners in how tenants look after properties
"Generally I'd prefer if property managers were more proactive and didn't require 5 follow up emails for a simple repair, and if there was more recourse for action against poor/ negligent property managers. "
Tenants to take  more responsibility in managing their personal monies and not leave the owners with the problem of following up regarding rent money and vacating property.  
Cheaper rental rates
"To be able to put up pictures of my family on the walls, and to be able to have pets"
More timely responses when submitting maintenance requests.
Extended nras properties for family’s that need it the most 
"tenants should pay more bond money (maybe 6 weeks) to help protect the landlord
the laws need to change to help landlords more -too many rights for tenants"
Improve affordability for singles and make it easier for pet owners to rent (particularly if the dog is over 10kg)
"More balanced laws to protect both owners and tenants alike. I am a property manager and I also rent myself, so I can see both sides of the picture."
"A central application database for tenant applications that agents can access when a tenant applies for a property. 
An ""UBER"" rating system for Tenants and Landlords."
"How little power owners/managers have over problem tenants. 
People can walk out without paying rent, without even cleaning.
When the issue is taken to QCAT the judges let them off & the owner is left with the bill.
Its a consistent theme throughout the court system in Australia that says its easier to live off the dole & make it someone else's issue. "
"More promotion of information available to renters about their rights and responsibilities, because real estates often take advantage of tenants not knowing their rights and rely on lack of knowledge to achieve their own goals. "
More Pet friendly properties 
Able to have animals at properties
"Too much paperwork between the application, lease, body corporate by-laws, etc. can this be reduced? "
"The process of returning bond. Had my bond incorrectly lodged under someone else's name by my realtor and was told the only thing I was told I could do was contact them and have them pay me back. 
After weeks of back and forth calls with the RTA and my realtor I managed to find an alternative.
It took at least 3 months to have the money returned after my lease had ended and there were no repercussions for the property group so they could easily do it again to another poor person. "
The tenancy laws to being in favour of the landlord 
The rental rules when ending the lease 
"Landlords to be held accountable for repairs which are technically emergency repairs within a certain time frame, and not being able to refuse repairs that could potentially be a hazard. "
"Tennant responsibilities are clear especially if staying in property a number of years e.g. carpets must be cleaned every two years, pest control must be undertaken annually etc "
"To be able to put in a breach of tenancy to make owners repair the property without being treated with hostility and unfairly by the real estate- by nasty emails, giving bad references when vacating or listing you on ticca without reason. 
To be able to report property managers for being nasty and making false accusations. I am now at the point where I'm afraid to check my emails because of the tension, just over me asking for repairs and saying I dont want to accept a rental increase without the repairs being done."
"The power that a Property Manager has over their tenant.  Our complex has a large number of single mums, most have been in DV, they are vulnerable to the Managers bullying.  Everyone lives in fear of losing their home.  Demands such as ""you must have minimalistic style, you have too much furniture"" has forced tenants to reduce their belongings to barely functional.  When a stove top dies it takes approx. a month to have it repaired,  requests to have security locks put on doors are refused.  Water pours through exterior light fittings when it rains - 5 years on it is still not repaired despite being listed on inspection reports.  We cannot put in formal complaints as we have been told that if we do, we will be turfed out.  During one of my inspections she so verbally violent I ended up calling the police & had to go to the Doctors with a racing heart.  She threatens rent rises beyond our means if we follow any queries up.  The threat of not having our leases renewed (without reason) keeps some of us living with our curtains closed - she complains in newsletters about water usage - saying she's seen some tenants washing or rinsing dishes under running water.  She then demands that all recycling must be rinsed.  If we dry our clothes on a clothes rack inside we are told we are creating a fire hazard and can be breached.  She then demands we use the dryer provided (broken & reported but not fixed), she even demanded to see our power bills when we advise we don't want to run bill up by using dryer.  She has complete power over us - The REIQ and QStars can only advise us to move as if we challenge her she won't renew lease, and having our leases not renewed due to a challenge can't be successfully fought in court - and if it is done so they will find another way to get us out.  We can't even make contact to the overseas owner to advise them of the state of lack of maintenance being done on the property as everything goes back to the managers address.  They are charging for lawn mowing, however it is approx. 2 months between each mow.  We have tried discussing with the strata managers however their hands are tied.  The bodycorp is non-contactable.  The property manager openly abuses children living in the complex, and also openly abuses visitors to the complex.  We need a safe avenue that guarantees that our homes/leases are safe when we make a complaint.  My children have awoken at night to noise and we have found the manager and her husband in our back yard (between 11pm - 1am).  They say they were 'chasing someone' through the complex. Not so.  We are stuck due to cost of rental hiking up and being in 'school zone'.  Manager has advise if she gets any of us out, we will not be able to get another rental in the school zone as she knows as the local agents etc.  We cannot even hang a single photo on a wall, so home cannot be a real home despite being here five years."
"The real estate makes it soo hard because anything that breaks or doesn't work, your made to feel it's your fault and you walk on eggshells for fear of being told to leave.  Also, tenants need dump vouchers.  Most tenants want to keep the house clean but have to pay to go to the dump"
Have the property managers understand that the house is being lived in when they come for inspections 
"Improve the standard of agents. There are many who are dishonest, aggressive and useless. The tenant is vulnerable, and a number of agents take advantage of this. For example, unannounced inspections, bond disputes.
There needs to be minimum training for agents and an effective complaints process. "
More rights for Landlords. Make notice period to leave the same for tenants and landlords.
Make it the law that we are allowed to have a cat in any rental property. 
"Being able to make adjustments to the house, for example hanging items on the wall"
The legal right to access my rental property if I have reasonable grounds that my asset is being disrespected and damaged.
When there is an issue with the property and it is taken to the RTA re the bond refund the landlord should be able to be present and informed during the process. Currently the process only includes the rental agent. I had a serious issue with my rental agent and the tenant lease was terminated the damage cost over $8k and the agent only claimed about $200 from the bond of $1200 despite me advising them I was requesting the entire bond and I also asked to be present at the medication. The agent ignored my requests as I had move the rental to a new agency and I lost $1000 in bond due to the current process.
Make it easier for young people to get rental properties. I have found that a lot of owners won’t rent to younger people.
"I find that when a tenant is in arrears it takes a long time to evict a tenant. You issue the remedy breach and notice to leave which I don't have an issue with. But if the tenant does not vacate and a warrant of possession is required, in our area it takes estimated 6 weeks for the hearing. Then another week for the police to implement. So you are looking at about 9+ weeks the tenant is in arrears. "
"Real estate agents have all the information and therefore have all the power. Tenants usually don't know their rights and get over powered by real estate agents in regards to ending a tenancy, vacating a property and sometimes repairs"
"Change bond from 4 to 6 weeks rent - 4 weeks is not enough to cover the significant costs involved from damage to a property and rental loss. 
Make wanton damage to a property a criminal offence punishable with jail time. People get away with it with little penalty and do it over again to some other poor landlord."
Tenants allowed to hang pictures and pets approved regardless. 
"as a property owner i find the council rates to be exorbitant, the water bills take 3 months to process from meter read to bill arrival. In other states it takes less than 14 days which shows how 1) either the admin employees are totally lazy or 2) the system is so fucked up you should farm it out to a private company."
I agree with the small improvements without permission such as hooks and gardens but only to a small extent
"Give greater protection to landlords.
Ensure fairness of compliance with agreement in regards especially in relation to the payment of rent. 
Make it clear to people who rent that their income from welfare support or from the employer can be garnished to recover rent not paid or damage done to property.
Maybe we need a survey of landlords to identify the number of instances where tenants escape payment of rent because the follow up necessary through the court system is onerous. Also needed is the Quantum of loss per year sustained by landlords.

"
Regulation on rent increases.
If maintenance is not carried out within a timely manner then the tenant should be able to engage workmen to undertake the work and deduct this from rental amount.
Tenant should pay for full water cost including connection just like telephone and power
"Landlords are losing more and more rights regarding the property they own. And tenants are being given more and more free reign.
I think notice periods need to become equal. If landlords have to give tenants 2 months notice to vacate, its fair that tenants should have to give 2 months notice to vacate. How is a landlord to prepare for a vacant property when they only have 2 weeks notice for when the tenant leaves."
Equal notice periods to apply for landlords and tenants
That tenants should be made to pay their rent on time before they use up the bond they've paid.  As there can be problems at the end of tenancy that the bond is supposed to cover and if they haven't paid rent for the last 4 weeks of the tenancy you have to try and chase them up to recoup any expenses that you've incurred because of this.
Allowing pets in the property
"2 months notice to tenants is too long of a period, both for the lessor and tenant. In most circumstances where tenants are given two months notice to vacate they cannot end their agreement earlier should they find suitable alternate accommodation. With tenants only needing to provide 14 days / 2 weeks some properties are not readily available for tenants who are given 2 months notice to vacate, causing unnecessary angst, stress and frustration about the moving / relocating process"
"Change the Notice to Leave period and Notice of Intention to Leave notice period to 30 days in writing from either party. 

Tenants are unable to break their fixed term lease agreement without QCAT approval and must be held to rent owed. 

Harsher penalties for Tenants who abscond or damage property with malice. "
"A realistic valueing system for rental properties, taking into consideration the geographic location, age of home, features of the house ect. i know this exsists but largely the geographic location should be a considerable factor. Also rent prices should stay the same whether a Complany or a person rents it and therfore this should help keep the rental market true for that area. 
PS Check out Barcaldine Qld 4725"
"Improve rights of renters
"
More difficulties with property managers than the tenant
"Tenants do not care for your properties. They think every landlord is rich and expect every little thing to be addressed by a callout no matter what the cost to the owners.
Insurance company's charge high prices for landlord insurance and then word the policy so that they can avoid paying out to the landlord for substantiated damage under various excuses. They all do this. Tenants have more rights than landlords.   "
better fairer decisions from qcat 
I've never rented in Queensland but own investment properties there.
I had to pay for a new phone line to be put in to my last rental so that I could acess the internet. It should be considered part of the infrastructure and be the owners responsibility to install.
Allowing Pets at all properties and more flexible policy on wall hanging etc.
Better terms to ensure real estate agents are approachable and that they are more focused on the renter as they are the ones paying the rent.
Flexibility to pay rent. Most real estates have an online debit service which charges a fee on top of the rent 
Make it more financially affordable
Clearer forms for renting as well as proper inspections (done by a professional) so the real estate can't get away with forcing new tenants to pay for old damage. 
The ability to put up a picture on the wall without some officious real Estate agent lording her power over me. To reduce the number of inspections and stop them taking photos inside my home. It's very invasive and humiliating.  I have rented in UK and Spain and was never treated like this. 
stricter rules around bond to help support property owners and managers (eg. when tennant at fault)
"More defined time frames for trades people entering the property ie a 4 hour window 
mandatory pest control every 18 months from the landlord
mandatory flea sprays by professionals for tenant that have pets at there own expense
Property managers/owners to be able to breach for objectional behaviour

"
Cheaper rental prices
"lengthen contract time to 2, 3 or 5 years with option for rent increase if necessary."
Full comprehension from tenants that if a property is offered in an immaculate and pristine condition that it is not unreasonable for the landlords to expect the property to be vacated in the same condition.  Wear and tear acceptable but not damage to contents and the dwelling.  
"Having landlords follow the rules for maintenance times. 
Tenants who think they own the house and demand everything and do not look after the property as they should. Tenants who cry on the phone to the RTA staff because they know they will get exactly what they want. Having more details available re sites like TICA for owner/managers, so we can access information to make the best decisions about new applications. "
"Higher bonds. 
Allow pets in more properties. "
QCAT to be able to get to cases quickly.  Tenants that are in 2 months rent arrears or more or damage of property should have an automatic eviction.
To be able to rent long term without having to worry about moving.
Make it easier for rental home owners to be compensated for damage done to rental properties by tenants who think they can damage the property and get away with it.
People should have option to move out of rental even before the end of lease by providing a reasonable notice (2 months).
"The supply of housing is too low. The rental prices are so high we've already decided that we will be moving out of Australia. I have a doctorate and a number of years experience in medicine, I have a lot of good connections both nationally and internationally, but I am not going to remain in AU and pay these prices for low-quality rental stock."
"I am a manager of a property management  department
Simplify the legislation further 
Allow Centrepay to be enforcable while tenants are on centrelink. If they have bad history they are often excluded from legitimate agencies and Owners are less likely to accept them however if we could guarantee the rent would be paid by centrelink? "
The balance of tenants and property owners rights - QLD laws are favoring tenants.
"Less inspections, longer leases, allowance for pets"
"Inspections every 3 months, it is an impost on the privacy of tenants"
"The property should be a blank canvas upon entry and be allowed to make it a home. Supply my own curtains and furnishings and hang photos etc. 
I also believe when exiting the property I should pay to have it put back to the original condition and patch and paint the entire walls. They do this in America. 
This way people are encouraged to stay longer than 12 months lease. 
Perhaps a painting bond should take place as well. And longer leases. "
Being able to screen tenants better
"I believe the tenant should have more control over the house they're renting. It is a tenants home for the time being. Tenants should be able to have pets (provided they pay a pet bond or equivalent), hang photos (provided they pay to have this rectified upon moving out) and agree to certain times/days for inspections. Inspections should be at a time that suits both parties, not just the rental agency/landlord. Mainly, it is just a matter of if you are unable to make that specific time/date, you have an unknown person inside your home, inspecting. With the possibility of the inspector to forget to lock to door, leave a tap running, accidentally leave a side gate open, etc. "
I would change nothing at the moment - I think the rules as they currently stand are fair to all parties. I have not had any adverse experiences as a landlord.
"Respect from property managers, and the property managers advocating for our requests to the owner. Tenants/renters are not sub-human, nor should they be viewed as lower class. Yet this is what happens. "
I would like info on the neighbours and neighbourhood made available before signing lease
Tenants being more obligated to paying their rent on time.
I think the tenant should pay for all of their water usage.
Better regulation of property agents.
Communication from the agency. Hanging pictures on walls 
Allow the tenant to make changes that will improve the home or enhance their home while they are living there. e.g: allow shelving or pictures to be put up (without using 3M). Allow furniture to be attached to walls for safety when living with children. Allow small pets to live in the property. 
Provision of current complete and accurate information to tenants before contracts are signed.
Be able to take action against unscrupulous landlords without being denied a further tenancy term
lower rental prices
Bond refund process - enable transfer between properties 
"More rights as a renter regarding rental increases, bond returns and rights to remain"
As always lower rent.
Ability to use the bond from previous rental for a new rental without javing to fork it out and wait to get it back.
"Notice periods, I do not believe it is fair that an Owner has to give 2 months notice to end a tenancy and a tenant only has to give 2 weeks, this is a massive difference and it isn't fair to the Owner. "
Better communication between all parties involved 
Tenants to pay for full water usage
Less bond. Pets allowed. 
If routine inspections could be no more than every four months during the tenancy instead of the current three months. Making three routine inspections per year rather than four.
I think a lot of renting places need to be more family safe
Specialist adjudicators to hear court cases. 
No fees for paying rent 
The renting industry needs to be regulated like any other industry with legislative code of conduct and ethics breaches punishable by law.
stop changing the rules so that leases are no longer really valid with adjudicators not caring about the act.
Be allowed to hang pictures on the walls
Have the tenant take greater responsibility for maintaining the rental property
Tenants should be able to refuse smokers
Make tenants to be more responsible for damages they caused to the property 
Lessors need to have more rights when it comes to renting their property. 
"More scrutiny on the behaviour and actions of builders/building companies, especially those who also take a paid management position with the building after construction and then fail to do any work or respond to tenants."
To receive respect from Real Estate companies and more opportunities to negotiate rent prices. More important is to be tr ewated with respect.
"More lenient laws about modifying property such as nails, hooks, or painting, as well as pets."
The only down side to renting is the occasional lengthy period of time which it can take for issues to be rectified. Commonly I hear it takes months to fix a simple maintenance issue. Ideally i would like there to be a reasonable period of time for action to be taken as the approved standard of a property is agreed upon on signing a contract and should be kept to that standard.
"More rentals to allow pets, more freedom to make small changes around the house"
More accountability for Property Managers
Owners need to be responsible for keeping up with basic repairs
Tenants abiding by the conditions in thee rental agreement
More support for tenants when real estate agents are unreasonable or if a tenant needs to challenge the real estate against actions against them .  Especially for younger renters 
"Landlords should not be allowed to auction of available properties. 
I know this is already a rule but many do not have the property properly cleaned but expect it better then how they give it to you. 
All real estate agents and Landlord’s should have to finilise the bond forms and final inspections on the final day of the lease, tenants cannot move in before the bond is secured so the same rule should apply leaving. 
Punishment for landlords who do not fix anything that is faulty. "
"ensure tenants take better care of property, holes in yard, no grass from dogs. 
rent paid on time.
rent not paid at end of lease so they use up bond and nothing left to do repairs and cleaning etc."
Being able to hang things on the walls
Better security when landlords decide to sell rental properties during a tenancy. 
"'Increase tenant statements: 
- Never have/is not currently using drugs, ice, meth etc  
- Never have/is not undergoing medications for mental conditions
- Do not need or have an emergency carer/contact to help me communicate relating to conditions such as PTSD, depression, Bipolar etc
- 
"
"Bad landlord or real-estate register.  To move in somewhere have things go sour and find out they have a history of doing it, isn't  fair. 
*not lodging bond in full.  
*loss of entry reports, maintenance requests and other paper work. 
*Hiding that a house is for sale until lease is signed,  even when asked.  
*Not turning up for inspections and then entering unexpectedly 2 days later. "
"Communication. Communication is very poor with property managers, also turnaround times. I am a tenant and a landlord. As a landlord I always get back to my property manager within 24 hours (usually within an hour) to ensure that my tenants are responded to quickly, whether that happens or not is another story."
"renting website- listing, bond lodge, tennancy forms etc all on one gov website."
Cannot think of anything at the moment - I am a property manager
That reported maintenance be attended to in a timely manner. 
"1. Be able to paint the walls and make myself at home. Since I cannot afford to buy a homer and may never be able to, I would like to at least feel comfortable in my rented home by being able to change more things to suit me. I would also like to be able to have pets without an owner telling me I cannot. There also should be a limit to the amount the owner can increase the rent by annually. My current estate agents increase the rent by a whopping 20% each year, just as a matter of standard. This is not acceptable."
"Being able to make my rental feel more like a home (like having pets, hanging pictures, etc.)"
"The qualifications held by PM, as a Property Manager myself (of 10 years) I do believe we require more training prior to obtaining our role and to improve the level of service to all our clients. Rents to be more managable. "
The owner needs to be able to have control over maintaining their asset within legislation 
"Bond refunds at end of lease. Ensure the onus is on the real estate to attend any dispute meetings if they wish to claim some of the bond, don't make the tenant have to attend (take time off work etc.) as they currently do. "
"Make tenants responsible for their actions, eg paying for rent and damages.
Everything is in the tenants favor."
Ability to make the house a home
Reduce price gouging by councils by charging more rates to investors that will in turn rise rental prices.
"We need better laws to protect the landloards investment property. Currently tenants are able to do pretty much anything and get away with it. 

Also, I would like laws placed on owners so that maintenance has to be done, carpets replaced ever X amount of years,Paint every X amount of years. "
Real estate agents seem to care very little and when something goes wrong on the property very rarely is action taken. 
maintenance being completed in a timely manner 
"Being a pet owner, I would like to see all rental properties accept pets."
I would never rent a property sight unseen. Reason - We moved to a unit complex on the Sunshine Coast from Cairns. We were not told at any time that there were another three blocks of hi-rise units being constructed or in the process of being commenced right next to and over the road from us hence we are moving again twelve months on.
"Property Managers need to be more detailed with condition reports and take more photos of the condition pre and post tenancy.
Property Managers need to undertake 6-12 monthly inspections and ensure the maintenance reported is carried out in a reasonable timeframe."
Abolishing termination without grounds to prevent retaliatory termination and put tenants in a stronger position to hold landlords accountable and enforce landlords' responsibilities without having to fear retaliation.
More balanced approach to tenant and rental property owners rights - current conditions favours the tenants.
Update the BCCM legislation and make property managers more accountable 
Make all landlords pay a 4-week bond that is held in the real estate's trust account for maintenance so no tradespeople go months without being paid from landlords.
More restrictions on Tenants re Damage to common property
Having the house professionally cleaned at both ends of the tenancy would prevent owners being able to handover houses filthy dirty while tenants are expected to return it clean.
"Making it easier to bring in a pet.
Alternatives to bond like trust bond which is powered by Terri scheer. Bond can be a significant amount of money and for people in dangerous situations (domestic violence etc) it can be almost impossible to raise that kind of cash quickly. Whilst bond offers owners a financial guarantee in case something happens, tenants are often left in terrible situations while they try to save money to afford bond plus 2-3 weeks of rent so that they’re always in front. "
"bond increases to properties - if you were to evict a tenant for un-paid rent and followed the correct processors the owner can be out of pocket for un-paid rent, court fees and maintenance to the property the bond would not cover this for units and standard houses.
Entry Notices - To be able to issue an Entry Notice to re-inspect repeated breaches within a 3 month basis.
Carpet cleaning/Pest Spray - under the act you cannot make tenants professionally clean carpets or professionally have a pest spray done in recent times we have found that tenants arent getting the carpets cleaned or are doing this themselves by hiring a machine and creating more damage as they arent a professional cleaner, this applies to the pest spray they are getting dangerous chemicals and arent professionals in this field of work. 
Tenants have the ability to make a rental a home items are available to be able to hang pictures etc with the hooks out on the market, majority of owners are reasonable with all requests from tenants"
"I am a Property Manager. Most things are very good, but the termination procedures in QCAT are heavily weighted toward tenants. Process is unwieldy, and long delays cause further losses to owners."
inspect the property more often
Better disclosure laws. More properties that are pet friendly. 
Screen tenants more thoroughly 
To have a fair system for all parties.
"As an owner, I am sometimes unable to take sensible decisions when tenants cause wilful damage.  It is rare for such damage, but it does happen."
Ensuring good property managers every time - managers that pay attention to the property and regular effective checks - and then communicate condition for benefit of owner and tenant.
3 day limit to return condition report. Not enough time
Helping landlords get better compensation for damage and easier access to recuperating rental arrears.
Number of weeks notice  that tenants are required to give of their intention to vacate
Central record of tenants and their history available immediately they apply 
provide more benefit and support to property owners
Allowed to hang pictures
"renters to show documents re pet health management i.e registration, microchip, vaccinations, flea & worm treatment, some form of obedience training"
"Place more responsibility on the tenant to maintain the property rented. Do not leave rubbish and possessions lying around the yard. Maintain the garden by mowing regularly. Do not damage anything eg 20 picture nails on one wall is too much. Clean stove, windows, cupboards as required. Clean cobwebs, Clean and repair properly all damage caused by pets."
Owner has more say about there property
Reduce rates premium paid by investors over and above owner occupiers
Having more rights when you have an exceptional renting track record. Real Estates have all the power and it is often quite a process to challenge them even when they are in the wrong. Often it is young inexperienced staff that are managing rental properties within the real estate industry and they lack experience and presume all tenants are bad tenants. I am tired of dealing with immature heavy handed 'one-size fits all' attitudes to tenants when there is not reason to presume a tenant is trying to do the wrong thing.
"Rental agents need to be more accountable. I have had bad experiences with tenants as a property owner e.g., not being told the truth and being charged for the same issue being fixed multiple times because the agents has forgotten the details/not written notes in the file.   There needs to be an easier process to complain about rental agents."
The application process and the limit of people on walk throughs
Harsher penalties for people who wreck tennants houses and thoese who don't pay their rent.  Easier to evict thoese that dont pay rent and don't look after your property
"Cost, Upkeep on the property, ridiculous inspection standards, inability to keep pets, having a family is seen as a disadvantage, dead rent money"
Honesty with real Estates
Better property management- communication between owners and tenants 
"Decreased rent cost, regulated by CPI rather than the real estate/landlord based on supply/demand and location. The ability to set the rent at one cost for two years, and making minor changes to the property."
Make it easier for pets to be allowed in rental houses
For landlords to have the same rights as tenants
"The court system is woeful. Create impartial adjudicators who are trained in tenancy legislation, preferably people who have had property management experience. Quite often adjudicators are ignorant of the legislation, make arbitrary decisions on the spot and are biased in favour of  tenants."
Make tenants pay for the damage the incur . One cost me $20K and on welfare so go nothing. 
"It should be compulsory that photos have to be attached to the entry condition reports. Too many times real estate agents have accused and forced tenants to pay for damage that they have not done.

Tenants should not have to clean carpets or complete pest controls during a tenancies. "
get real estates to fix everything either broken or needs fixing with in a certain time
The ability to hold tenants and property managers responsible damage and failure to adequately inspect 
shorten the time to move a bad tenant out of you premises
Better communication with property manager
Balance for both parties and the courts to know the rules 
Not discriminating based on pet ownership. 
"Equal playing field between landlords and tenants, specifically in terms of notification periods for Periodic Tenancies.  Suggestion is 30 Days & 30 Days."
The laws seem to protect the tenants more than the landlords. We had one tenant last year who left the premises without having paid rent for several weeks. It took quite some time completing all the necessary paperwork to resolve this issue. It was clear that the tenant had vacated the property. It became apparent to us that the tenancy laws place the landlords at a disadvantage. The issue was eventually resolved and the full bond was returned to us but the unit was left vacant for some time before there was agreement with the RTA that we could re-rent the unit. We lost more money in rentals than what was recuperated. It seems that the government wishes landlords to assume all responsibility for the rental market. This attitude and lack of support at government level is discouraging us from continuing as landlords. Tenants are fully aware of their rights these days and use these to their fullest advantage. 
Allowing pets and longer tenancy agreements 
"Expectations of property managers when vacating. Unreasonable special conditions as part of lease, eg. Cleaning floor tile grout, steaming carpets, cleaning blinds, spraying for fleas and ticks"

Fairer legislation for property owners.
Only 6month inspection on 12 month leases 
"A requirement to test and protect tenants from the effects of lead paint in properties over a certain age.

Increased notice for entry. 7 days is not sufficient when you are a working professional with business commitments and children who have school and school holiday commitments. It should be a mutually agreed date within one month of the request.

Agents should not be allowed to enter a property without the tenant's written agreement, unless there is more than a one month period in which the tenant is unable or unwilling to be present at an inspection. I have had agents who have invaded my privacy, looking through personal drawers etc, when I was not present because I had rescheduled the inspection for a time when I could be there. They entered at the first appointed time anyway. There was nothing I could do because they were legally allowed to enter for an inspection, due to the fact there was an initial inspection notice. Due to the Act's protecting their right to enter with 7 days notice, the mutually agreed rescheduling of the inspection did not protect me from their unexpected and unagreed to entry when I was not present and was not aware they were entering as I had been mislead into understanding we had rescheduled.

The agents must be bound by the most recent notice, or the  mutually agreed on date.

Right to keep pets, same as Victoria.

Change... more CREATE more NRAS properties

Better communication from Real Estate.
Stronger rules to take better care of property
Approve pet ownership in exchange for having to pay for damages caused by pet.
Better protection for owners.
Give more power to the landlord. Its is their investment
"I want aircon to be considered essential and have to be repaired and maintained by the owner. It's mandatory to have heaters repaired and running, but not aircons. We live in Cairns... It's ridiculous "
"Renting has become all about the tenants needs and less about the owners needs.  This needs to change.  If a tenant wants all of the control, they can purchase their own house.  Until then, if they wish to make any changes whatsoever to a rented property or take a pet, they simply must get permission to do so."
As a tenant I would like more say on when the real estate wishes to enter. While plenty of notice is given I have no say on whether this is a convenient time or date.
"The exit condition report is useless. Most tenants don't complete 
Better to discuss with tenant after Bond inspection"
Not build a rental property in Queensland

Owners too strict. Real estates/owners too harsh when leaving and keep bond 
Reduce liability for landlord
Protection for owners when tenants default on payment
"Renters should pay for water and rates as they do in UK. 
Tenants must treat the dwelling as a home not a hotel - not cleaning anything that requires standing on a ladder?! This equates to owners having to come over and change a light bulb!"
QCAT for disputes takes too long to have the hearing
Less inspections after more than a year or 2 of living at the residence & you have passed all inspections.
Definatley the price and the lengthy terms and conditions to be more clear.

Better treatment from real estate agents
More background info in relation to tenants 
Bond to be able to be transferred between properties. 
Hold the rental property owner more accountable for needed repairs
"Tenants can get black listed for their behaviours. There should also be a list regarding shoddy landlords. I searched and found three previous tenants from the same property we had rented, and they all got screwed over by a dodgy greedy landlord. She charged the 4 of us for repairs for the exact same “damage” she said that we had all caused. None of us were actually at fault. "
Real estate agents need to be fairer when doing exit inspections. Do them quickly after an exit and be less exacting and more understanding of exactly what fair wear and tear includes. Also to be more inclined to allow pets. 
Legislation is geared towards the owner. Reform needed to improve tenant rights and attitudes towards them. Mediation options are flawed and seem geared towards lessors  even when there reasonable repairs required.
"As a rental property owner receiving less than the bank rate on the value of the property i feel as though the govt thinks i am some how making a fortune out of the property and can just continue to pay for every new change , not be able to deduct real cost I incur and loose rights in regard to how my property is looked after.
"
Very happy where we are no need for change
Be allowed to paint your place to make it more homely! 
The ability to have your home inspected at such short notice and for vague reasons. 
Less arbitrary reasons for denying bond refunds. For the RTA to be on the renter's side. For pets to be allowed everywhere. For regular maintenance of properties when needed/asked
Maintaining  when tear and wear and keeping affordable.
ability to not allow huge increase in rent at renewal e.g. $50+
More choice over ending and when to end contract. 
Equal time frames for owners and tenants to end a period of tenancy.
Increase the bond to cover damages at the end of the lease
If you have rented your property for more than 12 months paid your rent on time and take care of the property inspections should not be every 3 months and a tenant should have to be there. We always ensure there is someone home when inspections are done (if you own your property you would not let someone come into your home when no one is there) also 6 monthly at least would be better. We pay on time and take care of the property and have done for over 2 years it would be nice to be rewarded for doing the right thing.
Maintenance issues being resolved promptly.
"Arbitrary application of renting laws by real estate agents and the seemingly powerlessness, or reluctance, of the RTA to intervene."

"Supported tenancies, intervention in hostile neighbour situations for social housing. "
Renters should not be permitted to stay on in a property once the lease has expired.
Nothing.  My Property Managers have been superb.
Being able to transfer bond to different property with the same realestate without having to complete the initial process from the start.
"Permission to make minor modifications to a property (as long as they are reversible, eg hanging heavy frames, removing ugly curtains). Owners should be forced to consider requests for improving the property (eg install air conditioning) and provide the option to tenants to pay more rent if necessary."
for tenants to be responsible and return the house to the condition that was let to them at the beginning of the Tenancy I;e picture screws.  Definitely no pets inside
better tenant screening
Have a sliding scale for notice to quit for both tenant & landlord. So the longer you have rented the more notice needs to be given. 
Being knocked back for houses through real estates because we have pets.
Noy being rejected because I have children and or pets.
"When renting in a duplex, do not allow smokers to rent if a nonsmoker lives next door. Very disgusting and you have to keep doors and windows shut all the time, even in summer. Allow pets and wall hangings!"
Cheaper rent for rentals that are older in age or long term tenants 
Tenants who apply for properties that they can actually afford
"1. Legislate that property owners have the right to refuse to accept tenants that smoke cigarettes, or have pets. As long as property owners disclose conditions of tenancy to prospective tenants, then there is rarely any legitimate argument to be entertained. 

The desire to smoke cigarettes, or have pets in someone else's property while renting is at the sole discretion of the property owner.

2. Given that there is a high turnover of property managers within agencies, legislate that they must keep accurate information on each property, and provide appropriate information handover and skills training to each newly hired/promoted property manager."
Improve the public housin situation.  More housing for women. More housing for the homeless. 
Better definition of fair wear and tear - it is always contentious of what is reasonable and usually comes down to the attitude of the inspecting agent.
"Get rid of the 2 months to leave if they call give 2 weeks to leave it should be the same . if i take a bad tenant to court and win they should have only a set time to pay me back of it goes to spurs or if i claim on my insurance they should give me the amount the judge awards me and the same thing applies ,eg  they owe me $900  that pay me back $25 to $50 a week  or a set time or it goes to ''SPURS'' not that  i have to take it to court over and over waisting my ,, ""TIME "" if you steal something from a shop up go to court pay the fine go to jail or the fine goes to spurs ,,,,,.simple"
That if the facilities within a property get broken or stop working etc. that the landlord pays to fix the issue back to its original state within a timely manner.
"As an owner tenants have to have a standard to which they can live in a property, and stick to the rules,   they cannot store drugs in your ceiling, and tenants cannot use their bond to pay the last 4 weeks of rent as then if the house is left dirty and destroyed the owner is left with the bill as most landlord insurances have large excesses and they have every excuse why they shouldn't have to pay."
We could use one more room 
The way agents speak to tenants and how easily they get away with false claims
"Shorter notice periods for giving breaches to tenants & shorter time periods for tenants to remedy breaches. Because of the time allowed at present, most of the bond can be consumed during the breach notice & time to remedy periods."
Tougher penalties/legislation in relation to illegal entry to rental properties. 
Tenants need more rights.
Follow USA in long term/fixed price rentals
"Stop the forced signing of a new lease every six months.
Nothing wrong with an intinial six months turm, but the continued locking in is unfair on the renter"
"The right for tenants to make minor cosmetic changes to a property. The right for tenants to own pets, these two conditions that are factored into almost all lease agreements are an egregious breach of tenants rights and negatively effect the quality of life of renters. The "

"Change the amount of times of Rental inspection

Pets"
"The high cost, no pets, more rental stock. Release more land!!!"
Making sure that the references are followed up proply
We've recently become pet owners and the pressure of finding a pet friendly rental without having to pay a triple bond on the Sunshine Coast would be a great help. And longer leases to provide security for families with pets.
Better laws in place to help safe guard the owner of their investment properties against the people that have no respect for homes and people that own them. 
"Real Estate Agencies. 3 Monthly inspections. We have lived in our current rental for over two years without issue. But 3 monthly inspections start to become intrusive, after a coue of years of being in one property. 6 monthly inspections would be less intrusive,  especially when the tenant has never failed an inspection. "
Landlord and agents being held accountable for repairs. As a tennent you feel insecure to complain with a family needing a roof over their heads. 
Less fear of retaliation when standing up for your right as a tenant. Although the agent can't evict you they can still behave unprofessional and hostile towards you making the remaining term of your tenancy difficult. The way agents 'talk down' to tenants and have a sense of entitlement over them.
Being able to put pictures photos  etc on walls to make it feel like my home 
Make the house feel more like your home without being watched and monitored all the time 
The lack of response from real estate agents on repairs and maintenance
"Property Managers have too much power, just because you rent you are treated like a second class citizen"
When tenants get into arrears. 21 days far to long to begin proceedings to collect rent as the banks don't allow for any payment issues.
Being Allowed pets and to put things up on the walls so the house feels more homely.
The idea of being allowed to have pets on the property state wide regardless 
For Real Estate agents to be more accountable to repair requests.
"Being able to have pets. 

Real estate that tells you thinks promptly. "
Give tenants the right to own a companion pet by allow for tenants to have one animal without requiring approval from the owner (unless other wise stated in the tenancy ie strata property). Any additional animals would require landlord approval. 
Response time and attitude of owners to maintenance issues that affect the agreed condition of the property. Also RTA are nothing but toothless tigers. Random and unreasonable rent rises.
Give landlords more rights
Direct channel to owner instaed of property management for suggestions/improvements
The ability for landlords to claim your bond without preemptive contest. The limited options for renting with pets. That you have to live completely perfectly without a single scuff on the wall. That repairs take extended periods of time leading to costs at the renters expense without recompense.
Less intrusive inspections every 12 weeks 
I am lucky I have a really great owner and real estate. 
"I'm on a low single income and the fear of the rent going up or finding another place to stay that I can afford and still have money to put petrol in the car to get to work and food on the table has me concerned. I also have a small dog and have been told in the past that if I get rid of the dog I can rent a house. He's now 11 years old and the only family I have.

"
Owners forcing tenants to renew long term leases after the initial period. 
Less routine inspections
Stable Property Manager
More availability of available houses that allow pets
Information given to tenants is at times incorrect as the consultant is not given all of the information by the tenant.  More needs to be done to ensure that what the tenants are asking or reporting is 100% correct
At the moment the law favours property owners and property managers leaving the tenant with no where to go when property managers threaten or intimidate them. The RTA is usually unhelpful and generally just cite the current law back to the tenant. Even the website puts you on a loop where stock standard answers are given with no real feedback or help.
Longer leases for greater security. 
More rights for renters and more accountability on property managers and owners to keep the property at a safe and acceptable standard.
You could chose the method in which you would like to pay rent (i.e. not forced to use payments systems that have surcharge fees)
Real estates being jerks. 
more flexibility for the tenant to change the renting period 
"How to check tenant history, references, finance checking. 
Really difficult to find good tenants"
Need 6 weeks bond as bond does not cover the time it takes to get a bad tenant out of the property
Improve communications with potential tenant groups to identify long term renters
Better maintenance and not having to pay for water. Not getting an increase in rent every year! We can barely afford to live as it is
A better selection process and opening to view places would be a more personal way to go about renting.
"As a landlord, I want tenants to treat the property with respect and if there is damage done to the property, the cost doesn't fall back on the landlord, I think some people think, ""so what they can afford it""  Also, when a pre-entry inspection is completed, why is there so much controversory with the exit inspection (general wear and tear seems to be the escape route in a lot of my experiences)"
"More rights for renters! Let us know exactly what others are paying for in our surrounding neighborhoods and even in our same apartments! It should be illegal to charge more for the same apartment. Also, more consideration when moving out and getting your bond back. it is IMPOSSIBLE to leave everything perfect when you've lived there! There are always signs of living but real state agents see it as a way to get money and the owners as a cheap way to get free renovations! Renting has become a sales and a way for owners to squeeze the most money out of tenants! As a young professional wanting to live near work (CBD) I have no other option but to rent because we can't afford a house!"
Owner having more to say about his/her property
'- Make it easier for young people to leave the renting system when wanting to buy or move.
6 monthly inspections - not every three months like I am a criminal
To stop worrying that if you are forced into complaining to the RTA for repairs etc to be done your agent or owner won't then create issues against you!
"Less frequent rent increases

More legal protection for Landlords
Financial assistance in maintaining gardens. For eg mulch or assistance in plant purchase
More reasonable rental agents
Easier approval for pets (dogs) but also other animals 
We need More dog friendly houses. Where owner will allow pets to sleep inside
"Need to remove tenants immediately in cases of damage and/or non-payment. Current rules mean months of extra damage while no rent is being paid. Tenants should be able to be removed by the time the bond is used up, at least. "
More rights for landlords - at the moment the tenants hold all the rights.
complex paperwork and long time periods on claims and hearings
Allow tenants to submit long term lease application and regulations on how much tradies can charge 
More legal advocates for renters
tenants are allowed to have a pet such as a caged bird
Longer term standard leases - more like commercial leases offer 3 years with option period and defined rent review processes.
Tenants can not pay the rent and by the time you get them out the bond does not cover what they owe.  There should be a bond for damages and a bond for non payment of rent.  If they do not pay the rent we should be able to access the bond immediately and when the bond is gone they should have to move out immediately.  
Real estates are very difficult and challenging to work with. They are invasive and can be patronising at times. 
"That the agents are grateful we have supported the home owner and taken a lease. All is in the favour of the agent, its not a equal agreement."
More pet friendly options
"The agent being a bully, you have no say or the agent will give you a bad report, teh agent can do whatever they like and teh tenant really has no say but to do whatever is requested, teh agents claiming out of bond things that cannot be claimed"
"Lower rental prices, its so difficult to find a place under $300 now. If the price for living is going up, salaries need to as well."
Scope for landlords to remove bad tenants.
Shifting the balance of power closer to the centre between renters and landlords to improve rental security and increase rental demand.
"Better access to the owner of a property when the agent is not suitably representing the owner's interests.

Improved minimum standard for entry and exit condition report photos and detailing."
Reduce cost to allow single renters to enter the property market
"More accountability for real estate agents. Once you are a tenant, you are no longer a priority. This includes general enquiries, maintenance etc. "
Have access to long-term (2+ year) leases. It is hard to be settled in a home when that home can be taken from you at almost any time.
More freedom for long term renters to make approved alterations to properties - i.e painting etc
More incentives for owners to improve the property. 
Rethink tenants having pets
"Pricing. Some places are ridiculously expensive, making it near-impossible to find a place in a decent area, especially for students and those on Centrelink payments."
Periodic leases being more easily available and break leases easier to navigate with less costs associated.
"Make owners of rental homes pay a bond that property managers can access to fix defects in rental properties. Tenants,should not have to resort to breach notices to get  issues fixed."
Rent and extra fees for water etc
Having the real estate doing their job professional.
The ability to sign a long term lease (greater than the existing 6 or 12 months).
Hold landlords accountable for sub standard living in poorer areas.
Pets allowed in all places 
"I currently work as a property manager and I feel that bond amounts should be increased from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, I manage a lot of properties under the $200p/w week mark and by the time the tenant is breached and notice to leave is issued loss of approximately  2 weeks rent already and a lot of the time tenant walks out doesn't attend only leaving $400 for bond clean and payment of any damages caused which is not enough and then owner has to pay for this themselves to re-let the property. I also believe that tenants should engage their choice of professional carpet cleaner to clean carpets to prevent damage caused by tenants no using carpet cleaning machines correctly and causing potential further damage to carpets, I also believe tenants should engage a professional to attend to a flea spray for the property upon vacating if they have had a pet living at the property."
Agents sending a cleaner in at the end of lease if it’s not up to their standard and the cleaner charging whatever they like and then it comes out of the tenant’s bond. The tenant and the agent should be mutually agreeable on the cleaner’s quote and mutually satisfied that the job was actually completed. 
No cat policy everywhere.
Rude real estate agents who insist they can and will use their keys to enter my home when I'm not home.
The weight of responsibility. If the owners put cheap fixtures/grass. the cost is too much for the renter
The ability to request certain maintenance needs such as carpet replacement or painting... many units and homes require it and owners do little or nothing to update them
"If market conditions change, and median rental rates fall in my area, I want to benefit from that by getting a DECREASE in my rent on the next lease I sign, at the same premises.  I should not be forced to move to match the market."
Cap rent rises.
The ability of a landlord to provide 3 months notice to vacate a property even if a lease agreement has been signed
Allowing pets in rentals as we have a special needs child who would benefit from one.
More places for pets to be allowed. Less discrimination against low income. Less discrimination against having children. 
"More needs to be done to screen the people that want to rent a property, so landlords are not left footing the bill for damage to property. Property Managers need to be above the age of 25 to fully understand the term ""Property Inspection"", because lets face it, what young adult seriously knows what ""CLEAN"" actually is? We also need a tighter control of the Real Estate industry, we seem to have Agents popping up everywhere just to make a quick buck in this Expensive Housing Market."
"As a tenant, whether we are wonderful tenants or not, we have absolutely no rights when the landlord makes a decision. "
The avalibility of getting rentals they are very limited with 30-40 people looking at one rental

Faults with the property (i.e. previous flooding) should be made explicit to tenants before signing the lease.  "
"Less restrictions and stipulations surrounding pets, more pressure on rental owners to fix issues when they arise"
make it easier to have pets and more real estates agents who are actually aware of the tenancy laws in QLD
Bond issue - real estate agents take whatever bond amount they possibly can - caught 3 different real estates trying to create fake invoices for cleaning etc.
To be treated like a human being by real estate agents and owners.
Property managers/owners being better monitored in cases of emergency repairs such as electricity not being fixed for months after moving in to a new rental.
Sometimes the agent or the house owner charges the tenant an unreasonable amount at the end of the tenancy to take in to account the genaral wear and tear.
Allowing pets in all properties to give much better options and choices. 
Tenants rights protected more - currently the only recourse available to a dispute is to end a tenancy.  NSW Fair Trade offers clear guidelines and outcomes for tenants in those areas which can come into disputed.
reduce the price of renting.
Maintenance on houses to be kept up to date and on time
"It would be great if six months and 12 months lease terms are replaced with more extended periods, such as 3 and 5 years with the inclusion of 6 months probation. "
"Privacy - I feel that I am a good tenant, my bills are always paid on time yet we are still forced to have inspections multiple times a year. "
More flexibility. We live in these houses calling them our homes but have property managers and owners hassling us for inspections or to not do silly little things you usually wouldn’t think about living in your own home. Also being able to have a say in hanging photos or little changes that can easily be fixed up when moving out. Pets is also an issue where it makes it really hard to get a place suitable or even be accepted for these places. 
Pets should be allowed in more places. 
Legislation to protect the landlord rather than all for the tenant
Improved living conditions. 
Be able to personalize your home to a certain degree
I'd want a way to communicate with the owner as my rental agency is often slow.
Realistic price of weekly rent for places 
"Higher penalties for people who litter (etc) on adjoining balconies i.e. ground level. My experience is on ground level apartments and other renters litter a lot which takes away from the enjoyment.

Smoking -- to be banned all together -- even on balconies.

Pets allowed (most pets are well trained and people clean up after them thoroughly, so a bond would not be right it would penalise those who do the right thing -- perhaps those with bad rental records etc can have these bonds imposed rather than to penalise the 'good' guys)."
"More transparency - more options to pay where we aren’t stuck with extra fees all the time. Nsw has banned these systems why hasn’t qld?
More actual rights for long term tenants- it’s not a rental it’s a home!"
More information when screening potential renters. 
The owner of our property doesn’t respect our privacy
Greater safety for owners against bad tenants.
"for people on the pension, a easy to learn how to use the system."
"Prices are too high, automatic rent increases do not match market values or interest rates and there is NEVER a reduction in rent to match market conditions; agents and landlords are disinterested in their tenants and do not effect necessary repairs in a timely manner."
A tenancy advocacy group in a central Brisbane location that actually has staff numbers to handle the enquires from tenants seeking advice/ assistance that ACTUALLY has real world value to take on Agents and owners who treat us like a cash cow.  
Making lease changes easier
Live in a place that wasn’t to expensive 
"Frequency of inspections, and drastic yearly increases in rent"
Rent in Queensland is becoming oppressively expensive....cheaper available housing would be a huge plus.
"Training, experience, knowledge and overarching body of Real Estates and Agents. Many agents lack any basic understanding of the legislation and rules relating to renting in QLD. The number we have dealt with lack communication skills. "
Fixed term contract after a certain period of renting (1 year?)
Attitudes of property managers and owners
Better conditions for tenants: fixed term rentals that you never know whether they will be renewed or not till a few months before it is due create an extremely uncomfortable situation for tenants wishing for a stable life.
The ability to sign lease of more than one tear at a time
"Landlord/Agency responsibility to maintain the rental properties efficiently. Lack of care when something is not working or broken is appalling, it takes months of hassling them to get things actioned. They treat tenants as second rate citizens."
Removing the fear of having to give up an animal if you are to move from rental to rental. 
"Lower rent prices, able to hang paintings on walls, able to use blu tac on the walls"
I’d like to be able to have a pet.
"More transparency about what can be deemed an issue for either the tenant or the property owner. I.e. Tenants to know what they can and can't do or get the owner to fix. At the same time, you hear horror stories about tenants trashing places or not paying rent, yet owners are powerless to have them evicted. More needs to be done to protect owners as well in such situations."
"The real estate rentals should have more interaction with the owners. Some of the places I have viewed, you wouldn't put your dog in!"
"Equal rights for tenants and Agents, ie if a tenant can lodge a bond refund prior to vacating the property, the Agent should have that same opportunity especially if there is know damage at the property"
To be able to put things on the wall.
the way property managers actually get things fixed when needed and communicate properly with their tenants
Better property Managers - to strict 
Ensure property managers/owners actually understand their roles and responsibilities under the Act - and be held accountable for failing in their duties.
"The rental property manager to inspect property immediately before tenancy to ensure everything is functional not just tick the boxes on the RTA entry form.  Then within the first week is anything is wrong the rental manager needs to take responsability for their staff and correct the problem at their cost.  This includes pre-cleaning for extended vacancies, light checking, taps not leaking and functional etc."
Better long term maintenance e.g. Painting the inside of the property replacing flooring (carpet/Lino) after so many years suggest 8 -10 years. 
"Have just had to break the lease to get out of highly unsatisfactory experience in a complex of 8 units. Different agents managed different units. Body corporate did not maintain grounds and did not respond to questions re why some units had on their lease to be able to park on the common property. Poor communication and no rights and experienced bullying from neighbours, car vandalism etc. "
Hassle of rental application and waiting. 
"More Government and no profit Organization, build rental properties for over 60 ties and pensioners !
This will lead to lower the privat rent prices."
"Having the ability to talk to owners on a more personal level, even via an online chat room that would allow anonymity of phone numbers/personal details. "
Take away the restrictions requiring owner approval for pets at the property. 
Make rent cheaper
Controlled prices regardless of location. Professional Property Managers.  Landlords held accountable to condition of property.  A group should be set up to audit rental properties and property management.
"A better bond system in place, why not a simple transfer, you have to save up every time you move "
"I'd change how Real Estates and Property Owners advertise lease pricing. 

I inspected a house for lease/rent which was advertised for $300 p/w. On the day of inspection there was about 10 groups who also inspected the same property. 24hrs after inspecting the property and submitting my application form, the Real Estate rang me to advise that the advertised lease/rent had gone up $80 because of the response to rental inspection. This was the decision of the Property Owner.

This is unethical and immoral, and as far as I'm concerned, illegal. When a property is advertised for a set price, it should be illegal for the Real Estate & Property Owner to bump the price up based on interest. 

This should NEVER happen. The Real Estate and Property Owner should be fined, and the price should remain what is advertised. "
The amount of paperwork required should reduce.
"Real estate agents usually aren't great mediators between rental property owners and tenants, so I'd really like some kind of medium that I could contact when I have a problem with neighbours or the internet, etc, and actually be taken seriously. "
"Entry reports being completed by Property Managers and owners more accurately. Always indicated everything is clean and undamaged. Not the case and most of the property requires cleaning. If anything is missed on the entry report by the tenant then at the end of the tenancy the Real Estate take bond even though the property is usually in better condition than when the tenant moves in. More understanding when performing routine inspections the property is live in. Eg: Noting on the routine inspection report dusting of a fan is required when the rest of the property is in clean, tidy and undamaged condition."
"Cheaper rent. I pay more per week for someone else's mortgage than their mortgage costs them, but I can't save enough to get a house deposit together.
I'd also like to see subsidies for landlords to install solar. Electricity costs are ridiculous, and there's nothing the tenant can do to mitigate the cost."
faster response to things that need fixing and more updates on when they will be fixed etc. 
"The owner controls the 65% electricity bill we pay.
We are unable to change this to pay only 50% of the bill
Our previous bills were cheaper? by  $100 per qtr"
Landlords need to do repairs on house
"My current property manager does not respond to maintenance requests, says they will be completed but never are"
Less rental increases.
Streamline approval process for renting applications. 
The power landlords have over their tenants. They use intimidation and threats frequently and we are very nervous about moving out. Tenants have no power.
Longer lease agreements
"If it is clear that you keep the property well, then stop the 3 monthly inspections, it's just a means of billing the owner for unnecessary visits and for tenants like me, a reminder this is a house and not a home, no matter how much you try to make it a home. "
"I believe pets (1) should automatically be accepted, with tentats signing a declaration that if any damages are made by that pet they are responsible for repairs before exiting the lease. Pet just be registered and microchipped. This will help with the amount of animals we have in pounds due to people having to choose their pet or a roof over their head."
Peace of mind that dogs (and humans) with a good rental history won't be discriminated against.  
Things being fixed before you enter the home.
Rental agencies should be scrutinized more. They gouge too much from landlords. They don't do a good job managing rentals.
Ability to sign longer tenancy agreements
"Less grey areas with things like who cleans gutters, or who pays for install of NBN"
a landlord should be obliged to provide exit report.
The ability to have timely maintenance and repairs to the dwelling. 
More rights and clarity regarding these for renters when the owner is selling the property 
Make it easier to have a dog.
"More clarification around damage to property. Wear and tear is not acceptable, because if they are moving and furniture and damage the wall, that's deemed as ware and tear, but it's not. It's negligence. if it was their own home they would get it fixed, but they don't tell you and hope you don't notice. Any damage should be paid for."
That the pictures and information provided by real estate agents matches the reality and that they make the times that rentals are available to be viewed to times that actually benefit working people (the exact people they insist on having pay their rents)
RTA to make decisions instead of going to QCAT
I would prefer to take on longer leases than just one year. If the tenant has a good history with the owner. And both are agreeable to a two - 5- 10  year lease why is it not allowed?
"Greater rights for owners.  Especially when it comes to protecting your property, we should be able to evict tenants who are causing harm to our property sooner and easier than what is currently allowed.  
Processes through QCAT take too long and owners are out of pocket for damages that tenants cause in the interim."
More communication between tenant-manager-owner in order to ensure tenant is feeling safe and everything is working as they should .
Ability to put up pictures. Have animals. No photos taken during inspections. Improved conditions leaving rental eg agents taking copious amounts of money out of bond for cleaning and repairs that were not a priority during inspections. 
"Transparency from agents, in particular accurate photos of properties and specific allowances for pets."
"Pets approvals easier to get, and more security for the renter regarding bond clean and bond refund. We tend to get ripped off most places no matter how well we look after a place and clean and report any damage as it arises. "
Longer leases and ability to negotiate on rent. 
"Even the balance, and ensure QCAT deals with matters on a level playing field throughout the state. "
"More strict guidelines
Clearer legislation"
"More benefits for long term tenants
Including cheaper rent, hanging picture's, minor renovations"
"Cheaper rent. We want a property that is pet friendly and not expensive. It doesn't matter if the house is newly renovated or painted, we just want something affordable and homey, not nice and stressful."
Ease of accessing bond returns. What happens when tenants refuse to move out at end of lease
Bit more privacy as I rent a unit where the owner uses the other unit from Thursday or fridays till Monday or Tuesday most  weekends and on holidays 
 A bit more flexibility in what you can and can't do in your rental property.  Also some of the real estates are just horrible.
Clearer guide lines on all things such as wear and tear. 
"Not having mandatory house inspections every 3 months would be great, seems we've rented the same house for a decade. "
"Tenure security. Now, I can be thrown out anytime the landlord wishes. The end of contract should not be the end of tenure security. At the very minimum, tenants should be allowed to sign long-term contracts (10-20 years or more) with rent prices locked in (and adjusted annually according to the CPI or similar index). "
"longterm rental contracts, or even better the German model: once you sign a rental agreement you can stay as long as you pay rent on time and the owner does not claim to live in property themselves."
Agents should have to prove they have given the owner all information about repairs and maintenance needed. Owners should be forced to fix problems in set time limits.
Longer term leases to avoid yearly rent increases. Eg 2-5 year leases. Gives tenants a bit off stability and owners regular longterm tenants.
If rental home is being looked after inspections changed to yearly not every 3 months
"Less scrutiny by property managers, accept fair wear and tear without an argument. "
The agent behaves very bad about the RTA bond refunds. They want to make money from cleaning stuff.
"Implementing a time requirement, for example two weeks, for maintenance problems to be dealt with by property managers/owners. "
"Make property investment as a business rather than a passive investment - this will bring competition, more investment and professionalism in the sector. 

Rent payers will become customers and rental property portfolio will be valued based on their long term good tenants rather than on property value - similar to commercial tenancies."
"Urgent concerns to be done through Police, not thru court, for Rural/Regional areas."
I would like to be able to put photos on the wall 
Allowed pets allowed to make minor changes less inspections more maintenance done
"I would like greater transparency from owners when they refuse a request of a tenant to undertake something within the rental property - such as a small pet, putting up photos on the wall etc. Often the request is coordinated via the rental agent and the response from the owner is ""yes"" or ""no"" with no reasoning as to why.

If we were able to understand the reasons for a decision I think it would make it easier to accept, or open the doors to a negotiation and lead to greater satisfaction for the tenant - otherwise resentment can build, the tenant will leave and the owner can loose otherwise good tenants. "
More realistic rental bond amounts - 4 weeks rent is ridiculous when you consider the value of properties & damage that can be done by tenants.
I would love to make it easier to find pet friendly rentals. 
"Only being given a 6 month lease each time despite me having rented the place for 4years now. Constant people entering my home, access (keys) to my house given to contractors even though I stipulate I don't want them there without the real estate or myself present. The sheer number of people that have to enter to do the smoke alarm check, the inspection after signing the 6 month lease and then half way through the lease and then again after signing the next lease. The contractors coming in to do the smoke alarm test several times a year and other contractors because things break down. Nothing is fixed in a reasonable timeframe. As a single Mum, I pay quite expensive rent and pay this to have air conditioning because of the heat in brisbane. When anything breaks down, it is 4-6 weeks before someone comes out to fix it. They refuse to do any work quickly. They use cheap labor and the work is shoddy and breaks down again. This has occurred on the air conditioner over summer for 6 months.. the dishwasher is the same. I now fix things myself so it's done straight away. I follow all the rules and can't have any pictures on walls and have to have absolutely everything that touches the floor, with padding. There are no fly screens on the windows so I have to have the house constantly locked up and they won't pay to put screens on. When the owner wants to do some work on the house, they expect me to just let all of the contractors come whenever they want and use a clause stating it's emergency repairs when it's not. "
Not needing approval to have pets
Ability to hang pictures and put shelf up in laundry 
"Be able to make it feel more like a home
ie be able to hang picture "
Real estate agents and property managers that respect the person paying for the dwelling....the renter not tenant . The word tenant evokes serfdom landlord mentality from 10th century England. The renter pays the rent. therefore he is a commercial customer
"Owners need to be able to have their say in the property they own. When tenants wish to set up a business to operate from the property, ask for approval with all pets, and no changes to the property without the owners consent within reason."
"The cost of renting is quite high at present, and being on a pension makes it a bit more difficult."
Being able to hand up pictures etc
Longer leases should be available
"Change to the rules regarding allowing pets, and some mandatory standard amenities  (such as air con, or at least ceiling fans in all areas) for rentals at certain price points - especially given that we live in QLD! We are a sub-tropical state! "
The interaction with the real estate companies and the price in rent
"For tenants who have a good record with keeping a house in great condition with no damage cause, less frequent 'Routine Inspections' would be great. Maybe 6 monthly instead of every 3 months. 

When there is a maintenance issue with a property, Tenants should not be treated as though they are being a nuisance. Although some tenants can set a bad example for all, there are many tenants that cause no issues with properties & we all get a bad name as a result. "
response times for real estate agents to attend to breakdowns
"Rights to ensure mail is not stoped or blocked, i am unable to get boxes sent to my address everyone should be able to get packages sent to there house with out having building management block or stop it, also different experience depending on if you rent via them direct or not.. ie, if i rented though the building management, i could get my mail with out issue."
Assurance that the property is protected against Tenants not doing the right by Landlord and cleaning property to original rented state.
All rentals can have pets but any demages done by the put is to be fixed by tenet
"Cheaper prices, more flexibility in paying rent, flexibility for pets"
"When the Agent does an inspection, not to make note of how certain things are not clean- its an inspection for damages, not hotel cleanliness. An also automatically abolish fixed term tenancy agreements after the first 12 months and automatically goes in to a periodic. Extinguish the myths between periodic and fixed term tenancy agreements."
The notice periods are very unbalanced in this unfair market. The penalties for tenants absconding is non existent. 
improved maintenance and standards of house maintenance.  recognition of wear and tear especially on exit conditions.   Not leaving excessive error reporting for exit of houses that have never been mentioned in routine house inspections during the tenancy 
Having the ability to hang pictures.
Cheaper rent and more availability 
Allow tenants to make minor modifications to the dwelling for example hooks for hanging photos on walls without seeking landlord approval.
Improve the tenant's right to refuse entry and protection of tenant's privacy/confidential information. 
Landlords & Property Managers need to be given more rights and opportunity to seek rent payments from tenants. Tenants receiving Centrelink payments & Rent Assistance should have their rent payments deducted as a mandatory payment to Landlord or Real Estate
Able to have pets with a good reference and able to hang pictures without damage to the walls.
i think things are fair
Ability to access rent assistance even if you don’t have children. 
"Visibility to property management formal complaints and complaint management records.  
Some rental management groups are more difficult to work with and this is not something known other than through social media. I dislike social media as a tool for reviewing businesses as reviews are normally left by highly disgruntled individuals who did not follow correct or legal channels to overcome issues - therefore not a true reflection of formal complaints raised against a business and the outcomes. As a tenant, or landlord, I have not been able to locate a transparent method for comparing property management groups for best practice."
Everything needs to work and if it breaks it needs to be replaced
There are not enough rental properties for those with low income.  The difficulty of finding a pet friendly rental also makes life difficult for many.
"Less intrusions into the home i.e inspections, when you have a perfect history regarding keeping the property in excellent condition inspections should reduce in frequency. "
"Greater recognition of rights of renters (repairs done in a timely manner, reasonable expectations regarding wear and tear during tenancy etc) "
"Everything. The customer service is always terrible. Twice the agents have come in for inspections and firstly lost an entire set of keys, secondly they let my sick kitten escape after I left several instructions to keep him inside. 

We have problems with our neighbour below who smokes weed and blasts music constantly and they will not help us. They say it's a police matter, the police say it's a tenancy matter."
"We rent a unit in an complex occupied by holiday makers, owner occupiers and long term tenants.
Our rent was increased just prior to works starting on the pool and painting of the whole of the outside of the buildings and fence.  We are disrupted by the water being turned off and scaffolding and workers being around the complex.
We were never advised by the property managers of this work being conducted.
As an investment property owner myself, I would not increase the rent until after the work had been completed, due to the inconvenience and any benefits come after the work is completed (only visual on the outside in our case)
We have also requested minor maintenance issues be attended to, without success."
Be able to hang pictures without permission
"I would like the premises to be in the condition that was promised when negotiating the lease.  I have entered into leases with three (3) properties over the past 4 years and all of them have had faults that I have picked up during the initial inspection, in which I asked for them to be fixed before commencing the lease. However, once the moving day is organised - I cannot simply cancel all of my plans to move if these repairs have not been fixed. Firstly, it usually is when my lease is ending and I need a place to live and 2) I have arranged movers to move my things on that date and 3) taking time off work/study cannot be rearranged easily. Therefore, they know you're stuck and all you can do is request it to be fixed once you're a tenant and note it on the entry condition report. In the current place I am renting for example: the shower doors were unaligned and subsequently water leaks out because of it. After numerous requests to fix it and towels being soaked (I needed to shower - it was inevitable) I then after 2 weeks accidentally flooded the place because of the shower. Now, I not only have to deal with their insurance but also them (double dipping) in trying to claim damages. I hear 'double dipping' is a very big problem in Queensland with the insurance companies claiming damages, and the lessor subsequently trying to claim damages with confiscating the bond. This NEEDS to be addressed within the Act to prevent double dipping from occurring so that tenants do not have to go to QCAT or the magistrate's court (for the insurance companies). "
"More freedom within the property management and allowance of pets. 
Also a say with Body Corporate bodies if located in a complex.  (you may not be the owner but you live there and are paying the owner you should have a say if tenanted longer than 12mths... )"
Landlords offering rentals are not a public service. Renting a property is already too overregulated that its almost not worth the drama and risk anymore.
"Regulate real estate agents / property managers, stricter rules for compliance with lease clauses"
"Allowance of pets
Decrease of inspections for long term tenants"
"Increased rental tenancy periods, and the ability to make small modifications such as picture hooks, painting walls etc."
I think real estate agents go too far with bond returns - Ie unrealistic expectations of normal wear and tear on a property especially when you already pay for a bond clean which is a few hundred dollars minimum
The application process and feedback
I would create the law which brings the tenants to take care of the rented place or to give the Landlord more power to keep the deposit for damages done to their homes
Well maintained properties.
Legislation and more specific guidelines to help protect both renters and owners financially.
Greater control over maintenance contractor selection with a managed rental property
Availability of pet friendly rentals
Respect for renters - whether people rent by choice or whether they cannot afford to buy a home 
Transfer of bond and able to end tenancy with4 weeks notice no break lease required.
Shorter wait time for bond refund when only signed by one party.
Not be charged rent loss when having to terminate the lease early
"Discrimination of single mothers.
Allowing of pets & allowing of pets inside properties
"
"The tenant who failed to pay rent or malicious damage the rental property should face more severe consequence, such as blacklist their name for a longer period of time, instead just for 3 years record in TICA.  Also should have a platform for Owner who self manage the property for checking the database of the potential tenant."
Owners need to be given more control over their investment property. In my experience within the industry in the last ten years there has been a huge swing towards tenants especially when matters escalate to a QCAT level.  
Tenants should have more rights and Landlords should be more accountable to properly maintain their properties 
Value for rent amount
"Bond amount does not cover repair bills left by bad tenants
No avenue to chase tenants who don't pay rent and are uncontactable"
"Posting of demands (i.e. water rates, promptly and on time."
Introduce a national / state rental application service so that potential tenants don't need to go through a time consuming form submission process for each real estate agent to apply for a rental property.
Bond refunds monitored by independent person
To not have to fill out forms before viewing and to be able to have pets and not be told how to clean your house before they do a so called maintenance  inspection. Also if you are paying to live at a property you should be able to treat it like a home and not like the landlord /agent is doing you a favour letting you live there.
Ability to keep pets
"WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE CONDITION OF A HOME.  WE PAY NEARLY $500 PER WEEK AND THE HOUSE WAS DISGUSTING WHEN WE MOVED IN. MANY THINGS DON'T WORK AND THE OWNER HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH, BOTH FOR US AND FOR THE PROPERTY MANAGER.  "
"no application approval process, if someone wants the house, just give it to them, getting references ect is a pain and dumb!"
Rid the pet owning stigma 
"The tenant is made to pay 2 weeks rent in advance when they sign a lease agreement.  But an arrears notice is only issued once they are 7 days in arrears, a notice to leave is issued once they are 14 days in arrears, and then by the time they vacate they are 21 days in arrears, leaving only 1 weeks bond for repairs, cleaning etc.  Rent arrears should be, once they fall behind being paid two weeks in advance.  Tenants know the system and play it to their advantage, and then its up to the landlord to claim everything on their insurance.  It's not fair."
"Make real estate agents have a fixed window in which to fix problems with the property, instead of just passing it off."
Would love more houses to allow pets. 
Make tenants more responsible for their actions
Rent prices are so expensive 
"'Every rental agent I've had has been absolutely hopeless. Examples of issues include:
- losing paperwork requiring resubmission multiple times;
- keeping me on a lease years after I'd moved out and submitted the forms;
- the owner got one of my rentals painted once, the painter did a terrible job and painted all our windows closed. "
Return of bond. Inspections not being done every 3 months
Remove requirement to resign a lease 3 months prior to lease renewals.
"Owners / Real Estate agents should have to ensure the property is in a fit state BEFORE tenants move in and if it isn't or the owners decided to do major renovations WHILE the tenant is in the property and having to organise contractors beyond a reasonable amount of time, the owners should not be able to charge rent for that period AND should be fined.  Currently I have moved in for less than two weeks and every day have had to deal with contractors to have the property renovated.  While RTA has a process to claim a small amount back, the owners are not inconvenienced for their time and the amt is so small it is worth it to them to inconvenience the tenant.  I am also an owner and would never do this.  I have had to arrange over 5 different contractors so far, it is immoral.  Also tenants fear that complaining will mean the owners don't renew their lease and may make invalid claims to the bond at the end, tenants suffer with a bad rental history but what do owners get for being unreasonable?"
Pet friendly especially in 'family' homes. Very hard.
Have an online forum to rate/comment on good or bad property managers and lessors. 
Have tenants understand their obligations.
ability to put a garden on property
Equal rights for owner and tenant 
Change in attitude. Not feeling like a second class citizen just because I rent
"Allow pictures to be hung, making the rental more 'your home'."
Tenants not going into arears for making rental payments
"'- fairer legislative system as it seems to be in favour of the tenants and not the owners
-take the grey out of the mould instructions so that someone becomes responsible
-cancel Property Manager's licences for incompetence
-have a rating system for property managers
-Privacy laws mean that foreigners espec NZers can wreck your rental property and disappear
-make it so that PMs have to hand over all the documents to the owners- they site the Privacy Laws for leaving owners in the dark
-subletting must stop- some tenants sublet their place- I have seen 9 beds in one bedroom
-review insurance as companies rip off the owners by nit picking - eg charging excess for damage on each item making it not worth claiming for
-property owners agreement has been changed so that Property Owners are no longer sure of what the role of the PM is"
"as a property manager, I would like to see a pet bond introduced in qld. other states have it and I think we need it to. also it needs to be more balance. too many rights to the tenant and the owners have less."
Improve the professionalism of rental estate agents
constant inspections and when leaving getting your bond back is difficult even paying for profressional cleaners the real estate finds something small to still deduct money. like small cob web up under the back of the toilet that is fixed to the wall ..
Real estate agents
Our latest renting experience has been good and there's nothing that requires improving.
The current systems allow bad tenants to consistently find new rental accommodation but good tenants are penalised and abused for being good tenants or for minor transgressions.  The rating of good tenants are at the whim of rude and unprofessional real estate agents who have no oversight or challenge. Good tenants are taken advantage of with agents imposing property maintenance tasks on the tenant which are the responsibility of the agent or owner. I feel real estate agents need more oversight with tenants having more ability to challenge the actions of the agents.  
To be treated like a human allowed to make a garden on the property not spoken down to by Young property inspection
Finding a different area that’s better 
Greater flexibility to hang a few pictures and add safety features such as child locks to cupboards and attach furniture to walls
Poor service and lack of communication and follow-up from real estate agencies 
Agents communication and transparency for tenants
"*Less frequent inspections for good/longer term tenants
*Quicker responses from Agents managing a property when issues arise that tenant needs outside source to repair/fix."
"Massive, unaffordable increases in rent despite being an excellent tenant eg always paying rent on time, maintaining property well, forcing a family to pack up and find cheaper accommodation when their intentions were to stay long term causing unfair and unnecessary financial and emotional stress."
More Pet friendly properties - I am lucky to be in a pet friendly home now but the search is hard when the times come around the move
A fairer system that balances tenant and landlord rights. And accurate answers from the RTA - we currently call 3 times and get the best of 3 answers - we never get the same answer or advice. 
"The ability to have a pet.
Fair/appropriate rental increases when wanting to renew a lease."
Easier to find a rental with a pet. Able to put up and leave a certain number of screws in wall for hanging artwork/photos etc. 
I've been fortunate enough to have good landlords
Better real estate Staff and better properties 
Ending the 6 or 12 month contract if the tenant is unhappy about neighbours or incidents that have happened. 
"Provide incentives to ensure faster turn-around on maintenance items being attended to.  I have waited sometimes more than 6-12months before maintenance items have been fixed, some critical water leeks as well as electrical problems.  I have had to in some cases serve ""Notice to Remedy Breach"" in order to expedite repairs that should be routine ( eg, broken toilet seat )."
"The time to evict tenants that have damaged a property, the process seems too long and drawn out and creates opportunity for more damage that in the end has to be paid for by the landlord and with no chance of recovery most times."
More flexibility with modifying the property and rules regarding pets. All properties should allow suitable pets.
"Somehow improve the respect afforded to those who rent rather than own, especially from agents"
I would change the Pet Rules to allow owners to choose whether they want pets in their properties. Pet free buildings should be allowed.
Having more flexibility to make the house a home
"Property managers to be easy to talk to and not think they are God , this is our Home !"
I would love to have more freedom to improve the houses that I’ve rented - even if some of those improvements come out of my own pocket.
"Easier to have a pet and able to hang pictures without getting into trouble or loosing your bond.  More transparency and education for property managers
"
Having repairs done within a reasonable time 
"Rental properties are often in a filthy state, unrepaired and sometimes just barely habitable"
Rent paid more frequently from our Agent...fortnightly not monthly
"Nothing. The status quo should be maintained. If tenants have issues, the systems are in place, through the legislation to deal with those issues. The only barrier to tenants having issues are their knowledge of systems available to them to manage any issues they may encounter, or lack of experience in renting. "
I pay 80% of my income on rent as a full time university student and this is the cheapest house we could find in the area. 
Better living circumstances such as insulation
Remove the charges real estate charge on top of your rent to pay rent but refuse to give you the option of paying cash so you are bound to pay additional fees
Make it easier for people with pets to rent
Communication between renter & owner..not manager
Enforce landlords to make repairs.
To have more of a voice and a little more power
"i would not allow a young big dog again on the property.
The dog ruined the backyard and lawn."
"Real Estate agents treat tenants like dirt, lack communication skills and don't follow requirements. - More training required for Real Estate Agents"
The option to pay rent from the renter's bank account to the bank account of the renting agency compulsory. 
Give landlords more rights
"It's hard to just list one thing, but one main would be is the fairness on the tenants.  External maintenance to the building shouldn't be the tenants responsibility when its just general wear and tear.   I currently feel being a tenant we aren't treated fairly and just a source of income for the landlords. "
"Give the Tenants more flexibility to make temporary improvements to the property 
like  putting up their curtains,  small tool shed, more parking for friends a swing or a slid  and  be able to small pets for their children and family to enjoy to make it feel more like a home  as moving from one home to another unsettles the children and the family  lifestyle "
"Allow wall hangings.

If house is for sale while agreement is in place - have a limit on how many inspections can be performed. I’ve once had 4 in a week. Just not that comfortable with so many opportunities for theft. Especially given that some agents DONT LOCK THE DOORS WHEN THEY LEAVE! "
"Remove the ability for landlords to have a blanket ""no pets"" rule without justification."
"The proposed changes to the pet laws need to be given special considerations for Body Corp buildings - to allow pets in every unit of a large Body Corp would seem to be a little unreasonable.  There should be a cap on the number of type of animals for the land sqm.  I don’t have an issue with tenants having pets, I currently lease 2 of my interstate rentals with tenants who have pets, it’s the disruption to others in high density residential living that I think poses a problem."
Easier dispute options when contesting an exit inspection result.
Being assured that landlords are compelled to carry out property repairs upon request
Real Estates continually taking bonds from the people struggling the most! (MIDDLE CLASS) 
"Rolling contracts .. having to renew every 6 months does not provide any security.
Less frequent inspections after 1 year or good  inspections. Inspections, every 3 months for 8 years without a single breach .. that's excessive."
Tenant rental payment needs to be improved in term of the rent arrears.
When you have a proven track record inspections further apart than every 12 weeks and freedom to put up pictures etc
Property Management by agents
"Reasonable rent charges. Regardless of what suburb you live in i feel that the amount of rent charged must reflect the condition of the house and property. ie. the age of the property, the upkeep on the property. "
"More oversight and action taken on those real estate agents who do not respond to your requests 
such as repair requests 

More flexibility for animals "
"Being able to call the place you rent ""home"". Able to personalise, less inspection."
"Less inspection, able to change the paint or hang pictures or fixtures without having to always get approval"
honestly cannot complain since moving to QLD - real estate extremely helpful and maintenance issues fixed promptly 
More rent to buy opportunities 
Being able to do more with the property as a tenant. 
Make renters pay for damages.
"Availability to have pets, allow tennants to have a say in body corporate meetings"
"Dreading the 6 month rent rise
Dreading the 3 month house inspections..our house is spotless and they still insist on coming every 3 weeks..and they shouldn't have tge right just to walk in when nobody is home."
How real estates manage rental properties should improve as well as the value they place on investing in people wanting to rent their properies. 
Need to be able to transfer bond when moving out and into another property. (only for good paying tenants)  It's alot of money to come up with twice
 Getting Appreciated by Property Managers not being treated as a 2nd class person
"Renters have very little power and are in quite a precarious position. We have had a situation where the property required repairs to life threatening faults but the owners delayed for many months because they didn't want to bear the cost. 

I was friendly with the our neighbours at that property, they were going through the process of replacing the fence between our properties and therefore had to work with the owners of our property - they informed me that the owners had an incredibly disrespectful attitude towards tenants (they often said to our neighbours 'but they're just TENANTS!', as though that makes us worthless). And truthfully for all the power we have to get acceptable outcomes under QLD law, we are worthless - tenants have very little power and it's very risky exercising the limited power we do have because we could very quickly wind up homeless if we get on the wrong side of the owner or agent."
"I would like to have a routine inspections more often. I moved from South Australia and since end of May up to now I haven’t had any routine inspections.
In SA we used to have routine inspections quarterly, even tough this sometimes was too much, but I think we need to find a balance, like at least twice a year or three times a year will get to the owners a sense of a properly property management and to the renters a sense of that they are looked after as well. "
Faster response from owners to rectify repairs & maintenance issues
"I would change how real estates view wear and tear of a property, especially carpet, and walls. Cheap carpet is in my rental property and impossible to keep up to the real estates expectations. Also the paint that is used on the walls is not very good and trying to clean them mostly leads to paint coming off. Also having a pet. My daughter needs a therapy pet but the owner is not allowing us to have one for her. "
"Tenants have too many rights, agents and landlords are left to pick up the pieces."
Lack of concern for tenants safety and rights. 
More power to tenants to carry out repairs when landlords refuse. More rights to have pets. Landlords should have to provide a valid reason for not renewing a lease. Longer leases - up to a decade or 20-years long.
"More comprehensive support for both sides. I for one had to go to/call the RTA several times to get proper information. Also, unreliable property managers should be penalised and not wrist slapped"
having ability to keep renting in a month to month basis after initial six month or year ageeement 
Enable Bond transfers also implement longer notifications for inspections if the agencys inspecting are wanting a clean and tidy result sometimes it hard doing this when life gets in the way. Also the option of Sat inspections so full time workers can attend if they wish. 
Landlords and property managers need to be monitored and audited more closely to avoid fraudulent activity 
"More freedom to make the house a home, but adding pictures on the walls andbeing able to own 1 or 2 pets within reason."
Which one thing do I state? Renting has become rediculous in too many aspects.
The ability to extend lease agreements to more than 12 months.
To know more details about the owner before choosing to apply.
"As a tenant, to have more reliable property managers, nicer landlords and freedom to make the home our, after all we are paying 30% of our take home income to pay of someone else's mortgage. "
Clarify definition of fair wear and tear. People can be absolute pigs and take no care or responsibility. Clearly a lack of respect for another persons property.
"The amount of landlords who do not allow pets to live at the house. Also, the neighbours who are home owners seem to think they have more rights than tenants do in the community. "
"I am in an NRAS property.   We have no idea what is going to happen to us when the 10 year time frame for owners comes up.   We do not know the owners, have no contact with them so we question what they will want to do.  Will the rent go up significantly? Will they want their unit back?  Will they sell it to someone else who wants to live here.  Will they get rid of us to put a higher paying tenant in?  The not knowing our outcome is extremely worrying and unsettling for us ""oldies"""
Obligations of the real estate and owners responsibility 
"A regular, perhaps annual, property maintenance program whereby property owners address general decay in their properties. This is an ongoing issue for anyone renting for several years. We've generally had little issue getting things that are broken fixed, but never have I seen an agent/owner account for the difficulty in e.g. cleaning a bathroom or kitchen with fittings that are so old repeated cleaning simply damages them further. This applies to gardens too, e.g. balding lawns that need more help than just mowing due to worsening soil quality."
Earning interest on rental bond
"Bonds should be able to be passed from one property to the next WITHOUT having to get it paid out and then just paid back. During property transition, you have to pay the new house bond before you can get the old house's bond back, very hard nowadays to come by that sort of money!!"
More flexibility to treat the house as your own. 
That owners have a say in references not just agent
Greater transparency and awareness of bad landlords and real estate agency practices. More accessible and affordable tenant dispute system.
Not taking photos during inspections 
One thing - make it easier to rent a place that will allow pets - dogs and cats.  Dogs and cats owned by a responsible owner do far less damage to a rental property than a 5 year old child.
"Accountability for damages caused by tenants, seems that too much is being dismissed by rental agents as wear and tear. Need to establish fair guidelines and make it stick. "
Have a Pet bond so my choices are not limited on where I can live just because I have a dog
Amount of notice a tenant can give 2 weeks  owner has to give 2 months
Ability to contact owner 
Have pest control paid by landlord 
allow for longer rental agreements
More long term housing security. It's stressful knowing that someone could make you leave your home every 12 months.
"My house is being sold, the constant disruptions when selling. Viewings, builder viewings, prospective owners, prospective owners and builders, real estate etc. About 7-10 entries within a few weeks. Also an entry without an entry notice to take photos for selling."
"Being able to hang pictures/have small animals without so much drama. Also to have less inspections by the realestate, having someone come into your home every 3 months is ridiculous. "
"How realestate agents deal with tenants on a overall basis, we are just as important as the owner, respect should be given both ways."
Prompter fixing times
the rent is too high and reasonable price for young adults is necessary
Have a regulated rental price per sqm instead of bedrooms 
It's almost impossible to find a place that will allow dogs.
The incompetence and rudeness of real estate agents and the ridiculous long-winded processes they make you go through to get approved for a property.
Landlord charging excessive cleaning fees when vacating property
As a property owner when things go pear shape the legislation and the law is always on the renter's side.  It is assumed that because we own a property that we have money to cope with anything they damage and they get away because it was never intentional to do the damage.  As a result we have lost thousands of dollars in either clean ups and fixing/repairing damage or in lost rent that we could not recover.  The tenant is always right and the laws are on their side!
"A little more leniency around personalising the house to make it home (pictures, curtain rods, painting walls) "
Landlords maintaining property 
Tenants damaging property and not being able to recoup money. I am very concerned that if the Federal Labour Party is elected  at the next Federal election negative gearing will be abolished. The returns for a property investor will no longer be financially viable unless rents increase.
"Fewer property inspections, currently quarterly. Allowing dog inside on lease. Default to continuing agreement at end of lease rather than requirement to sign a new lease "
Being a first time renter is extremely difficult to be able to find a place. Rental history is always a requirement or a guarantor agreement is hard to obtain
The lack of communication between property managers and their bosses and the landlords. 
A website for good tenants and property owners to meet.
I am a Real Estate Agent whose business manages approximately 350 properties It is my belief that to remove the right of a property owner to make certain decisions regarding their own property is ethically and morally wrong. People should have the choice to make their own decisions regarding their own property. To deny them such rights is neither morally or ethically sound even if it is made legal.  
The lack of tenant's privacy when applying for accommodation. Agents collect too much personal information about applicants and get multiple copies of documents. It is doubtful that they offer satisfactory data protection for all the collected information. This goes very often beyond the 100 ID points.
"allow pet's in all rental properties. It is so unfair that because pet's aren't allowed in most properties we have VERY little choice in properties to rent. This makes it almost impossible for us to leave the house we are in because we cannot find any rental properties that allow pets.

"
Consistency with real estate property managers
The high cost and inability to transfer bond with ease.
Only rent for the initial period of 6 months and not 12 months!
"I have had many bad experiences - I have one house in particular that has been trashed numerous times.  Once the house was managed by a real estate and the house had to be completely renovated.  This was one of those rentals that was attempting to look after a victim of Domestic Violence. One other time the people who were renting trashed the house and left everything in the house including the rats and walked out, never to be seen again."
It's very difficult to save the money for bond to move to a new rental property on top of paying for moving expenses. If bond could be transferred between properties it would be very helpful.
Allow longer leases 
"The feeling that some property managers think all renters are criminals who are going to try and trick the system or screw them over. Renting again after years of home ownership, I was really surprised by the way I was treated."
"Real Estate Agents that treat you like a human. listen to reasonable  request, expect reasonable wear and tear of the property over a long lease"
To have a more personalised home such as ability to fix pictures to walls and gardening etc.
Far less instpections
"tenants should give vacate notice 2 months prior to vacating just like the landlord has to. 
Two weeks notice is not enough time to find a new tenant hence the LL is out of pocket. "
Stop rent hikes every  time the lease is renewed
"Pet policy.  the only way around it is to purchase an assistance dog..we can not afford one, but any dog would be great to help my wife."
"Communication with difficult landlords impossible, seemingly low bar of qualifications and skills for leasing agents makes resolution of issues more difficult than it needs to be and processes need to have clarity of responsibilities and expectations. Legislation and mediation are meaningless when grey areas are disputed."
"If landlord has insurance, tenant does not need it to cover anything other than  their personal contents"
Less personal privacy invasion by landlord or real estate inspection.
Owner should have to fix things in a timely manner. And  real estate agents treating you like they are better then you. 
"Easier to search for rental properties online (a lot of rental websites are not up to date) and have a rating for each property based on location, price etc. "
Change the notification period for expiry of lease - it's too unbalanced. Tenants should have the same period for notification as landlords - one week is not enough time.
"Constant rental increases on 6mthly basis, lack of negotiation from owner on terms of lease length. Ability to negotiate up to 3 years for rental for stability and continuity."
Increase in number of properties allowing pets
"being able to make it home by hanging pictures or photo,s etc"
Listing to view a property & getting advice that it's gone beforehand. 
Inspections need to be limited to once every 6 months not every 3 months. Real estates and owners should respect tenants who keep their houses clean and tidy instead of telling me when my inspection will be- consult with me for a time and day that suits me. I don't like people entering my home when I am not there. 
Easier approval for pets
"Maintenance not being carried out, finding a place that allows long term family pets , we have two small dogs they don’t hurt anything. Real estate taking your bond after every effort by renter has been met when exiting.
The shit you have to go through to rent a property."
A.better more defined Definition of wear and tear 
"Being able to put up personal photos pictures on walls without approval
Have pets without having to seek approval
Re-decorate without approval
Cheaper rent"
Make it easier to have pets and minor modifications such as picture hooks etc. 
Getting things done more quickly if there is an issue with the property
The long notice that tenants have to have as to whether they will be renewing their lease or not.
"Owners through the RTA should have greater power to enforce compliance by tenants where there is a breach of the contract: ie. non payment of rent or other costs, damage to property, eviction.  It should not take a long time to evict a non-complying tenant."
Longer term rentals.
Better recognition of the investment made by owners in the property for rent.
Rental agents expectations. 
"More rights for renters - freedom to ask for items to be fixed in a timely manner, more notice of rent rises, proper reasoning for rent rises (not just because the owner feels like it), more rights for renters with pets"
"Take a larger bond as 4 weeks is just not enough anymore.  Also if a tenant doesn't follow the correct procedures - doesn't complete exit reports, ignores communication they should not be able to dispute claims made. "
Pets should be allowed in any residence.
the way realestate can enter the property when its being solid etc
Less house inspections. Once every 6 months for long-term tenants
I rent privately with good people so my experience has been awesome. Through property agents I have experienced a very holier than thou attitude.
1) treatment of single mothers is not equitable 2) rent costs is a huge stress 3) lease is not flexible - not longer or shorter than 12 months 4) agents communication is poor 5) pet ownership is impossible 6) can't even put up a picture on the wall
The underhanded ways that rental agencies find to keep bond money!
Change the three monthly inspection. 
A must for all rentals to be pet friendly but tenants pay a pet bond.
Give the owner more power to getting tenants out of the property quickly when in rent arrears.
More communication when applying for properties to rent. Structure of rent history.
 Rental tenancy being more secure long term for renters.  It is always worrying that a tenancy could be terminated with little notice and all in landlords favour.  Also the possibility of rent rises again with short notice.  Renters need to long term security.
Pets allowed more easier.
Affordable rental for long term renters. Especially for the elderly pensioners. These people are vulnerable & in many cases have no family to assist them.
Longer lease period
Honesty of Property Managers and ensuring that they follow legal requirements.
Allow pets at any property 
Adjustments to accomodate owners rights
Make it less competitive
Have my landlord replace the old refrigerator that has broken shelves. I am renting a fully furnished unit.
"be allowed to hang pictures on the wall, not be told how to use my space, too many inspections"
"Repairs to appliances approved by landlords faster, can often limit the tenant to what they can do, ie ovens or stovetops not working, makes everyday food preparation difficult. Air conditioners not working in summer is very uncomfortable"
"Drug test,  on tenants due to large amount mental health and drug issues in parts, of the public housing.
"
Not being treated like a second class citizen by real estate agents.
Be able to get out of an agreement with a Real Estate Agency
I would be putting more pressure on real estate agents to be more organised in how they deal with issues that Tenants raise about a rental property.
"I would like there more flexibility for responsible pet owners on the type and quantity of pets.
I would like to have professionals to do tasks and timely repairs around the property, not the landlord.
I would like all doors and windows to have locks."
Being able to make improvements yourself.
The amount of paperwork required to rent when you have rented for years without problems. 
"Moving into a new building is difficult specially with change of address, internet connections etc"
"Private landlords need to know boundaries, lessen number of inspections and the required inspection level. For example, expectation a house will look unlived in, looking in cupboards etc"
more consultation with property owners
"Not having to fear that if you piss off the real estate agent, that they will make your life really difficult."
High Rental Cost 50% of salary no assistance available 
Long term leases! 5 or 10yrs to settle and make a family home :)
"Should disallow landlords from being able to automatically reject tenants for owning a pet 

Align current tenancy laws with new Victorian tenancy laws, balancing power between tenants and property owners"
"It would be beneficial to renters to improve the amount of properties that allow pets and ensure the properties are pet safe. For example working gates, no holes in fencing, covered areas. "
"Lack of properties suitable for people with physical disabilities - no stairs/lift, suitable bathroom facilities, large enough rooms/doorways for assistive devices, adequate parking."
A fairer system at the end of the tenancy in terms of each party giving notice. I believe it should be 30 days notice on either side.
"get the RTA law fairer to Owners/Lessors - eg. ""Emergency Repairs"" authorised (without approval) up to 2 weeks of rent - that could be $1600-2000. The law does not take account of increased rent and property prices for the last 20 years. The amount should be capped eg. to $500 or so."
Home owners encouraged to improve energy efficiency in their rental properties without massively hiking the rental prices - so perhaps better incentives provided to them?
"Being treated like a subhuman with no rights.
You dont have a question about renters privacy and feeling safe. Experiences of having no right to refuse invasion of privacy or strangers in home.
Photos of a clean tidy, undamaged home filled with tenant owned furniture and personal items are taken. I dont have any family photos up because not allowed hooks in bare walls and dont want my children's faces distributed around the internet without knowing who ends up with them.
 Every 3 months and stored how....???and given to landlord who does what with them????? 

Child safety concerns about people who freely are given keys to do with what they want. We are forced to ""trust""without question and are bullied if try to refuse entry due to working schedules and people home alone. do agents ,maintenance workers, and landlords have blue cards???? Why not!!!! They all have opportunity and access to be around under 18 children at work, they should have a child safety blue card. 

3 monthly
Inspections rights  for tenants same as open houses

For sale open house!!!!!!! 
No compensation, no veting or record of strangers entering home. Voids content insurance, criminals get free view to see floor plan,  possessions and how many children, females. I feel people in power with money dont bare the risk and costs of these free for all, open access to our ""home"" hahaha no their wealth building asset occupied by subhuman tenants with no right to reasonably refuse entry to strangers. Tenants do.   

"
People on the aged pension get commission on their water usage
"Reasonable prices, more pets allowed properties "
"most tenants think that they can destroy, steal & not pay rent & they get away with it the law should protect properties from these sort of people"
Never rent directly from owner
More competition between tradesman.   ... More tradesman.
Be in a better maintained house
More flexibility to rental contracts. Owner ask three months in advance for us to sign next lease. 
"More landlords allowing pets. Complex managers being monitored more strictly as our current managers have done all they can to intimidate, belittle and threaten us out of our rental property so far without much assistance and awaiting tribuneral to take this matter further. "
Improve real estate agent integrity - in addressing maintenance issues and honesty at bond reimbursement.
Something ensuring general maintenance is done on a timely manner.
Punishment for when the rules in the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act is breached by either owners or rental managers.
"When we moved in the property was advertised as allowing dogs, we didn't have one at that stage but planned on getting one. When we asked a year later they said no. Both false advertisement and taking the way the right of the tenants to have a pet that they specified would be ok when we moved in. Also the lack of care of the safety of children"
Make all rental houses pet friendly.
make water registered to the tenant
I want to be able to have a dog. 
Swifter access to the property when tenants have defaulted on their payment.
"easily enforced law to ensure Real Estate Agents and Owners quickly comply with their responsibilities to tenants without drawn out complicated legal process that owners and agents understand and have the financial means to  make things sway against the tenants of Queensland who are normally at a financial disadvantage.Penalties for agents and owners who mislead tenants on their rights.
Start rating managing agents so tenants know if they have a good record.  "
Set up a rating system for both tenant and home owner so they will responsible to decision they made.
"I own rental properties and I feel if we get a bad tenant it is damn hard to get them out of your house in some situations, these laws need to change as I feel the owners have less right than the tenant even though they own the home. We had to have the real estate take a tenant to court 3 times to have them removed, each time they cried they had no where to go so the magistrate gave them more time in the home and all this time no rent was paid and we never got any back, in the meantime we were $3600.00 out of pocket for lock change out and then we had to clean and the bond did not cover it all."
"I'm not sure how to go about it, but I think landlords needs to be held more accountable in terms of adequate and timely repairs to rental properties. Under the current system, you can request a repair from a real estate agent, who then passes it on to the landlord, but the landlord must then operate in good faith to carry out that repair. Sure, you can issue a breach notice but for renters this really is a last resort action if you're wanting to have the lease renewed the following year and are worried that the landlord won't renew if they consider you to be too much trouble."
"two things -
1 - Make tenants accountable for property damage , including junk removal
2 - Give agents the power to evict bad tenants ASAP"
"More power for tenants in bond disputes. Ability to have pets without approval or disclosure on application.
"
Affordable rent and animals on property.
"Some of the conditions of some of the properties that are available for seniors to rent,and the high cost of some of the properties that are priced way beyond the conditions of the properties "
Having more properties that allow pets - as tenants are already responsible for any damage that occurs to the property. 
Property Agents are HOPELESS!!
Only allow CPI rent increase 
protection from the growing disrespect for property due to sense of entitlement to have the right to live according to own style regardless of the damage done to other's property or living conditions.
"When ""breaking lease"" there should be clear process to follow. As it is other than the formal notification - Form 13 - after that you are at the mercy of the agent /landlord. No set time frame for the property to be listed, where it is to be listed and no set fees/charges laid out in policy. 
There are many areas that need clarification or clear direction in the rental market."
Better service from real estates
Land Rates in Remote areas is too expensive compared to the value of the property
The feeling that if there is an issue for major maintenance that the lease will not be renewed 
More pet friendly rental properties in city locations. 
"I resent having to pay a fee to pay my rent, I.e. Postal money order, bank check, or Rental Rewards Credit Card. Prefer internet options."
Agents constantly recycling renters and charging postage fees when everything is via email
"More openness to contact the owner for billing enquiries, where a town house manager is involved. Example where a townhouse manager just passes on an invoice for water bill saying that the owner wants you to pay and in this instance you cannot contact owner to confirm, if that is what they have requested and you have to pay the bill."
Get a job to be able to afford a nicer home
"1. All rentals should honour pet friendly allowance 

1.Real estate agents 
"
more penalties for tenants who cause damage to property. 
"It should be much easier to rent with pets. As it stands pets can be rejected based solely on the owner's whim. Given how many Australians own pets, and how many Australians rent, these rules should be changed."
"Ensuring renters were responsible tenants and made to pay promptly and quickly, for any damage caused by them that was not considered to be fair wear and tear."
"Tenants rights with regards to open houses when an owner decides to sell & transparency when entering into a  lease if the owner is intending on selling. 

Eg  Our current rental we were after long term for stability of our children. 
2 months into a 12month lease we became a “show room house” with people coming through it causing instability to our household (especially our children who are uncertain if/when we will be moving). 
Had we known the owners intent we would not have entered into this lease. "
"Good tenants, with a good rental history (no damage to properties and payments always made on time) should be treated with more respect by agents.  I always feel like a ""lessor class citizen"" in the eyes of the agent when applying for a property to rent, however I have a perfect rental history."
Property managers who are on power trips and try to screw tenants over.
"The last 10 years have been difficult for landlords in greater Brisbane.  Two key points that I would like to mention:

1)	Unbalanced notice period for end of lease renewal/rent increases

Previously two weeks notice was required by either a tenant or a landlord to renew a lease.  However this has now been changed whereby a tenant only has to give two weeks notice as to whether or not they will renew a lease but a landlord has to give eight weeks notice.  In reality this is not balanced as real estate agent managers ask landlords approximately 3 ½ months prior to a lease expiry as to whether to increase rent at the end of a lease renewal with approximately one week to respond.  (Three and a half months ahead is a long time in advance to be able to accurately/fairly predict the market.)

This I feel is unbalanced.  I believe a more fair situation is the original two weeks notice by both sides of a rental increase and lease renewal (Two weeks notice by landlord and two weeks notice by the tenant.) or if insufficient then it should be equally four weeks notice by the landlord and four weeks by the tenant.   


2)	Increases in council rates above inflation

For the last 10 years there have been substantial increases in percentage increases with many years being an increase over 4.5%. (Ipswich City Council).  Rent increases for much of the time have been flat or at most at inflation with it being well under 2%/year.  I believe that council rates should not be increasing substantially above inflation and realistically should reasonably be limited to be more in line with the rate of inflation.  Without this being the case it just unfairly puts more pressure on landlords and discourages them from providing accommodation.  

Whilst there are other issues, if these two issues can be seriously considered I think it would be a more fair outcome.       "
The respect or lack there off between real estates and tenants. 
Easier searches to find black listed tenants 
Making real estate agents work for tenants equally as landlords
be able to change the rental inspection period based on good performance to greater than 3 months (e.g. 6 months or more)
Property manager on power trips who give other property managers a bad name
"As an owner of a rental property, the best thing for me would be to sell the property as I am effectively subsidizing the tenant but if I did so at present, I would incur a significant capital loss."
"less inspections
able to have pets
nicer agents"
Make the process faster and have more viewing dates also make sure the agent turns up with keys for the viewing
Educated property managers that understand and abide by the legislation 
Less inspections every 6 months instead of every 3 months.  Have been in same property for 8 years if there were issues with us as tenants about maintaining property we would have heard by now
The definition of fair wear and tear to make it less ambiguous.  
"Have a set definition of ""normal wear and tear"" for ALL Queensland property managers. 
This is such a subjective term. 
More definition is required for property managers. "
"Make it easier for tenants to have items fixed when they are broken - at the moment, agents & owners can get away with not fixing items and as a tenant it's very difficult to have any power."
Landlords having to accept pets.
"The three monthly inspections. We have lived in the same property for over 8 years, and have an inspection every three months without fail. There should be increased time between inspections for long term rentals. It is onerous on tenants to have this occur. We have had over 50 inspections with no breaches or issues. "
"Balance my rights, expectations and required transparency as a tenant to those of the landlord. Provide the RTA with some power."
price of rental property so expensive. smoking of neighbours should be done inside their premises. rental agents always wants to get hold onto your bond and try to find faults even thoug you lookafter the property very well. e.g. mold that is not the tenants faults. 
"private rentals with no inspections - this needs to be monitored
rental agencies discriminating against people applying who are on pensions
tenants black listed if issuing the agency with breach notices"
Individual property managers interpretation of legislation
routine inspection processes
"Having more freedom to use my home how I want to. I have been in this house for over 7 years and I am still treated by the real estate agents as if I have no rights. Tenants should be allowed to have pets; we should be able to sub-lease the premises or hire out a night here and there (eg on airbnb) as anyone living in their own house can; we should not being pestered every three months for an inspection; and we should be allowed to enforce our right to privacy, ie: not have photos taken of the property without my permission. Agents should not have the right to enter for a routine inspection if the tenant wants to be present and is not available when requested, an agreement should be made for a mutually agreeable time. "
Improve responsiveness and professionalism of property managers (especially the way they deal with tenants).
Availability of more pet friendly properties
I would change the frequency of inspections to every 6 months
"Property managers are difficult to deal with due to their possible stigma against renters being lower class income, I realise friendlier property managers cannot be something you would change but it would definitely assist. One other thing is the pricing of rentals seems very inconsistent in certain areas making certain suburbs seem incredibly over priced. "
Much better informed rental managers with empathy for the tenant
Assistance from Social Services to the Tenant be sent directly to Landlord as quite often the Tenant gets the assistance but does not pass it on to the Landlord (ie doesn't pay the rent)  !
Better communication between landlord and tenant
More autonomy to do s8mple things like hang pictures
Not so limited to being able to rent with a dog 
"Property managers treat tenants as second rate citizens. Whenever there is an issue to be resolved, they treat tenants as guilty until proven otherwise."
Things to be fixed that require urgent looking into and not have to continually keep chasing a landlord that won't and doesn't want to fix things
"As an owner of a rental property which will be my super when I retire. I believe landlords have limited say in what we can and cant do with our properties as the current law stands. I am concerned that my hard earned, investment property will be out of my control and I will be forced to sell it as the risk is to high. The cost of owning a rental home is far more than most tenants pay in rent. Surely we deserve the right, within reason, to say what can and can't happen in OUR property. Before the haters start. I allow pets upon application to our home and have never denied anyone with a pet but I want that choice. I also don't mind if they put up some pictures but again I don't want 40 holes in my wall. I want the choice. I pay for the house which gives them a home."
"I would like to see a (legal) change or introduction into individual tenant accountability. I have been made to fix and pay for damage that housemates have made. Despite being able to substantially prove it wasn’t I.
So if there was something that can seperate the liability of people that would be great. I.e. claiming a certain room and signing for it and then being solely responsible for any damages.
And separately - more assistance or more options when others don’t pay their rent. I have been forced to pay missing rent that others have missed. So if there was a tighter way of managing individual tenants within the one household. I think that would be beneficial."
"Fairer rights to Landlords, especially around break lease scenario's. QCAT decisions should be based on prior decisions plus request evidence in situations such as excessive hardship. 

As a tenant, it would be nice to have more options when the owner decides to sell/conduct open homes."
Too heavily tenant- focused. Legislation needs to be balanced
"Agents rudeness, superiority and stand over like tactics.  I am very house proud but am always shocked at the attitude of the agents. "
The price is too expensive to rent and makes it impossible to save for my own house.
More support for property owners - tenants have too much control over property that is not owned by them
"That landlords/real estate treat good renters with more respect. I understand that they have strict policies to abide but I believe I am a great tenant. Never not paid rent on time, no Damage to property, never received warning/negative feedback/warning etc and my current landlord/real estate can’t  have the decency to respect some of my requests which include a pet, black out blinds to main bedroom as I am a shift worker. I think things like this should be granted where credit due. I work hard to maintain their property in top condition and respect them and it often feels like simple requests are ignored or they simply do not care or do not want to spend money on GOOD tenants "
"Power of rental agents re bond refund, not allowing for fair wear and tear as I've stayed in properties at least 5 years at a time."
The level of attention to detail from both owner/property manager and tenant when it comes to entry condition reports - we had a new management take over our property and they didnt come see the house or take any photos so there were a lot of arguments when it came to the exit report about what damage was and wasn't there when we moved in. Luckily I had taken photos myself and could prove it.
"The problem is with the real estate agents. They need to be held accountable for looking after the tenants rights as well as the landlord.  Too many times as a renter I had to chase and chase for things to get fixed, and then they argued 'damage' on a property when I moved out and harrassed me to try and keep my bond even though the tribunal found in my favor after I went through the process. They are greedy. They also put the rental prices up above local market value at every lease renewal because they know it's too hard/expensive to move."
More affordable rent for people on pensions
timeliness of different maintenance items
"Automation of common tasks ie repair requests, rental payments etc"
More flexibility with move out date at the end of a lease.  Hard to find a new rental to begin exactly when the old lease ends.
Better communication from real estate
More affordable houses for people who earn under $60k
More transparency and contact from owners and real estate 
Being able to negotate rental increases and how far it is. Our house is compared to the suburb which includes properties on the beach and creek front. It should be compared like for like with a cap % 
"As a landlord, I feel that insurances and council rates are ridiculously high compared to the rental income which I receive."
Make it easier to have a pet
"'-Allow pets/ dogs
-Better service from real estates 
-Accountability for real estate agents"
Less inspections and more freedom making it feel l8ke our home not just a house 
"Length of time between inspections.  We have never had a bad one, get good feedback every time.  Terms say 3 -4 monthly and we had been getting 4 monthly now back to 3 monthly to suit their schedule. We fix things ourselves and never bother agent, really annoying having someone here every 3 months when we are excellent tenants."
Unlimited term contracts
Renters in Cairns are considered low class and are treated as such.
Quite often when you view a property it's not like the picture and you've wasted your time. Agents should be made to use current pictures not the one's from years ago when the property was built or purchased. 
Land Tax reductions for providing subsidised or affordable housing.
Allow pets without approval 
A consistent way of reporting issues to rental manager/landlord. Most of the time I have found it to be good but there are times when issues slip through the cracks.
Better enforcement of cleaning by previous tenants
Pet approval in rentals - it is currently very difficult or impossible to get rentals to approve pets.
"Less red tape for applications, more support from real estate agencies while they manage properties"
Allow me to have my place as my place: hang pictures; paint walls
Being treated as a second class citizen
Less paperwork if there is a dispute.
Easier access to our property
Agents are very bad at managing their tenants
I am a pensioner and my biggest fear is that I will have to move. I need to have stability in that area.  
"More flexibility in what you can do, fixes, hooks etc"
Prompt response to repairs 
Abrupt house sales. 
More comeback against poor property managers for owners. 
Nothing. Our agents and owners are fantastic
If Tennant  not paying or destroying property it shouldn't  take so long to get them out
Shorter timeframes when taking action against tenants not doing the right thing.
Rude realestate agents with too many rules 
Allow reasonable requests and behaviour to be rewarded
Clearer pet regulations that make my decision as an owner to not allow tenants to have pets unchallengable
"'the frequency of inspections: It's insulting and an invasion of privacy to have inspections every 12 weeks - I am a responsible renter and own multiple investment properties. 
Ensuring I am at home when inspections are undertaken takes me away from work. In addition, a two hour period is nominated for the inspection - which means I have to be away from work for two hours because I don't know when the agent will turn up.
Feedback from my last inspection was :
- clean around the base of the toilet (no males live in my house and a bit of dust isn't going to damage the toilet bowl nor impact on the value of the property)
- sweep the laundry (I don't have a laundry to sweep - I have a cupboard with a washing machine and sink). 
Inspections are to check for damage, not to judge people on their cleanliness. 
An inspection every 12 weeks when I have lived in the property for 18 months is over the top - I pay my rent on time and keep the house clean. 
There needs to be some compromise when it comes to inspecting properties - in terms of number of inspections per year and making a specific time for inspections
"
"1.  Longer term leases
2.  More ability to connect with the Lessor
3.  More training for those involved in the industry (by this I mean BETTER training)
4.  Relaxation of Tenants rights when renting
5.  Relaxation of Pet ownership for Tenants."
Less restriction around pet ownership
"Longer leases, ability to hang pictures/mirrors/whiteboards etc, paint the walls."
"Change demeaning application process of some of the larger agencies,  nothing personal happens,  yippy ate simply something to get done for the day"
More liaison between RTA and QCAT 
"Allowing pets. hanging pictures, etc"
Give lower income earners a fairer chance at obtaining a rental property without being treated like a second class citizen. Being assessed as an individual rather that as a statistic. 
"The company we rent through has traditionally been atrocious with their standards of upkeep, manner and communication. It feels like they have all the rights and we either conform or move. "
"More flexibility.
More options
More respect
More ability to work negotiate with the landlord/agency"
Strictly enforced access to house when we are not available to be there laws. Please do not be in our home when we are not there.
Real estate being understanding that people work full time so can’t drop everything to be home when they want to enter the property 
"The inspections undertaken every three months by the Agent needs to be stopped.  It is highly stressful and unnecessary to have your life interrupted because of this, especially when the tenants are older like me and my family (early 50s, late 60s) and have a proven rental record of over 4 years at the same property."
Larger bond to cover damage and absconding tenants
"More emphasis on the quality of the people renting-putting in applications to rent-  and less on the 'Brisbane' specific references. We arrived in Brisbane after renting a high end property in Dubai, however the local real estate agents would not accept overseas references- very parochial."
Air conditioning and affordable rent for families 
I am a single mum with two boys that have disabilities and it is hard to get a place at a cheap enough price for me to afford. I am $20 over the limit of how much I have as income(studying not working) for a housing commission house and rent is so high that I can not afford a decent rental. I would definitely want to have more available housing for people in my situation so I and my family can afford decent housing through NRAS being applied to that particular house I want to be renting.
Competent real estate agents who treat you like a human
Tenants do not have a care about property
Less inspections like once a year unless your previous  Inspection was not to standard 
"I think the deposit refund system is good but liable to abuse. Statistically you should be able to determine the norms of high/low charges for both tenants and owners. I think it likely (emotive judgment on my part) that some owners, or their agents abuse the system by over servicing and over charging. Sure some properties are more at risk from tenants than others - but reasonable stat. maths. standard deviations, and such like, and the RTA must have a significant number of leases, would identify those significantly at variance."
"Being able to decorate within reason (putting up pictures, changing blinds to curtains) "
"As a renter if I have a problem with the real estate agent, I cannot make a complaint for fear of being black listed, or given a negative reference for my next rental.

"
Less inspections on long term renters
"That both the Property Agent and Landlord have verifiable references to give the Renter. The whole system is pretty well directed to giving the Property Agent and Landlord an abnormal amount of favour. the system has a less than satisfactory level of breaches against property Agents and Landlords. In some agencies there are a preponderance of reason for breaches against which won't be moved after rectification. If an agent breaches and is slow to react to solve the problem, tenants should get breach credits. We hear of bad tenants but very little about recalcitrant agents. What I am saying there should be a level playing field. "
"More regulation on things that are used in the building/furnishing of rental properties, ie dryers that are of good energy standard "
Better security for tenants
"Make it more mandatory to have owners allow pets. As a pet owner and having worked for the RSPCA I have seen how tragic it can be to try and rent a place that won’t low pets.

I understand that the owner had the right to refuse in a home they own, but in turn this puts a strain on the animal welfare system and causes people to give up loved pets. They are torn between being able to have a place to live or giving up a member of the family.
"
"Requirements for tenancy and vacating - real estate agents are extremely judgemental and behave with a sense of power that can be intimidating and discriminatory towards people. Actual landlords who realise humans reside in their property. I know a cohort of tenants are problematic - this discredits others who have genuine regard and care for the property as this is ‘home’. 

"
"Owners need to held accountable for the houses they rent out.  Such as, dodgy work, dirty, old, cannot even do any repairs or maintenance.  They are happy to take your money every week, but when it comes to a request, they avoid it."
"Less frequent inspections. After living in a home for 2 years and proving you look after the home, inspections are not necessary every 3 months. "
to make it easier to use the bond/deposit to cover unpaid rental payments or damage/repairs when a tenant moves out.
"In QCAT hearings , the tenants should be made fully liable for the damages caused to the rented property.

Currently , the property managers are saying that the appointed adjudicators tend to favor or lenient to the tenants even though they are damaging the property with property manager reports.

Landlords end up having to spend more monies fixing the damages."
"The discrepancy in time between not renewing a lease and finding a property available for your approximate dates. Leases often need to be confirmed a month or more before your previous lease expires but new rentals are often only advertised a couple of weeks before they are available, basically you have to commit to being homeless."
The unfairness of renters being able to give only two weeks notice but Landlords have to give 2 months.  It should be the same amount of time both sides
Making it easier to rent with children and pets.
Situations involving the sale process of a current rented property
Greater rights of Landlords!
Process on reporting for repairs on the property
The negative relationship immediately undertaken by the property manager /owner
Pets should be allowed as a standard part of the contract.
Doing away with a bond.  Being able to have pay extra into a trust fund to assist with a house deposit.
Flexibility of tendency terms. Transparent return of bond process.
More power to the tenant. There is a real power imbalance.
"Recently moved into a rental, two out of four Air conditioners do not work,  Satellite dish (Foxtel) has been removed from property,  Had to obtain permission to install again and pay $100 service engineer to visit and install new dish.   Agents should test all appliances and fitting to make sure they work.  Now I have to wait for owner to approve repairs that should have been identified prior to us moving in. "
"The rules around properties being put up for sale mid tenancy agreement are too far in favour of the landlord. I am unable to end my agreement without penalty mid agreement, however a sale allows a short notice period for the tenant to vacate. This is disruptive. Also, expecting tenants to allow for multiple valuations, open homes (often excessive) does not allow for reasonable use of the property. This is my home and I should have uninterrupted use of it, other than for normally scheduled inspections."
Lower rent prices
more clear rules around what is a significant general breach. Tenants who do not take good care of the property should be evicted. 
I think property restrictions or special conditions need to be clear when advertising a place.
Property Management is low quality.  
Pets allowed in all properties
We are Landlords and are incurring extreme financial hardship through tenants not paying the rent
The rules around breaking a lease of more than 6 months/long term tenant 
Less fear by having more rights as a renter 
"Better quality property managers at real estate agencies.  Most are barely adequate in their conduct, and allow properties to fall into arrears, fail to report or attend to repairs, and fail to pay utility accounts, leaving the landlord to incur bad debts.  A conscientious property manager is hard to find."
"Find a competent property manager, good tenants require less inspections."
Ability to hang pictures
To make the real estate more accountable for their actions
Tenants can stop paying rent 4 weeks out from leaving when they know they have damaged your property and there is basically nothing you can do till after they have left. Needs to be stricter rules and have ability to act quicker on bad tenants.
A fairer process to monies owed by tenants to landlords. Damaged cause and classed as fair wear and tear
"Train real estate staff customer service skills. They are rude, obnoxious and down right disrespectful.  (Past experience)."
renting agencies having to inform you when you property is moved from one agency to another. This notice should be given in a formal way e.g. letter to the property or email to tenants. 
Allowed to put up photos and make the house feel like a home. 
Improved ability to negotiate rental increases without the threat of having lease offer withdrawn
Accountability and clear guidelines for Property Managers and Landlords to the renters
"My current arrangement is great but in my previous rental, the owners did not want to fix problems, eg antenna not digital so I would like to see owners being more reasonable in relation to repairs and maintenance"
"'- Allow pets - Depending on the style of dwelling.
- Better systems to audit the quality of private rentals to renters.
- Clarity on real estates offering certain dwellings on 'undercutting' style deals.
"
"OK, but having to deal with removalists is a mess sometimes, no proper process and they mostly prefer cash payments, great to have some process to govern around this.
Trouble getting services connected to new addresses sometimes for example internet service, etc. I believe gov't can do something around the process to make this easy for tenants.
I like the bond system which looks working great for both tenants and owners.
It's good to have a verification system to ensure property is same as it was when tenants leaving the property, for example evidence capturing,etc. different agencies, people follow different ways to do it, there is no standard way so it's good to have some process/routine around it."
Clear rules/laws to safe guard the property from being unlawfully and mindlessly damaged by disrespectful renters. 
"Better training for PM's, especially how non compliance of legislation can impact both tenants and landlords"
Property managers shouldn't be allowed to be so harsh with inspections. Every 3 months we would take time out of our jobs and lives to basically bond clean our house because the property manager was relentless. The house was well looked after lived in but we were on trial every 3 months and it was incredibly stressful.
Pet friendly should be compulsory 
"Less inspections, insist owners have to offer a 1 year option once you have been there for a year, not just continual 6 month extensions OR only allow them to raise the price once per year. Ensure price raise is in line with CPI. Provide much more autonomy to the renter to do things in the house like pictures etc. After all, the renter is still responsible to return the house in the same condition so whats the issue?"
Always allow pets
Allowing dogs in more properties 
More ability to have pets in rental accommodation and less house inspections.  I rented a property for five years and had house inspections every three months even though the property manager's reports were glowing!
The 2 week notice period at the end of a lease is not sufficient
Longer rental terms but easier exits from lease agreements. Landlords have to stick to their word when it comes to changes in the home. 
Shorter time for dispute resolution
I think there needs to be accountability to hold the property managers responsible for failure to provide decent living conditions for the tenants. I had a leaking gas tap that leaked for 5 months and I got around $1100 worth of gas bills. My property manager kept saying the owner didn’t want to fix it. There needs to be $$$ aside for these repairs so they can be authorised and fixed. I also think pets should be allowed. Within reason of course. Not having a Great Dane in a unit but something like a Shih Tzu in a unit I see no issue. 
People saying they are willing to pay more to secure property. Realestate knowing people and putting them first.
More pet friendly rentals 
The ridiculous price of rentals. I have paid over half my income for rent in recent years. I am extremely thankful to finally secure a NRAS property in the last 12 months.
"Need to organise long term rental, not just 6 months or one year, under RENT CONTROL.   Landlords not permitted to raise rent just because they can each year."
Control of animals when renting out my property 
Stop landlords issuing a lease renewal 2mths before lease is up and threaten to issue notice to leave if you dont renew.  Very unfair.
Better selection of tenants 
As a landlord I would like to retain the choice to say no to pets in my property.
"Increase rents-costs of maintenance, rates and insurance especially give little benefit to a landlord"
More information for renters about rights and responsibilities in greater detail.  RTA only provides so much information and is very vague on some issues.  
Tenants do not have as many rights - should not be subjected to constant inspections and hassling. When the shoe is on the other foot and the property managers/owners need to assist tenants they do not have the time of day. Renting is also unaffordable to many and so competitive.
Landlords have more respect for tennants
Greater acceptance of pets 
More freedom to personalise the house into a home. Being able to hang photos. And not so hard to rent with pets
Know my rights and act on laws in place.
Fairer rights for landlords
Being able to make the rentals more child friendly being able to fasten furniture to walls and so on
Remove the reference requirements which are useless and impacting tenants privacy.
Less invasive house inspections. More pet friendly rental options. Less ridiculously high rents
"Tenants being allowed to decorate the home, eg hanging up pictures, painting walls etc"
Allow pets in all homes
For everyone renting to be allowed pets. 
More affordable rent....i pay just under half of my disability pension and allowances.
Tighter regulations to do background checks of prospective tenants. 
Property Managers that don't try and rip off tenants on depature by faking / exaggerating damage.
Landlords making repairs in a timely manner. 
Less papers work 
Greater accountability for landlords
Allow pets and hang pictures
Abandoned goods requirements changed to allow easier disposal
Research my property managers better
The amount of inspections if renting in one place for more than 1yr
Better vetting of tenants as some appear great on paper but then fall behind on payments and also damage the property 
Hanging pictures on the walls
"Being able to hang a few pictures by using proper hanging nails and not that stick on stuff that pulls paint off.
  "
"Rental ledgers automatically being sent out by agents each quarter via email to provide tenants with a payment ledger for their own records.

Having working blinds in my lounge area, they were broken when I moved in and I have asked on numerous occasions about getting them fixed.

Getting the railing in my bathroom fixed, which was broken when I moved in. I took photos upon entering the property and over time it's getting worse as it gets knocked when entering and exiting the bathroom. I have pointed this out to the agents upon inspection and to date, nothing has been done.

Aside from those two things, there's nothing else really wrong with my property. It's kept in immaculate condition at all times as I am a minimalist and don't like clutter."
longer term tenancy agreements to provide greater security.
More properties/landlords accepting pets
I'd like to have an automatic right to have pets. Pet friendly housing is hard to get.
"Allowing animals to live in units or at properties appropriate to their size (cats in units, big dogs in yards)"
simplify the forms for tenancy so that they cannot be misinterpreted by the magistrates 
"If owners would use a licensed trades person to make repairs and not an unlicensed handyman with little to no knowledge about any thing.

 "
"Entry condition report carried out by the agents is pathetic it misses 40% of obvious defects, tenants shouldn't be required to do this job for the agent.
It is common practice for agents to require tenants to submit maintenance request forms for defects noted in these reports that should have been fixed prior to the tenant  moving in."
"There is no security other than to the end of your 6 or 12 month lease: make 3-5 years the norm.
Three monthly inspections are overly invasive. It doesn't matter how well you look after the place, the estate agent still comes out every three months to make sure, it's degrading: make inspections annual at most.
"
More certainty for renters and improved communication
"Being able to communicate to the landlord directly and to be able to arrange inspections when we are available to be home - it's not a nice feeling that strangers are walking through where you live and all your valuable/personnel items are there for anyone to see/heaven forbid, tell others. "
Allow animals under 10kg as standard for QLD rental properties.
Bond needs to be higher than 4 weeks rent as $1000 to $2000 dose not take care of basic damage and cleaning costs. 
"Allow tenants to lobby for a fixed term period if a on periodic agreement. Landlords should be compelled to explain to the tenants and RTA why they can't offer a fixed term period lease and be accountable. 

Have repairs be conducted in a timely and acceptable manner. 

When essential services (such as hot water) are not available, the rent should automatically be reduced to compensate for the time waited for repairs and the lower quality of housing provided.  "
"All rent should be means tested for placement with a sensible realistic, calculated ceiling amount based on State average of wage."
Longer leasing agreements. 12month lease for a family is too short. 
Minimum standards rental properties should be maintained at.
I want to be able to have a pet dog
"As the landlord and the ability to evict unsaying tenants and QCAT experience has been unpleasant, time consuming and stressful."
Property managers with no clue about the tenants rights 
"My pets cause less damage than my friends children, yet not only do I have to jump through hoops in order to be allowed them, but they also dictate that they must remain outside and seperated from their family. "
Options to direct debit rental payments with no delays or fees.
That the landlords be better protected as its our houses we rent out.
"Let pets be part of the family.  We have been restricted in homes we can consider because we have a pet.  This has been very frustrating and has limited our ability to find the best value home for our family.
"
The house was put on the market only after 4 months into my lease with open homes every Saturday for 16 weeks which was a real inconvenience. The real estate lady selling the house showed no common courtesy or respect nor did she ever send a form 9 I think it’s called to enter the premises plus much more !! 
When moving out Real Estates make it extremely difficult to receive your bond back. They try and make you go through a professional bond cleaning company in order to give bond back in full. The expectation is so high it needs to be professionally cleaned even though it was not as great condition on arriving. This service costs $300 plus.
"Easier ability to have non compliant parties-non payment, too many occupiers- move out "
Changes to block discrimination based on having children. It's impossible to get a rental property because owners don't want children in their property's. 
"Being able to hang photos.
"
Building management that communicate/care about looking after the tenants
Having minimum safety/property maintenance requirements 
"Breaking a lease is way too cumbersome, imobile and costly for the tenant.. two weeks notice and no financial penalties should be applied to break a lease. I have rented the same property for 6 years, I think I should be entitled to  move without financial penalties. After the first contracted lease, tenants should have the freedom to break a lease without reason or financial penalties. "
Being able to personalise my home more. 
"more houses available that are affordable, too many people whio are good tenants looking at the same house"
quicker responses to maintenance requests
"The ability to hang curtains, paintings. "
Real estate agents following through and looking after tenants.
"The availability of homes that are pet friendly, and the restrictions placed on pets that are allowed "
Being recognized as a long-term good tenant
"Speed up, clarify systems for bond lodgement and management of short term owner occupier rental"
The accessibility of the real estate agents could be improved. 
"Application process is ridiculous - like applying for a mortgage.
Competition.
Cost of living NOT comprable to the TRUE average household income (not the 'mean' calculated from an average of the extreme high end and homeless - but the true middle class ie. those on more accurately a household income of $30k<$50k/ year!)"
"Landlords rights for evicting bad tenants.
Reduced eviction notice periods.
And legislation around timing allowable for re entry for making good any defects by the tenants following exit report by the property manager."
"Most Real Estate agencies, especially big ones, act as they are above the law. Unfortunately, RTA is on their side."
I want to be able to treat a rental property like my home instead of something I'm afraid to touch for fear of never seeing my bond again.
Estate managers that will actually make the tenants look after the gardens and lawn.
"I have had some very negative experiences as a tenant in this country. I feel that I and my family are at the mercy of the landlords and property manager. I have experienced form 11's (notice to remedy breach) was issued without in my opinion a satisfactory reason for same. The issues raised were trivial (weeding to be done etc). 
I felt that I could not make a complaint to the RTA due fears of being given a bad report or blacklisted. The bonds are almost fully withheld at the end of the tenancy with cleaning costs being cited. The property managers side always with the landlord. I was given a notice to leave requesting vacant enjoyment of the property after they had increased the rent. I had to leave the property as my wife was almost due to birth to our child. I was terrified of being homeless despite not having done anything seriously wrong to the house. I believe that they wanted to replace our family with working professionals to be honest but I have no evidence of that. I do know that the property was shown to potential tenants after I received such notice and was rented out shortly after I vacated. 
Tenants need to feel supported when issues like this happen. There needs to be some way to challenge these decisions without fear of reprisal. The law around fair wear and tear and keeping the place clean and tidy is open to interpretation. Property managers should engage in dialogue before issuing breach forms especially for minor offences such as weeding needs done. I do not have one single good thing to say about renting in Australia. With regards to maintenance it appears to be either hit or miss if you have a landlord that carries it out.  "
Better communication from tenants who won't pay
Manditory 4 year contracts I have have lived in 8 properties in the last 4 fucking years. Lessors treat tenants like shit.
Should be legally allowed to continue after the fist contact without a new contact; allowed to leave at any time with reasonable notice.
Restricting the legislation around the unfairness of tenants being able to walk away from a tenancy agreement with no penalty. Break lease situations are becoming more common and investors have no rights protecting them. Tenants can give 2 weeks notice and walk leaving long drawn out Disputes and QCAT claims where an owner must prove over and above that they have mitigates a tenants loss but tenants are not liable to the loss incurred by an investor. Reforms need to happen around standard costs and processes making it equal for both parties in a termination arrangement with leases. 
"Make sure landlords have the money to complete repairs in a timely fashion – either give property managers the right to approve repairs, or tenants the right to withhold rent until repairs are completed. Tenants are powerless in the situation. "
Bathroom and kitchen facilities need to be updated to reflect the rates of rent being paid.
I would introduce laws exactly like victoria has with regards to tenants with pets.
"Renters having more rights (being able to own pets, make minor changes to place, able to fight unfair rent increases etc)"
Being able to hang more stuff up on walls 
"Being able to do small renovations such as adding an aircon or putting pictures on the wall, painting walls ( as long as it is added value to the property)"
Being allowed to make changes to the property if it is justified.
"To see pensioners rent remain at a financial manageable level. 
To be allowed to have a pet."
Less paperwork and more rights for tenants to easily get bond back at the end of a lease.
Longer lease terms
A quicker system to remove tenants not paying rent and damaging property as there is no bond money left
Damages done to tenants property from tbe home like from water that the owner has not fixed should be replaced by the owner
Be well informed of all services to the property including if internet is connected and available 
Cheaper rent or more assistance from Government.  Rent assistance used to cover approximately 50% of rent charged. Now it covers less than 33%
Decrease the amount of routine inspections 
Tenants with pets do not consider the property and have cost me a lot of money in repairs. Tenants who don't sign leases on time create financial risk because we have mortgage payments to make. Tenants faking references are everywhere.
"Level up the playing field between landlord and tenant.
Attitude of some letting agents needs a huge adjustment - maybe levelling the playing field would do that."
pay less rent
"My experience has been as a Landlord, I have been leasing our investment property since 2001"
Be able to speak direct with owners. Messages and requests do not always get passed on.
Have the agent treated tenant like human beings and not like nobody’s 
Legislate for tennants to give some amount of notice as landlord when not renewing lease.  As a landlord we are often left with a vacant property when tenants decide not to renew lease and give notice. 
Notice to tenant at end of lease should be shorter for landlords
Reliable and responsive agents and owners. 
More protection for home owners
"I am an apartment renter but laws around allowing residents to have pets should be tightened.
Also noise created by other residents outside approved hours."
More control over pet ownership
Get appropriate maintenance during lease ans seen more ownership interest
"It is hard when most of the issues are all personality related, but the biggest one is some property managers just making stuff up about what their rights are and yours are not."
"not having to worry about rental price increases because of the local economy e.g mining boom in area = increase in rent , not everyone is a miner. affordable rent for everyday people. "
Real estates are lazy & dishonest. Theres nothing i can do when i look at a property & they dont show me the garage & when i move in the owner has all there belongings in there. 
Better viewing times
More efficient and caring property managers! 
"Tighter restrictions on fire safety for property owners, especially in rural and/or remote houses."
Make it easier To break lease with a set exit fee
"A mandatory maintenance inspection by an independent body prior to the commencement of a lease to ensure a rental is 'fit to live' and the tenant does not have to live with broken promises of repair or have protracted inconvenience times when basic things are not fixed e.g. leaking taps, mouldy ceilngs, faulty powerpoints, damaged gates etc."
"Do away with routine inspections. It doesn’t feel like my home if someone can just come in at a time of their choosing (I get no say) and take pictures of where I live and my possessions. Inspections are sometimes necessary, but why not do them when there is a reason, not just routinely. And give them tenant a say in when they happen. "
"I am elderly, alone and in constant pain.
If I could have a little doggy or pussycat to love I am sure life would be brighter."
Better access to owner/agent to suggest home improvements
Fair treatment from owners and real estate when it comes to maintenance and cleaning 
Definately allowing more freedom to have pets
"That tenant's tell you immediately they think something needs attention, especially if ""stitch in time saves nine"""
"More privacy  refund of bonds 
 Less fees 
Rental payment books
"
"Property managers are, in general, ineffective youngsters with zero life or customer service skills. Make it harder to become one without a decent qualification."
"Mandatory reporting for real estate agent to the RTA for non-comlpience, of the property owner and/or body corporate, in terms of the rental property Act and lease conditions."
Have more controls on owners to fix problems that effect your living conditions.
More rights for landlords and less for tennants
Enforce my landlord to fix all issues with the house in a timely manner. Just becuase they don't deem it as urgent doesn't mean it doesnt need to be fixed. 
Ability to have things updated
How hard and difficult estate agents make it to leave a property. 
Allow small pets.
I'd love to be able to have a dog again.
"Cost, repairs fixed on time, inspections too regular and not negotiable, when moving out real estate always finds things but never says anything about them during routine inspections, treated like a second rate citizen, charges for water without explanation of charges"
The standard that some tenants keep a property.  How hard it is to move them on when they cause damage and don’t pay their rent and for the recovery of these expenses.
Better communication between tenants and property managers.
Able to have a small resue dog
To much personal information requested.
"Less time between inspections.
Being allowed pets.
Being able to decorate or paint property"
"Have my apartment feel like mine, instead of the landlord dictating what I can and can’t do, mainly about putting things on walls."
To ensure equal rights for tenants and owners
Improve the quality & skills of rental agents
"The overall quality of houses rented , like can’t rego a unroadworthy car but u can rent anything "
Not paying for water and not having inspections every 3 months
Having the option to escalate a problem so that it actually gets resolved quickly. If the owner/real estate isn’t actually getting things repaired that are broken in a timely manner there should be a way for this to be escalated quickly. We had to wait almost a year for a broken shower to be repaired and 18 months later we still have a room with a concrete floor from when the shower flooded. 
"Have leases that reflect the needs of long term / permanent tennants.  I want to stay here long term and would love to sign a 10 year lease but am constantly only able to get 1 or maybe 2 years. Some security of tennancy please; after all, this security is offered with commercial leases."
"As a renter previously feel that you as a tenant are disadvantaged as a lot off property managers provide poor or little service and favour the owner
 As a landlord am very unhappy with the property managers that we have engaged and feel that their service is poor, they employ your girls mainly who have little knowledge about property "
The way the real estate handles matenace and that they have to  tell you why they won't renew the lease.
Realestate’s not working in the best interest of the owner. RTA has limited power unless it’s a high enough reason.
Change existing culture 
The entering into and ending of a tenancy process - both are very stressful
Garden maintenance around tall trees/hedges should be included in the rental contract to ensure all tenants young and old are not risking injury climbing up ladders.
Need to be more flexible with pets. A lot of renters will still have respect for the property even if there is a pet involved. 
"Allow pets and to be able to put pictures on the walls, to install extra TV points,Air Conditioners and ceiling fans, hooks in the ceiling to hang plants."
Tenants should have to give the same notification period for vacating a property as landlords
Real estates expecting house to be cleaned better than it was at entry
"Allowing renters to (within reason) modify the property.  (Eg.  hang paintings on a wall, fix gardens, etc)"
"More freedom to make my house more like a home, for ex put up paintings, plants"
"Introduce rent controls and a cap on the amount rent can be increased by. Introduce tax on empty properties to compensate for the huge social housing waiting list and increasing number of people sleeping rough. Give tenants the rights To make small adjustments to their homes, hanging photos, building gardens, owning pets."
A system needs to be put in place to allow tenants to pay for their own repairs and deduct it from their rent if Landlords won't fix things on the property
get rid of agents 
"We have had several nightmare experiences which were all situations created by the rental agent. 
The first was where the rental agent made public complaints that were made against a violent and abusive person who was living in the gated complex we were renting in. This person then centred all of his anger on us because we were the newest renters in the complex. When we turned to the agent for assistance, we were hung out and she then said that she could do nothing to help our situation. The police were then called several times and in the end of the situation we were forced from this accomodation in fear for our lives.
The rental agent then turned around and tried to keep or bond for reasons that we challenged, when this happened she kept a record that we had breached our rental conditions which then made it harder for us to find new rental accommodation.

The second was when we rented a slightly tired house. We did this because we have two kids and we didn't want to worry too much about a brand new home. After eight months of our contract, the owner wanted to sell. We then had to continue paying full rent while also being expected to have the house perfectly clean for the weekly inspections the owner had arranged.
After two months of this we vacated the property with agreeance from the landlord. The agent then sought more than half of our bond to complete repairs to the property she alleged we had done during our ten months. Problem was that all of this damage was on the entry condition report. Nine months after we vacated, we eventually completed the two court appearances to recoup the bond.

Three main problems here. Agents do keep records illegally and then share them with other agents. These records are not meant to be used as references for renters, they are only meant to be kept as records and there are times when detrimental records are kept because of personal disagreements such as in our first problem. This personal record was them used by other agents because when applying for a new rental, we as tenants have no choice other than to give name and contact details of previous rental agents to the new agent. Renters can be harrassed and prevented from moving into new accommodation because of personal disagreements, which is not fair.

It has come to my attention that some rental agencies are using rental bond for general maintenance on wear and tear items. They are not completing entry and exit reports correctly then relying on this to profit on the bonds. Sadly most of this is being done to overseas students who have little time and knowledge to  deal with problems like this. Agents are also suggesting that if we don't comply we may receive a record against our name. This record pertains to the secret records kept by agents and passed on through direct contact due to renters being asked to provide name and contact information of previous agents.

As renters, we have no way of checking an agents performance with dealing with renters rights. There is no record at all we can access to see how an agent is going to deal with us. We MUST have access to a database that states percentages of how many tenants are taken to QCAT, VCAT (and others) and what percentages fall in the favour of the agent and the tennant. 

It could read like this. In the past year 35% of tenants were taken to QCAT and the decisions fell in favour of the agent 28% of the time. 22% of tenants took the agent to QCAT and the decisions fell in favour of the tenant 19% of the time.

Such information could then be used by tenants to decide to rent from the agent and such numbers would be an incentive for agents to do better when it comes to being fair.

Landlords have full freedom when selling their investment homes and this can be a considerable disturbance to the tenant's right of quiet enjoyment. The renter is then expected to keep the house in a clean and presentable state ready for inspections sometimes every week for weeks. This is both stressful, costly and tiresome for the renter who is still paying full rent for a home they now don't have quiet enjoyment of. I suggest that compensation in the form of reduced rent by a percentage should the landlord decide to sell up during a rental contract. I also suggest that a cleaning allowance be made to the renter or that professional cleaners be engaged by the landlord as well as gardeners to make the property suitable for sale. 

I suggest this because there is no benefit for the the renter should the landlord decide to sell during a contract, it is only a major disturbance and very likely the end of the rental contract for trh tenant forcing considerable cost should they have to move. Agents also expect the tenant to hand back the property in a better condition than they received it so as to lessen the cost of preperation for sale by the landlord."
"The bond amount, the rent amount and the notice periods for entry, the intrusive assumption some people have with people that rents"
Property managers attitudes towards renters. I don’t appreciate being treated like a second class citizen. 
to get affordable rentals for elderly people
I would have unjustly rent increases limited. Adequate reasoning would be good too (because that is what the owner wants should not be a valad reason whereas the value of the property has increased or the condition of the property has been greatly approved are acceptable reasons).
Consistency of property managers - or a notice when they do change so we know who to contact. 
Have landlords forced to fix serious issues. Eg a blocked pipe flooded the downstairs bedroom and bathroom. Later after it happened a second time the plumber told us that they had put the camera down the first time and the pipe had tree root issues. The property manager accused our children of putting items down the toilet!
Move aware from the current bond system to a cheaper bond certificate system like Snug.
less invasive inspections providing there has never been any issues
"More flexibility to allow pets

"
Bring in a Bond for pets
Pets allowed and getting problems fixed in a timely manner
I would like a policy on how tenants are to be treated with clear expectations guidelines for Tenants and Landlords. I have discovered some really obnoxious rental managers who believe they have the right to scream at their tenants
"Make it easier to rent with pets, including inside pets.  "
Make it illegal for owners to prevent tenants from keeping pets and introduce mandatory pet tenancy agreements.
Allow pets- when I moved to Qld. my children and I have to leave our long term family pets...Devastating for all of us!!!!! Could not find a rental who allowed pets.
Allowing pets in more places
The ability to change rental price during the lease agreement 
Better ability to access owners for smoother communication purposes. 
3 month inspections and inability to have pets or make improvements. Also landlords need to continue improving properties if rent automatically goes up
"Tenants should be more responsible when renting. It doesn’t take much to check a smoke alarm, yet law requires landlord must check at lease renewal even if same tenant renews. I understand landlord to check before new tenant enters, but not if existing tenant renews."
Allow an easier(less cost) method of pursuing and retrieving costs from tenants that don't pay &/or cause damage.
Landlords having more of a day over their properties. Tenants do deserve to have rights but also within reason. Owners get completely taken advantage of and the consequences are next to none when it comes to tenant damage/absconding etc. 
"Access to my ledger even if no lease is re-signed. As I understand 12 months after the lease is the maximum access time. If however no lease is resigned then as a tennant I shouldn't be penalised for not being able to confirm by ledger that payments are up to date during entire occupancy, regardless of formal lease agreement. If the 'month by month' 'lease' is in place, then a ledger should still be provided by the landlord - regardless of the length of stay also."
Thorough checks on potential tenants
Not allow Private renting and landlords managing their rental properties due to landlords claiming fraudulent insurance jobs after tenant moving out and then the landlords insurance company invoicing the tenant without investigating or evidence. Naming  Terri Sheer insurance don’t assess they just pay insurance and invoice the previous tenant without checking if it’s a fraudulent claim 
Landlords to abide by lease agreement
more rights for owners and better law enforcement. rental managers to be held accountable for their errors/ omissions and tenant/ owner relationship.
I’d have landlords forced to make necessary repairs 
"I could not improve - very satisfied. However, from my experience and having seen what some tenants do to rental properties, I feel sorry for the landlords, who I feel should have more authority than they currently have."
"Better access to information on tenants who cause malicious damage to Government or Private housing.  Presently this information appears to only be available to Real Estate Property Managers.  Information may be obtained from RTA, QCAT and Property Managers. Availability of this information will reward the good tenants and also encourage Tenants who cause detriment to improve care of property. "
Owners selling house and you have to put up with people coming through without much notice and at times that suit them not the renter
Communication and prompt response from/between property manager
Better laws to ensure rights of landlords and tennants upheld. Currently laws just put each party up against each other in long feuds.
"If the owners/ real estate agent want to keep up with the market, provide the full package. "
Companion pets allowed and affordable rent for aged pensioners
Making sure your protected as a landlord.
To be able to have your bond to be transferred from one property to another 
time frames for non payment of rent
Lack of ability to make the apartment feel like home - can’t put pictures up.
"Real estates do not care about those renting only the person who owns the place. smoke alarms not being replaced. no discussion pre-move about needing to connect gas at the property, Maintenance not being done. So many differences in practice between agents it's disgusting."
"I feel there needs to be more pressure on landlords to be held responsible for reasonable maintenance and repairs. I have had too many experiences where these have been either delayed, ignored or only completed to a bare minimum standard."
Making sure that any faults or maintenance issues are addressed in a timely fashion. 
"Have some sort of acknowledgement or compensation of going above and beyond as a tenant - eg garden improvements, basic homeowner-level maintenance"
Bond money should not be restricted to 4 x weekly rent as tenants can sacrifice bond when they have done considerably more damage than bond can cover. 
Give landlords  a greater sense of security. Most reform is biased towards the tenants.
"Rental bonds-only for damage to property. Rent money not to be taken out of bond different area of action for unpaid rent.
"
Longer tenancy agreements are necessary for housing security. 5 & 10 year leases should be the norm
Decrease rental prices and hold rental managers to account; the RTA is supposed to represent tenants as well.  
Price of rentals and real estate to have more legislations
"Better access for Real Estate companies and individuals to weed out bad renters wishing to rent a property.  Properties are a very valuable asses and there is nothing worse than having 'grubs' trash, destroy, annoy the neighbourhood and generally make a place look the worst in the street due to their unacceptable behaviour and their belief in thinking they can do what they like with another's property.  Some people need to like in tents for a time to learn how to live!!"
Stop making renters feel as if they have no rights. They pay to stay in the house. Real estate agents and owners won’t fix problems. 
"Not just one but disallow smoking / drug use inside the rented dwelling, allow small - very small pets only & have special written agreed terms over-ride state laws/regulations"
"Make the notice to leave provisions fair and equal for all tenants and landlords, e.g. currently 2 weeks for tenants v`s 2 months for landlords. They should be either 2 months each or 1 month each."
The option of rent to buy!
"It should be easier to evict tenants who are breaching their tenancy agreement, and they should be made to cover the costs of the breach (including damages, rent owed, court costs, etc.)"
"Easier policy to have pets in rental properties. Queensland has one of the highest rates of pet ownership, however only a small percentage of people in rental properties are allowed to have pets. "
"A tenant rating system based on reports from managers as to how the tenant has performed in paying rent, upkeep of the property being rented and the state it is left in."
"Estates have too much influence on the home owner and subsequently the renter. Meaning that you have to please two organisations, the owner and the estate that governs the suburb."
More oversight and recourse for tenants.
Property manager following proper compliance with time windows on entry notices as well as care around mistakes on other forms.
"The ability to garnish tenant's Centrelink account for damages, rent arrears"
"The online systems now used for paying rent (via paying portals, not direct from bank) & the online reporting of repairs * problems. We have to take photos, write a report and submit it. Then the agent forwards our request on to owner etc. They never inspect anything, and even when work is completed the tenant has to take & forward pictures to show that work is done, and that we are satisfied with work done. They seem to have no responsibility other than taking money.  "
"Lessors should not be allowed to issue early notices to terminate, with extended deadlines, just because a lease is nearing it's end and tenants have not indicated whether they are staying on for a new period.

There should also be increased education for real estate employees on tenants rights."
the ability to transfer/use your bond at the end of a tenancy for a new bond without having to wait for the original bond to be returned and finding new bond money for the new tenancy
Property managers and how they handle things that the tenants have asked to be addressed 
Better quality repair service to be honoured when requesting it.  And the allowance of pets.
agents held more accountable for managing. 
Ban pets in rental property. They are unhygienic and I refuse to make an offer for a property that has previously had pets in it
"The owner of my house changed the estate company that they use.  We were with Little, they were fantastic, treated us really well and we never had any issues.  Now, without any say, we have a different property manager that is very rude, communication is hopeless, bills for water rates etc don't come for over six months, then when I make contact to discuss this with them, 2 bills ""Magically"" are found back to back.  Inspections are all over the place.  We pay top dollar for a house in an area that we could move next door to an identical house that is $30 a week cheaper in rent and has better appliances."
The rent not increasing every year so we could stay in the one house.
Increased tenant protection and rights.  
"Making rentals more AFFORDABLE, my rental cost is at least half or 3/4's of my Pay! "
Greater screening of potential Candidates..other people viewing properties were extremely rude and disrespectful of others property
"We are good tenants, never been late with the rent, keep the property as if our own in great state of repair test every three months to the day we have an inspection because that’s what the law allows. If no issues are found why can’t it be moved to six months?"
Improved communication for requests by tenant to ensure faster time for repairs to be completed
Protection of rent . Our property in Calliope has gone from $550 pw to $150
Non-photoshopped pictures
no more conflicting advice from the RTA
making tenants accountable for their actions when renting
Give tenants more power to have fixes and replacements to be better quality and comparable to what was originally provided instead handy man patch jobs.
Better support from the real estate agents
Improved balance between tenants rights and protection of investors
more transparency from rental agent 
"More active communication between the owner,real estate and renter"
The ability to have a dog at suitable properties 
Renting more easily with pets
Harder penalties for non payment renters
Rental agent follow through on agreed maintenance matters.
"* Recourse to professional, independent, fair and empowered inspectors who can be called upon to step in and provide professional services where the property manager/agent is not able to be a fair arbiter due to commercial interests and constraints. 
* Updated legislation that is in line with modern rental law as practiced in the European Union. 
* Beyond this, the Government needs to think seriously and reflect honestly on addressing some of the underlying cultural and historic drivers that lead to tenancy disputes, or at a minimum lead to fundamental misunderstandings and disagreements in terms of the roles and responsibilities and expectations that renters and landlords alike have. The fact is that people who do not own a property, or who simply do not wish or choose not to own a property are too often regarded and treated as second-class citizens by parts of the property-owning community, and as such regarded as almost unworthy of being equal before the law. Similarly, people who rent a property are too often regarded as somehow not entitled to enjoy the same legal status as the property-owning class. Unless and until renters are regarded as equals in society and their right to pursue their freedom and happiness in the absence of owning a property regarded and respected as inalienable, renting reform efforts will ultimately fail and be meaningless. More and more people cannot afford to buy their home. This will not change unless housing affordability is tackled separately in a meaningful way. The Government will be well advised to do a thorough investigation of renting laws in the European Union, and how these compare to current legislation in Queensland if it truly wishes to understand how particularly immigrants from Europe feel cheated and short-changed by the current laws and regulations. On a simple level, this can be achieved by taking a standard rental contract from, for example, Germany and considering it next to a standard rental agreement in Queensland. "
There needs to be someone to advocate for renters.
"The real estate property managers - it’s rare to find an efficient, organised and friendly one. "
Thing's are fare both side's have rights and can get help when needed that dose not take two long to get help
"A fairness for both parties, at present when you sign a lease it is geared towards the owners and everything that they require and because the rental market is stretched there is not really a choice to negotiate fair terms or question what they put into the contract.  The real estate or owner should not be able to include gardening or maintenance for a way around checking on the property, and to come and go when they please. "
The amount of paperwork required to rent a property even though we own a home in another State.
Better communication between lease holder and real estate agents
Limit/cap the amount of rent increases with each change of lease.
"Bond needs to be larger to cover damages, cleaning and other costs associated when tenant leaves without completing tasks and agent does not do proper inspection.
Also a more thorough check list on exiting premises so that things like air cons, sprinkler systems, hot water system, termites, pests, garage auto doors and any maintenance issues etc are checked with tenant every quarterly inspection so that huge bills don't happen when things are found out too late."
being able to have a dog and/or cat as currently unable to do so because the real estate agency don't allow it. 
As an owner there should be sticker regulations around tenant payments for calling out a tradesman when they haven't changed the batteries in the remote control
Have affordable room cleaning services included in rental agreements
I believe that the bond needs to be raised as 4 weeks bond is not usually enough to cover any damages and barley covers loss of rent. 
Having more autonomy on home improvements/decor/pets
"More maintenance. 
More correspondence when requesting repairs more leniency on actual where and tear when renting and less focus on trying to force people to leave property in better or exact same condition as when lease started"
"change no cause eviction, longer rental terms (ie more than 12 months at a time), better price control (rental increases during terms), fairer terms regarding pet ownership, fairer and easier options to hang paintings (often landlords do not even allow you to hang removable hooks)"
"Government department auditing of all real estate agents, franchisees, and property managers (for licencing/certification/accreditation) for legal and contractual compliance, on at least a six monthly basis, without notice. Same as should be done with all nursing homes and child care centres, including corporate headquarters back office operations as well as branch offices. The bigger they are, the more they believe they can hide their rorting mindsets and behaviours. This sector is sick and broken."
give some responsibility to the tennant to look after the investment belonging to others. 
Improve legislation to make renting equally fair for both renters and landlords
When lease is up what is fair wear and tear
Improved access to redress when owners/property managers do not meet appropriate levels of service provision.
More laws about how agents treat tenants.
Professionalism of the Realestate companies. 
I'd make it harder for landlords to raise the rent or easier for tenants to appeal rent increases.
have a longer lease time 12 months isn't long enough once the first 12 months are up
Wouldve loved to have recieved knowledge about what is and isnt legal when it comes to renting while i was in school 
"A change I would like to see is:
 The strict adherence to the guidelines doesn't allow for personal circumstance. It stifles renters life styles and I feel that the rigidness is not warranted.
Housing should have their own maintenance team rather than contracting the work out as the contractors don't seem to care and are often shoddy. They just don't seem to really care."
"Longer-term agreements, so that tenants can consider their house as somewhere they can live for years without fear of eviction"
Make removal of unsatisfactory tenants easier
Allow pets everywhere
Eliminate the need to contract a new lease every 6 months.  Tenant still needs to give reasonable notice to vacate.  A whole new lease serves the owner and is costly and restricting to the tenant.
"Longer leases 
Owners need a valid reason to not offer a renewal "
"Bonds should be able to be transferred between properties if you have a good record and your current agent is happy with the state of your property. 
Rent should be regulated by some sort of agency
The system should be fairer for renters for example around pets on the property. "
Longer rental lease as much as a 5year or 10year lease.
"Require real estate agents to be polite to tenants. Ban ""Mum and Dad"" investors from being landlords (none of them are any good at it!). Make landlords understand that we (tenants) are paying for a service, not paying for the privilege of housesitting/caretaking for them. "
directive powers of RTA
Stop owners putting their house on the market while tenants live there.  People pay rent and shouldn’t have to put up with open homes.  Seems unfair to the renter considering they have to abide by so many other rules.
Have more insight to prospective tenants - police searches for past criminal history
Landlord to complete work that needs to be done on this 50 year old house and stop putting the rent up to ridiculous amounts.
Allowing tenants to treat the property like their own through reasonable modification. Allowing pets more often. 
Landlords accepting a pet bond or being more reasonable towards animals
landlords can advertise their own rental properties instead of going through real estate agencies
Real estates being consistent on what is fair wear and tear.
more Respect and less bullying
"Animals allowed in house.
Inspections set to suit my time. 
Ability to add photos and pictures to walls in order to make it more homey.
Fare wear and tare needs to be defined better. Expecting a person to replace carpets after years in a house, or needing to paint walls are not acceptable. We always leave a house in a better state than what we found it in. "
Stop the bullying by Caretaker Manager and Body Coporations
Being able to paint walls and hangs things on walls 
Being able to report dodgy real estates like Tica ..have a rating system for them
Retention of misbehaving tenants back to 7 years storage on databases
QCAT process for ending a fixed term agreement early- quality of submissions from the applicant and the rigorousness of the Tribunal's assessment
Bullying by bigger real estate companies. 
Having the right to say no the pets
When you renew the increase if there is one should be a CPI increase. Tennants renting a property must be accountable and the Landlord should not be disadvantaged buy unscrupulous tennants.
"Owners must maintain property to standard when the tenant moves in, & complete repairs within reasonable time."
Allowing pets in all  houses. More rights for renters.  Faster fixes for issues in rental properties 
Pet allowance. Landlords shouldn't be able to have a say as to whether you can have pets or not. At the end of the day you don't see them restricting whether you can/can't have kids so why should it be any different for pets? You should be able to live your life however you want. As long as you don't damage the house there should be no issue. 
All prospective tenants should be provided with a compliant asbestos report of the premises prior to signing any lease.
"would make it easier to kick tennet out after u give all the forms  takes too long to get a court date to kick them out  

tennets play the system too much
easy to game the system 


"
Allowing pets without approval 
Would like to be able to take action against tenants in a much swifter manner than currently.
Let the remnant have more privacy 
No photos taken every inspection 
"Longer Leases,  less frequent inspections, automatic permits for small pets, like cats or rats. "
"I would want some history on the landlord/renting agents and their history in terms of their response times to maintence, their intentions for a long or short term tenant, the history of maintence etc so I have a clearer idea of what exactly I’m walking into. The landlord knows my entire life story and I know nothing about the home or the owners ability to maintain the home. "
Leases and bonds being kept separate for each tenant
When you have a successful outcome at the tribunal regarding non payment of rent. The outcome is enforced rather than the tenant can just ignore the ruling and refuse to pay
"Make an even playing field for owners and renters in relation to 2 weeks notice and not 2 weeks for tenants and 2 months for owners. This change happened when there was a shortage of rental properties and a mining boom. It has been a long time and this situation has changed. Tenants also find this 2 month requirement for owners unsitable. Owners and agents will contact tenants 2 months before the end of a fixed agreement and request a commitment to sign a new lease or be provided a notice to leave. Owners and agents are forced into this situation, as tenants can extend the end date of a fixed lease if this does not occur, making it difficult to rent the property when an owner has no fixed exit date, Tenants usually are not prepared to make decisions 2 months before the end of a lease e.g. 6mth lease and knowing to extend on month 4. Tenants I have spoken to would prefer the 2 week notice period be returned for both owners and tenants."
The rights of landlords need to be protected.
Easier process against troublesome tenants
Being able to speak to the RTA and get the same answer from each consultant 
"More rental properties that accept pets. More opportunity to make improvements e.g. gardens, wall hangings etc."
 More communications between the agency and the owner of the property 
Stop allowing real estate so much power to black mail you. Stop the Black Listing network
Strong laws to protect owners from destructive tenants.
Give reliable renters more rights to allow for easier tenancy processes. 
Affordable rental prices
Real Estate agent attitudes towards renters
More pet friendly properties available.
Royal commission into real estate agents profiteering from tenants and get rid of the RTA waste of taxpayer money get the post office to do the refund they do a much better job
Give more powers to the RTA to stop bad practises by rental agents
"Support tenants being able to view their property as their home by having longer leases and simply the requirement to hand back the property in the condition in which it was rented, without having to get permission to hang a picture, paint a fence, etc. "
Being able to make small changes (a nail in a wall) without having to get permission
"Needs more balance. For example, at the moment notice periods are in favour of the tenant, these timelines should be the same for both parties. Discrimination is illegal and so all parts of tenancy legislation should be the same for both tenants and owners. "
Easier payment options
I would encourage landlords to offer longer leases for stability. 
Realestates only appear to return bond when you use their approved bond cleaner. Also they  take far too long to do requested maintenance.  
Being able to have a way to notify/communicate with owners when agents are not following through. 
"More availability of properties that allow pets, in particular cats"
"Longer leases. In our town, most leases are only 6 months long intitially. It can cost thousands to move only for an owner to be able to kick you out at the end of 6 months. It’s hard feeling insecure all the time. "
"You can never have a pet and rental agencies treat you like a second class citizen.
When you try to call the manager is always out and be darned if you can get a return phone call.
They set unreasonable practices and you have no recourse if you want somewhere to live it's either sign up and cop it sweet or be out on the street.
If you even hint that you might be looking for something more suitable the agencies will look for any reason to send you packing at the next lease renewal.
There is no assistance from the RTA, they simply don't care."
Ensure that people respect the property they live in and live by the rules. So checks and balances need to be in place as people simply don't do this.
I would give tenants more agency in negotiating rules about tenancy in Queensland. Currently the Tenancy Act is strongly in favour of property owners. 
"To have a cap on rental increases per year. Some years our rent was increased thirty dollars in one hit. The reason was to keep in line with other rentals.Not really far if there are no improvements on the property.More affordable rental property's need to be available to single people.A lot of properties i would not put an animal in to live, but they still want huge rents.Why should the better areas only be affordable to the rich. "
More privacy and respect for renters. 
No open houses or inspections until you are fully moved out.
The conflict of interest at the exit stage where realestate agents scrutinise tenants and unfairly target tenants who do not use professional cleaners or even worse their preferred cleaning service who could potentially be owned by the agent or the agents associates. 
streamline the RTA bond return system
"If tenants are doing the wrong thing, owners should reserve the right to kick them out. "
Allow lessors to cut water services to lessees in rent arrears beyond bond payments.
"That Landlords use registered Maintenance people ie plumbers electricians security installers. Past experience has taken my landlord  to long of a time to fix ,"
"Pet bonds to ensure a happy & safe home for pets. Too many families have to forfeit their animals or move so far away from their jobs etc to find a pet friendly home. Even then, you’re competeing against so many others seeking pet friendly homes."
Tenants have more rights when people can enter the property
"Hard to say, we had tenants damage the property and stop paying rent without any consideration. Maybe more ability to hold them accountable "
Better support from property management 
"Strengthen tenant’s rights, especially when it comes to having the house on the market "
"Owner to pay for lawn grubs
Owner not to do his own repairs and not be notified he was attending himself "
A rental rating for tenants (similar to a credit rating score) so background checks can be more transparent and available.
"Quality of real estate agents. All agents I've had have not complied with many rules (e.g. requiring you to pay bond before the signing the lease; not providing lease & terms before the meeting to sign it), and also have been generally unresponsive to communication. It's hard to take up issues since they have so much power over your tenancy, and a good rental reference is important for future properties. In my experience they have also tended to support landlords desires (e.g. removal of potplants from balcony despite mention of them on our rental application) over tenants rights. It's difficult to raise concerns without feeling like you're compromising your chances of a stable home."
The present laws are in favour of the tenant
"Housing in better state of repair/decor & insoections 6 monthly not 3 monthly with more flexibility with dates and times, not always during working hours "
"The ability to have more flexibility over what you can do with the house, within reason of course. For example, hanging photos. Should also consider great things as wear and tear particularly in the garage and the grass. In some houses, the gardens are done so cheaply so naturally weeds grow but it’s still your job to fix it when it’s been poorly constructed. "
Better communication with owners and repairs being done in a timely manner. A lot of places not allowing pets even though you are a responsible pet owner 
"Our property managers used blatant bullying techniques and lied multiple times and amended their ledger to say it had been posted when it clearly hadn't. They also delivered breaches the day before they expired claiming they had been posted and it said so on their ledger but they have never been received. Issuing breach notices days after debiting the money from my account, did an inspection after putting the letter in the mail box the same day as doing the inspection. Text and harassed for rent when they were debiting it from our account the wrong day causing an ongoing issue of bank fees and were asked multiple times ti change it. Charged a surcharge to take our rent and than didn't turn up to fix any issues or answer any phonecalls or emails if we needed anything. "
"Direct access to the owner, not working through a rental management agency that is useless."
The fact that we cannot put a single nail in the wall to make the house more 'home'.
"Change to change wall colours to neutral colour, in agreement with owner."
Tenants need more rights i walked away from my last house after i told real estate  that owners need to give me 7 days notice rather then just turning up when ever they pleased
"Even this survey is biased to renters, look at the wording!!!!"
Accountability of agents . The RTA/Qcat system no consistency 
"It’s extremely hard to get some rentals. I’ve just had to leave the Gold Coast, my home of 40yrs and move to Dalby. I separated from my husband and couldn’t afford the rents there anymore. I’m now having to drive there once a month so my son can still see his father whom lives in Northern NSW. I’d like to see the rent prices actually be affordable. "
"Long term agreements, 2+ years"
Tenants more liable for damages to the property.
Need someone to enforce dodgy property managers/ owners who systematically refuse to fix anything until a tenant actually just moves out or files a notice of remedy. Its these people who should not be allowed anywhere near the rental market!
That all real estates use the same identification point system as banks for proving your identity.  
More options and protections for low income renting in urban/suburban areas.
"Better protection for tenants on homes that do not fit the liveable criteria. Current waiting list to proceed to the Tribunal takes 5 weeks! If a home is unliveable, where is the tenant suppose to live until it goes to the Tribunal..."
"Freedom to choose my electricity, gas and internet provider."
Getting owners to do repairs and maintenance soulsnt be so hard or take so long. I went 4 months without a working dishwasher over xmas.
"More frequent and thorough inspections of property, and requirement for tenants to fix damage immediately."
More long term rental agreements and less inspections for long term tenants 
Credit for maintaining and improving property. 
"cost,and allowed to have a pet"
"Routine inspections only once or twice per year, property managers to not treat routines like exit inspections "
I believe more rentals should allow pets. In fact I believe you shouldn’t be able to deny someone housing if they have pets. Especially if there is a good previous rental history with pets. 
Reduce cost of rent
The price of rent per week.
increase amount of bond above 4 weeks rent and reduce time for issuing form 11 &12
longer term leases
Better communication from real estate agent
Make it illegal for landlords to not allow pets. I don't understand why we pay a bond for damages when we then aren't allowed to have pets. Children cause much more damage than an animal. 
"Rental prices 
Laws to safeguard tenants better 
Laws that make pet owners unable to be rejected 
The ability for a good renter to be able to safely apply to rent to own the house they live in "
Agents and qld housing be more understanding with the aged and people with a socioeconomic issue
Having more chance to get a house with kids
Some rights regarding maintenance and repairs and a third party to determine end of lease condition report
"As a landlord and tenant, I feel that there is an acceptable balance between the rights and responsibilities of both.  As a compliant and conscientious tenant, I have accessed my landlord though the property manager for permission to instal water filters, hang pictures, keep a dog on their property and request maintenance.  My tenants do the same with me.

Certainly, if the balance were to be tipped in either way, this would be cause for concern for me.  I would reconsider my home ownership in Queensland as a landlord, and even perhaps, relocate interstate.  Further, legislating where common sense ought to prevail, to my mind, is autocratic and in complete conflict with what I think of as ""Australian values"".  "
I don't like how people can come into your private home if the owner decides to rent it to someone else. The real estate shouldn't be allowed to come every 6 months and take photos of all your private spaces. We had to leave and find a new renting place in 1 months time because the owner decided to sell it. That's way to short notice and stressful to find a new place. Renting is too bloody expensive now.
The ability to be able to have a pet and hang more photos on the walls. 
Make it the rental agent responsibility to pick the person able to rent
Get the renters request for repairs attended to in at least 2 weeks.
That landlords didnt try to rip you off with your bond by automatically coming up with reasons not to give it back 
Better neighbors and better communication with real estate 
"More pet friendly houses, maintenance/repairs to be sorted quicker "
Reduce paperwork in applying.
Quality accommodation at affordable prices
Faster responses after applying for rentals & national register on good & bad renters
"Cooperative, tenant focused and respectful property managers/agents"
Don’t need to negotiate pets
Tenants and Landlords should have to provide the same amount of time for a vacation. I.e. tenants are able to only provide a couple of weeks before they move out however landlords need to provide several months if they want a tenant to vacate the property.
"This is the first time I have ever rented a property.  We have recently returned to Australia.  The arrogance of the property manager at Pro Henderson would improve my renting experience.  

We rented a fully furnished home and the tiny things she is picking over is ridiculous.  I have lost almost a 1/3 of my bond on cleaning (albeit only 7 months renting) and a weekly cleaner over the7 months as well.  for example, I thought wear and tear would be taken into account, but she is picking little stains on a lounge (2 the size of a 10 cent piece) and referring back to the owners."
"Company (registered Community Housing Provider) with contract from HPW to be my landlord be required to have ""code of conduct"" requirements per eg property occupations act ( which should be under Housing minister) , to include proper tenant engagement process ( you can mail us is not good enough, some pps illit for a tart, others low agency, difficult to speak to power etc issues) up to an incluing rep on board ... cosy CEO/board ( with no housing issues expertise req, just bizoids) arrangements , each patting other on career/ linkedin greast pole, and at risk $10 each, not recipe for better practice ... the NRSCH regulator ( who in qld as far as I can tell has done not one thing w tenant engagement themselves, despite it being a listed KPI for them,) and CHRIS reporting is a soft touch, aggregate data only, no line item reporting,  cos it was ""too onerous "" for the sector? I get that it's magic pudding for jobs, and not PS ones, ( 147 tenants, 28 staff listed in our tenant handbook! some policies up to V9, and still dubious compliance, not sure that qualifies as genuine service for fee ( = our rent, and this on top on 40+ mill state asset, that company gets for ""no consideration, still puts hand out to dept for very reasonable improvements, eg blinds on western wall: talk about having it both ways) ... I get that CHP's the way of pumping commonwealth money into qld economy, via CRA, which pub housing can't avail, but a bunch of sinecures, really? Story of the age is corporate australia, at very top, eg finance and aged care industry royal commisions, being recalcitrantly lax with governace, probity and value for customer issues,: why would anyone expect corporate-lite NFPs, with even less robust regulators, be any different? And this in sector with customer base, of low agency, (scared to say a bad word in bogus, self implemented and selectively reported tenant satisfaction surveys, lest they have what they got taken away, worst form of confirmation bias,) and no effective representation or influence on procedures policies, implementation, performance of the service they pay rent for ( in my experience, the tales i could tell). Social housing at risk of becoming next decade's or less, aged care sector, seen on 4 corners. Look at productivity commission ( i think ) data: public housing tenant satisfaction highest in qld, CHP lowest, yet 29.9% (highest) of qld CHP tenants in rental stress, ie  rent > 30% income: they take more and deliver less. There is precedent of a regulator taking action for CHP putting corporate agenda above tenant welfare: NSW made one, w >2000 clients, show cause not be deregistered. Could it happen here? Not when processes and policies, reporting, driven by ""the work is too onerous "" for CHP workforce agenda.  Short answer: contract specification and surveillance, and regulator engagement, become more effective, reliable in guaranteeing tenant rights and welfare, not just concerned with de-risking to keep businesses afloat, see language of the regulator. But it's all about jobs, right, service is ""if you're lucky""? They are the only quality assurance levers we have, in absence genuine tenant engagement. Our lives in their hands."
Give tenants more rights to own pets.
"The Drama of getting permission to put photos on wall and have internet and foxtel connected, not sue if this is the landlord or leasing agent being difficult"
Ensure more rentals were avilable for those needing it.
As long as good agents then experience works out fine
Removing contact with landlord completely and only communicate via agent
Easier process to enforce By-laws
New paint job on the walls
More flexibility with hanging pictures and less stress with finding somewhere that’s pet friendly 
Less expensive on entering and exiting an agreement. 
"The repeated need for renewing the contract, for a new fixed (lengthy) period and the constant renegotiation of the rent prices seems wasteful and is disruptive to our lives.

I much prefer the common practice in my native country (the Netherlands) where a new contract can start with a minimum term (like a half year or a year), but is just automatically renewed every month after that. This allows the occupant to terminate the contract on a (typical) 2 month notice and the lessor typically either leaves the rent the same or raises it with some legally restricted percentage on a yearly basis."
Make it easier to rent with dog and make bonds easier to pay 
No single warning followed by immediate eviction when less than 1 week ahead in the rent
"The high cost of break lease. When I lost my husband and mother, I needed to move to smaller accommodation. I advised the real estate and, even though I paid rent to the end of the lease I was hit with extra costs for ""breaking the lease"". If I had said nothing ........"
"There is no integrity in any part of the transaction, particularly when it comes to exiting a rental property. Agents flout rules, RTA is toothless and the QCAT overloaded and unfair"
Limit the amount that rent can be increased by.
There are little to no houses allowing pets throughout the Brisbane and Gold Coast areas. 
More freedom to make the home I'm paying to live in fit my needs 
Allow our family to have a pet for the children. We have been renting the same property for 5 years and have an excellent rental history yet our landlord will not allow pets. The carpets in the house are more than 10 years old and only in the bedrooms the main part of the house is tiled. All things considered a pet will be no worse than having children. 
Ensure the properties are maintained to an acceptable standard
"Real estate being more responsive and organised at times, particularly in regards to communication and keeping us up to date, and fixing issues"
"Real estate listen when I have an issue with the house (ants, structal damage) "
Better felixibulty to break fixed term agreements. 
Property managers that did what they are suppose to do and Landlord that does the same.
Property agents I have dealt with in the past have proven to be dishonest. They didn’t work in the best interests of owner. 
Allow bond transfers from properties
There is more than one thing to be changed. Renters need more rights and to pay less in moving out charges.
"Stop the landlord from accompanying tradespeople and the realestate, she gives her instruction and it feels like an intrusion. "
Able to hang pictures on walls
Cheaper weekly rent.
Happy. Much better than Victoria 
Property managers need to be monitored and controlled by a governing body. 
I don't believe owners should be able to sell houses with a tenant living there unless mutually agreed. I was in a situation where the house I was living in went up for sale 3 months into a 12 month lease and remained on the marked for 9 months with people constantly coming for open homes and inspections. Owners should have to wait until the end of lease or explain their plans to tenants before the lease is signed 
Greater penalties for land Lords who do not maintain their properties
Inspections less frequently if a proven quality renter. Allow pets.  Allow wall hangings and improvements to properties 
Option for longer term leases than 12 months 
There's always the fear around what is covered and not covered when it comes to the bond on exit. Seems like it's up to the discretion of the owner/manager and not set in any strict rules.
Affordable prices available.
Easy and smooth procedure of leaving home at the end of lease.
The ridiculous hoops we have to jump through as a tenant to get bond refunds. We are totalling at the mercy of the landlord who appear to make it as difficult as possible with completely unreasonable demands
I’d change the maintenance process so that problems are fixed more quickly. 
Not all real estate agents advise whether you are successful or unsuccessful in your application after the time you take to submit it. I find this disrespectful and unprofessional.
Owner to hang hooks on walls to allow tenants to hang pictures.
"Rights for tenants. RTA Qld to look into letting agents that have higher than usual percentages of QCAT disagreements, slower than usual to lodge bonds, more bond claims than is the norm."
Availability of suitable housing 
Inspection reports should be an online form that encourages images to be attached to each room and each section. Read only access after submitting to check for damage but not make amendments 
"Security
Being appreciated for the work you do and not judged on the little things"
Agent competency with managing their various systems for payment and communications 
Equality of notice requirements 
Property managers being approachable. 
Not to be pushed into using online rental payments 
That repairs get done
Make utility bills more simplified when renting and a 30 Day Cooling off period if the renter moves in and finds that property is not in fact in the condition it was stated.
Improving the outdated kitchen to a modern kitchen.
Having property agents that could be held accountable for bad service
less frequent inspections when it is evident that tenants are looking after property
Allowing pets for long term rentals
"Real Estates attitude to renters my experience: not turning up to scheduled viewings appointments, unlawful entry when selling a property where I had a lease agreement to show a prospective buyer (no notice of entry received), long response times to repairs requests - e.g. leaking underground pipe that actually streamed water down the footpath took multiple phone calls and emails to finally get looked at - 2 weeks!"
"To ask someone to sign a 12 month lease then 1 week later announce the house is now for sale it is unfair, there should be full disclosure. 

You now have to deal with a situation you never sighed up for and there is no way out.

If a public company failed to disclose key information they investigated by ASIC.

As a tennant I feel like a second  class citizen."
Less stigma on people with children 
"Cheaper rent, more choices as a tenant"
Longer term e.g. 2 or even 3 years
"More affordable prices, allow pets in every rental, encourage owners to renovate before renting out by subsidising costs, require a standard across all real estate agencies regarding inspection intervals, cleanliness, deposits etc"
More engaged agents working for renters 
Rules are heavily biased towards tenants rights. More protections for landlords.
Less inspections. Once every three months is invasive.
Property managers had more respect for their tenants
"Inspections- every inspection ive ever had ive had to take the day off work because they are unwilling to change the date.  Having set dates or more flexibility on the tenants side.

Yard work should be kept to just mowing the yard. And keeping the yard clean."
More long term rental properties with lees inspections 
Rental inspection are handed out to a company who has a different person each time to do property inspections. I personally do not like this practice as I don’t care for individuals I don’t know coming through. The property manager should be doing this as part of their job. 
No restrictions on if pets are allowed
Strict guidelines regarding possible rent increases.
"Longer leases: two years or, better, five years. "
Being able to have a pet no matter where I go. It has been a huge barrier to get a house in an area I want to live in the past
Not having the 3 months house checks when you've proved to be a good tenant.
Stop increasing rent
"More rights for the tenant to actually enjoy and live peacefully in the rental property without fear of over rent increases, inspections or losing bond over trivially things. "
More homes to allow dogs and cats 
When a property is newly built and there is something that the property needs the owner refuses to do something and expects the tenant to pay for it. The real estate doesn’t do anything about it either
"Make real estate agents accountable to tenants as well as landlords - at the moment, landlords pay their way so they look after their interests. When I ask for the property I’m renting to be maintained I’m told ‘I’m only renting’, yet when the property is inspected I’m told I’m to look after it as if it’s my own. I’ve always owned property and the conditions I’m forced to put up with as a tenant are just not good enough."
"Ability to change some of the rental restrictions E.g., pets, wall-mountings etc."
Improved quality of properties and availability of housing for pet owners. My dogs are my children and are quieter and less destructive than human children yet there is negative bias. 
"Flexibility with Animals, and real estates. "
The time a realestate has to make repairs to a property 
Property managers need to follow through with maitance requests
"Landlords aren't accountable for maintenance requests. It can take a long time to get them approved, or they have to be resubmitted if the property changes managers or even management companies. The tenant often suffers when there is a change of management, I've had to resubmit proof of bond documents and maintenance requests."
"To be able to live without the increase of rent price going up every 12 months
Display pictures"
Lower the bond for rental properties and also the waiting list for public housing is too long to wait
"There are alway issues with getting repairs done to the home having to wait weeks for things like eg the oven to get fixed, or having things like the fence break and the owners decline to get it repaired properly (eg fence blew over previous cyclone season and still has not been repaired properly) Some rental agents also has things like pest control (from ants, cockroaches to rodents) included in the rental fees but others say it is not their concern (if it is in the end influencing the structure of the property I think it is the owners responsibility to have it taken care of) "
"More control when repairs need doing... meaning we have the right to call and make arranges ourselves instead of filling in paperwork, and requesting repairs to be done.. the hoping it’s done in a timely manner. If it’s even done! "
The unrealistic demands on my 3 monthly inspection. They expect the house to be in condition of if you were moving out and had just done a bond clean.!!!!
That some (not all) tenants actually value the home they live in. They all whinge and whine about the bond but the bond goes nowhere when the damage done by some tenants has to be repaired. The quality of tenants is declining with young people not ever venturing out to clean up it water yards and with drug abuse on the rise damage to properties is definitely increasing. Landlords do not have a leg to stand on with these tenants as it costs money to get rid of them and if in arrears you never see the money. 
More house maintenance from owner
Be able to hang pictures in every room to make a rental feel more like home 
Extreme imbalance between landlords' rights (almost none) and tenants' rights (eg 10 times the notice period??) as well as the constant bias in the QCAT forum against landlords.
Ability to transfer a bond between agents/ properties 
Not to be penalised for making the property a home
"Though I have been lucky with most owners, some owners will not fully maintain their properties with regular maintenance.  I.E. replacing leaking gutters or overflowing gutters, doors that wont lock due to sifting of house, leaking taps.  Yes a lot of this is covered by a real estate agent but in some cases they don't do their job or the owners simply ignore their requests.

They should also be encouraged to place solar panels due to the increasing prices of electricity.

Rental costs are also getting out of the range that a person on a pension could afford and those people are being forced to share renting with other people and then face problems with Centrelink and having to prove they are not cohabiting together or things like electricity bills are in one persons name and the other refuses to pay their half.  Can't have the bill in both names or Centrelink deems cohabiting."
"Lessen the house prices so more people can live in higher quality rentals, have a quality star rating so it’s easy for people to see set criteria before renting out a house or buying (eg. house date, construction materials, energy efficiency, prioritise service workers like police, teachers, nurses, paramedics or firefighters. Renting is simply the step before buy a home. No Australian dream in renting or apartments. Owner must be an Australian citizen to be able to lease a renting house to secure Australia’s own people instead of selling to countless off shore businesses making it hard to get out of the renting and buying a house instead. "
"I would like the opportunity to have a much longer, permanent lease instead of only one year lease at a time."
My current unit is 19 years old. It still has the original paintwork and carpets.It needs to be freshened up 
Being allowed pets while renting 
Length of Lease even if property is sold. 
Allow a small pet in an apartment for an extra bond 
"Rental agents do not make us feel comfortable about living here. They could quite easily get us out nd someone else in, nd they know it."
Better tradespeople on the real estate agents books
"There were very limited properties that were pet-friendly in the area I needed to rent, which meant that I had to go with a property that was $100/week more than I’d budgeted for. I believe pet-owners should be able to rent any property provided they are held liable for any damages. "
Counteract space in utilise room:rooms wisely 
"Hidden contracts in rental agreements should not be allowed. I signed up with one rental agent to find out later I was required to re-sign the lease within 7 day, 3 months prior to the end of lease or I would be given a notice to leave."
Being allowed to hang pictures with proper picture books and decorate as renters can do in the UK and US
Be able to buy a house 
Being better able to make the house more homely. Weve been here for 7 years and cant put up picture frames or plant in the garden.
"It would be good to have more input from both tenants and landlords (be that owner landlords, or managing agents) on each other,  not just a form to complete, but to try and humanise the whole thing."
transparency if owner is planning to sell property while being leased before signing a lease 
Compulsory pets allowed
We are Aged Pensioners and I am a care for my wife... Renting privately but would appreciate more Govt. rental assistance as life is difficult paying such high rent which is half of our weekly pension.
I have been renting for years but trying to get chance to view houses when you work and also being given a chance at a house that suits you. 
"Communication with property managers, they need a lodgement system so you can see when/if they action a request. "
Nothing in my current rental 
"Landlord's and property managers need to be more accountable for maintenance and repairs on a property and get them fixed sooner rather than later, particularly where maintenance and repairs are a health hazard to tennants. Landlords and property managers will charge premium rent with no opportunity for rent reduction.

"
I think property managers should face higher costs before making arbitrary claims against bonds.
Being able to safely secure cabinets and shelving to the wall. Having young kids I've already had a few close calls.
Tenant should have more rights. Real Estates seem to favour the owner.
Water should be free as the price of renting is bloody ridiculous
"Being allowed to place hooks, blinds, ceiling fans (essentially anything that won’t degrade the home in any way) without having to ask permission every time. "
Renters need to be able to feel they can live in the house not a show home for inspections.
Tenants should be great with dignity and respect.
Make so Landlords keep maintenance up of there properties . 
"Change the 2 months notice a Landlord has to give as opposed to 2 weeks for a tenant. Landlords are family people as well, we are paying mortgages so more than 2 weeks notice from a tenant helps us."
Allow people to have pets
"Make it easier to have pets
Make it harder to not return the bond "
Making it easier for renters to have pets on their lease. Renters must be accountable for damage caused by pets but everyone should be allowed the opportunity to own a pet 
Better options when it comes to timefames for inspections and organising trades to complete works.
Enforce proper maintenance by owner
Being able to rent with a pet as they are in every family included as one of the family members.
"Nothing. I've been on both sides of the renting system, and am fully satisfied with both."
"If you’ve rented the same property for 10 years, you shouldn’t have to have quarterly inspections - this only happens because I’ve had 100 property managers"
Inspections every 6 months instead of 3 as it always puts me under a ridiculous amount of stress as i worry the house wont be perfect for the realestate 
Limit on amount that rent can be raised in one year to $10 per year. 
More rights for tenants to make their premises a home. 
"I am a renter and landlord. Tenants stopped paying rent and trashed my property. It has been 9 months and I still have not been compensated. I’d like to see a fairer system where a landlord can be compensated, I cannot afford to be a landlord moving forward and this will mean less rental properties and higher rent."
"Being made to feel like you are a second class citizen - treated without respect and even rudely
 - having to allow the agents to enter the home and TAKE PHOTOS during our rental"
"Make agents more liable for the condition of the property. If it doesn't meet the minimum standard as set out in the Tenancy ACT 2008 it should not be allowed to be rented.

Introduce a Government run business for inspections of rental properties (entry & exit), rather than agents doing them. Money saved by agents for less jobs can be set as a fee by this department. It will stop the lies and deceit agents do to take bond money and protect owners."
Property Managers treating renters with respect.
Easier to get repairs done. 
Challenge of getting references if you have been a home owner for 20 plus years
Being able to decorate your home to make it feel more like a home and not some else’s. 
"Easier to have pets (of all sizes) at all rentals. 
I see so many up for adoption because new rental don’t allow which is heart breaking! Also simple things like hanging pics, bond is paid for a reason and most people want to do the right thing & just make their rental feel like a home. Thanks. "
To stop renting prices going up 
Not living in a share house 
Having the freedom to do landscaping and being able to bolt down gun safes without getting approval. Also being able to child proof a house.
Make it financially bennificial for landlords to install solar
"Being able to have pets. Obviously within limits - having pets appropriate to the rental property, registered and de-sexed. "
Not be judged because im on centrelink DSP
"Make real estates more accountable for fixing issues within the house in a timely manner. Tenants can’t issue a breach notice to the real estate without copping retribution - eg. keeping bond for minor reasons, picking on issues at inspections etc
Tenants also cannot hang pictures etc without permission which means it’s not like your own home."
Its so hard to get a property there is always 30 people applying for one house the only chance you got if you know someone 
Charging for renting through a real estate to private rental . As i found renting through a real estate hard.
"Renting history available for landlords, similarly that is available to agents. This would help owner renters.
Government shouldn't give rental assistance to people with bad rental history."
Make it easier to find rental properties that allow pets
The requirement for landlords to ensure their property meets with legislative safety compliance.
Less house inspection 
More housing and units then temp living
Make Real estates more accountable with bigger fines for breaking the laws.
More effective and responsive property management. More transparency needed between owner and real estate agents.
"Higher standards for cleanliness. My current rental left the cat door open and it peed all through the carpet for months. Also, cockroaches everywhere the day we moved in."
More places to allow having pets 
Renting prices are too high 
Making owners fix/replace things like flyscreen without waiting a year.
"contracts with landlords and tenants should be respected by the courts and if their decisions cost either party, losses, they should take responsibility for compensation.
the RTA contract must be used so it must be upheld."
"The very short time frame to find and decide on a property.
Much less bureaucracy: long and complex forms, unclear process, lack of communication by agents.
All in all there seems to be a lot of ""pot-luck"" involved. "
Standard of service from real estate agents needs to be more accountable. Better consultation on rent increases with owners involved not just property managers.
"Renting industry must understand, that if Landlords do not have rights over the property they have saved, and worked for then renting in Queensland will get no better.  At present, I have seen so many houses ruined, while hardworking landlords are taken for a ride.  Tenants must have rights, but the right to ruin a house, not pay rent is not one of them. "
Realestate to be hold  accountable for some of the shit they put against the good tenets to have a black for them so thing are not one way!!!!
Not living in constant fear of eviction or constant rise in rent
Affordable living in mining towns with inflation 
"I would like to see similar reforms to the ones recently introduced to Victoria which allow for minimum living standards, longer term leases and the ability for tenants to perform small modifications to the property without permission. While my current agent has been fairly good on the whole, others have been very unprofessional and only seemed to be acting in the landlords interest rather than both."
Better communication from real estate agents
More properties allowing pets and property managers turn into the devil when you move out and do exit reports. These things they magically find need to be actressed at each inspection 
allow pets more often
Longer lease option with more security and not the constant rental increase.
"being able to have dogs, must real estates won’t let u have pets which leaves a lot of people having to get rid of their family pets leaving them heart broken and the animal shelters full"
"The cost of renting, it seems to be going up remarkably making it almost unaffordable to rent or own"
Give more rights to landlords to remove troublesome tenants 
"Security, health & safety audit, "
Time of waiting for approvals
rent pricing caps. becoming too expensive for working families to rent.
Less stress surrounding inspections and real estates 
"Give tenants more freedom over their rental property eg - the ability to do little things like hang a picture hook or get a pet. Things like this are far less destructive than, for example, having children. And yet it's okay to have kids in a rental property but not okay to get a cat. Also, this is what your bond covers, and you get that back, provided your house is kept in good condition."
Owners attending inspections at least once a year to ensure and create honesty from both agent/landlord and tenant. If private rental inspections must be accompanied by a private third party at least once a year. 
Have owners be more responsive when requested to repair a defect on their property
If you have a good record of caring for the home inspections become less frequent 
Inspection to 6mth apart not 3 
"Less inspections.
Longer lease terms.
"
Long term renting. 12 months at time provided no security or a chance to settle. 
The application process needs to be looked at 
I would like to be able to hang pictures. Plus have the option for periodic lease rather than fixed term more readily available after the first fixed term expires
If breach notices were not automatically sent if a rent payment was a day or two overdue. 
"All properties should have building inspections conducted annually or when being signed up a new managment, as some properties on the market do have items that do not pass building codes"
"As Owners we experience less authority on our properties. We invest on houses after taking loans from banks and we work hard to pay the loan, Rates, Bank fees, maintenance and everything. Every owner is not a rich person. We are just mum and dads who try to secure something for our retirement (not to stay luxury but to survive).
In Queensland, the tenants get more rights. They can stay in our properties even they do wrong things and once we sold a house because we did not have any say.
The owners should have a better say if they are not satisfy with the tenants. Some tenants do alterations to houses and they get away with it. Keep them so badly and leave them badly. The damage is most of the time more than their 4 week rental bond. 
Since the market is plenty of rental properties owners has to reduce the rent and due to this, they are not getting enough money to cover their costs.
People think it is a tax benefit, but for an average person the benefits are not that much. Therefore, owners should have more rights when the tenants are behaving bad.
Also, there should be proper rules to stop subletting. There is a huge market for students and lots of tenants sublease the houses to students. What are the rules to stop them doing. 
Having Pets should be always outside only. The damage done to inside by pets are always enormous and owners do not anticipate these sort of repairs. Their should be proper rules for pets.

"
"The laws are completely in favour of the landlord. I have to ask for permission to even put picture hooks up in my home. If I haven’t then at the constant inspections, which are a huge intrusion, I could get in trouble "
Have more information provided to first time renters
Tougher penalties when landlords break the rules. At the moment the only thing that happens is the RTA educates them. Like when my landlord entered my property wothout entry notice the rta only educated them but not penalized them.
Changes to allow a pet and improved maintenance requirements.
Reduce the difficulty of finding pet friendly rentals. Increase the responsiveness regarding maintenance and fixes. Allow small customisation such as wall hangings
Flexible inspection times
The ability to make more decisions myself such as hanging pictures and doing any minor repairs myself.
"Enable Landlords to recover money from delinquent tenants. Currently, all we can recover is the bond in most cases. Defaulting tenants (almost invariably on Centrelink benefits) know they can get away scot-free with leaving thousands of dollars of damage behind (sometimes tens of thousands of dollars) as it is too expensive to pursue them (and usually fruitless anyway) through the courts. (A QCAT judment means nothing, as it is not enforecable unless you then take it to the Magistrate's Court). As per the SPER system, tenancy defaults should be able to be lodged with the Justice Department, with tenants unable to (for example) renew their Driver Licence unless they have entered into a repayment agreement - and are sticking to it."
Ensire that each time the rent price is increased os that it goes back into the upkeep of the house so conditions are maintained to high standards
Making it easier to get a house where digs are allowed. Council laws should be followed instead of landlords preference
Cheaper rent and quality rental houses/units
"There are MANY but if you want it narrowed down to one thing (which seems redundant) then I don't agree with having to pay to pay rent. That is agents using third parties to manage rental payments and as a tenant, I'm required to pay to use these services - being the ONLY convenient and practical option provided. "
Better communication between landlord/agent to tenant
"Bring rental expenses down: Having a carpet cleaner come in after leaving, paying for water, having to make rental place ""perfect"" after leaving. I have lived in other countries and as long as you left the rental clean they would bring in cleaners at the home owners expense to finish all the fine details."
"Allowing pets as compulsory. In my experience, young children cause more property damage - and that is what bond is if the tenant does not fix it. 
Animals are an essential part of peoples lives. I am now in a position, with my place being sold that I need to find a place for my daughter and dog and it is proving impossible - or ridiculously expensive. Terrifying actually as I could not get rid  of our family member of 14 years!"
More freedom to help maintain the property.
The cost of rent is out of control. I am a single mum of a 2 year old and the rent for a 2 bedroom house or unit is more then 70% of my weekly income
Put the RENT CHEAPER! we pay $350 aweek! How are us young ones ment to live and Save! 
"Declaration of asbestos, and whether there is insulation in buildings."
Perfect rental payment record should allow to buy a home without a deposit. 
Not being treated like a second class citizen
Tenants are treated like second class citizens. Tenants should be treated like home owners when it comes to right and responsibilities 
The way real estate agents treat tenants
Being able to hang pictures on the wall

Rent prices are too expensive 
"Allow animals at the property, including inside the house without requiring permission due to the benefits a pet companion can have on a person or families mental health. "
Ability to LIVE and make it A HOME. this would mean we signed longer term leases. Being about to put up pictures and improve gardens or plants. 
"Maintenance standards, physical security standards for cheap insurance and piece of mind plus access to solar electricity "
I would like to personalise the house more with pictures etc on walls.
Tennants have more rights than owners especially when requesting them to vacate
The process of viewing properties.
"Landlords being held accountable for reasonable maintainence of home interior, in terms of redecorating replacing old taps etc, and also fairer terms for renters needing to break lease due to unsatisfactory conditions other than those stipulated by the RTA."
Dogs allowed in all properties and also every house that's up for rent should have an internet line already available 
Improve rights for pet ownership un rentals
Don't expect tenants to decide whether to renew lease agreement or not three months from lease expiring. That is totally unfair as it depends entirely on circumstances and it's pressurising tenants to make a decision before they are ready to.
More rights for tenants when the landlord chooses to make the living situation awful. We got told there was basically nothing we could do short of taking them to court and our house was basically unlivable.
The acceptance of pets in houses.
Price. Far too expensive.
In our case we are only inspected by the owners once a year but we have the availability to report & have action taken on anything wrong or to be done. Perhaps a twice yearly inspection would be more beneficial.
"A single location where tenants who have acted inappropriately can be listed. Recording of tenants who damage prperty, or are an issue for some other reason, is confusing  - at least to me as a landlord."
Availability of more pet friendly housing
Nothing - completely satisfied 
Property owners should have a registry showing wheather they are good or not so good owners. Wheather they fix things or not. Like tenants have.
Cheaper renting options for singles 
Rent increases beyond market value
Better online services for landlords to handle compliance.
Inspection frequency and Bond Returns
access to homeowner as agents do not send information through to owners at times and other times are very lethargic in doing so
That every person renting a house has the freedom to purchase pets without getting approval from the owner/real estate agents. The requirement is just an updated form to let the real estate know what pets are there and a maximum amount of animals per property.
"Dissatisfied as there seems not to be a online system where the following can be provided as far as I'm aware - I dont currently rent but have previously and have been a landlord also previously

needs to have a statewide online system of lodgements - none of this paperwork shuffling and all landlords and tenants need to have access and monitor this as a condition of renting / business functions

The system need to capture all tenant performance history which is validated by past landlords

The system needs to be accessible from mobile app

The system needs to have access to a chat advice help line from RTA staff

The system need to be able to book in appointments with RTA staff for dispute resolution

The system needs to be able to offer all necessary information regarding renting in queensland and renters and landlords

The system needs to have a online service request ticking system where requestors can see the where there request is in the queue

RTA staff need to set the level of expectation when its comes to timelines for service requests to be addressed

The system must be able to handle urgent disputes between tenants and landlords

The system should linked to Queensland Police Service and other services for notification purposes of evictions or to centerlink etc for rent assistance matters etc

the list goes on"
A clearer definition of 'wear and tear' and not having to get permission to put in picture hooks etc.
"Short term leases, landlords ability to increase rents every 6 months.  Longer term leases should be available to good tenants."
Improve RTA based control systems to increase rental agency accountability to reward/celebrate quality agencies and their employees and public ally highlight poor performing agencies for both Tenants and Property Owners
Better value for the amount of rent I pay.
"There is never enough parking our complex has 79 town houses limited visitor parking and only parking for Tennant's is their garage no other spaces for those with two cars. Street parking has been restricted by the council. There are towaway signs at owners expense 
 on every visitor parking space the majority of the time they are empty, we pay to use the complex facilities included in our rent this should be included also "
Being able to do such things as hang photos and make the home feel more like your own
More flexibility with the lease agreement and conditions
Easier passages to escalate issues so something gets done. 
Giving notice to tenants.
"In the past renting has been great in my experience,  but I feel my last 4 years of renting has been quite negative. I think an  independant body should inspect a property prior to tennants moving in, and perhaps also once yearly to check the safety of the property. In my recent experience I live in a property with multiple safety concerns. The real estate agent and owner, push the issues aside. As a renter there is a real fear of getting a bad reference if you push for repairs. Also, affordable rentals are competative, so often things are just put up with. "
"There is too much pressure to stay in a formalised lease. The conditions for both parties remain the same on a periodical lease, so neither party is less protected, but in a periodical lease it is easier to transition properties. There is less stress on finding a good place, as opposed to taking what ever is available at the end of your lease because you can’t afford to break a lease for the right place. Periodical leases introduce that flexibility for the tenant at no cost to the landlord. So the thing I would change? Encourage periodic leasing after a fixed term. 

Also, I would make it illegal for real estate agents to charge you a fee to to pay rent *angry face* "
" I believe there needs to be more accountability put onto the real estate industry as their focus is not on preserving the landlords asset and providing appropriate due diligence. Persons usually assigned to inspections are usually junior in experience, with basic feedback to prove compliance. As a landlord this is frustrating as we can't enter the property to verify the condition and any information within reports are usually based on tenant feedback (if any). This leads to expensive costs due to property repairs that bond values do not cover. 

Also, whilst a tenant is able to live in the house and they SHOULD treat it as they own home, they still have to understand that they are not the owners and don't have the ability to do just anything they want too as there is an expectation that the property is maintained to a state that they entered the property. If a landlord provides a property in a certain state then that sets the standard to which the property should be maintained (i.e. lawns/gardens/clean external walls/driveways, bathrooms, walls). If major maintenance is required then the landlord is responsible, providing early notification is made by the tenant. Most landlords want to preserve their investment. This simple communication would make relationships better.  "
Making the application process easier
Stop rent being increased each lease renewal and regular maintenance to premises.  Reward good tenants 
"Have places as clean when I move as when I leave.
Disgusting. 
Real estates provide entry forms with full ticks in all columns for clean, working and undamaged. Put onus back on renter who never has a leg to stand on."
The property managers have always been disappointing. 
Not being judged on being a single mum.
Affordable rentals for lower income earners 
Rental increases aren't inline with CPI and exit requirements are in the landlords favour.
"A registry for rating landlords, real estate companies. House or apartment maitance log while being rented out, similar a car log book. Stronger privacy laws. "
"As a first time tenant, moving out of home for the first time into a rental was really difficult in terms of not knowing what was my responsibility vs. what was the landlord's responsibility.  I wish that the real estate agent or landlord had given us more information with just little things - what if the door handle breaks, do we replace it ourselves? Did we need a voucher for the dump? How do we replace the gas bottles? Can we plant flowers in the garden? Can we put a picture hook up? Just little things we had to keep asking and then felt bad for hassling the agent."
The amount I pay in rent
Allowing pets in rental properties.
"More options for people that are conscious pet owners and for people with disabilities.
Less rip off accomodations that cater solely for what seems over seas students that have from my experience taken over a lot of inner CBD suburbs.

"
"Feeling confident in reporting problems to the agent or owner that would make the property more comfortable to live in without feeling like the rent will be raised or you are asked to leave. For example requesting air con or fans, replacing the ancient air con and dishwasher, garage doors, guttering...."
"More places allowing pets, being allowed to hang pictures etc"
"I was tenant for may years and frequently treated as a third class citizen. I felt diminished in rights and felt only as a rent producing inconvenience.
I ma now a landlord, viwing never to make tenants feel like that. 
I believe all people have the right to live as though it is a home, whether owned or rented."
When something needs fixing it gets done regardless of its importance. I’ve had to go to the RTA on a few different occasions due to repairs not being completed after multiple requests. I had a broken dryer for over 13mths before repair and 2 leaking toilets at the same time which took the RTA to step in to have them replaced after months of requesting (no repairs or plumber came out in that time either)
Consistency in property management; internet (NBN) access 
Drop the prices on renting
Landlords and real estate not doing repairs to himes and then trying to blame tenants when exiting.  Rental prices that are way to high
"More flexability to make small changes ie put up some shelves, hang pictures, etc"
Price or rent and frequency of inspections be less
Professional single renters struggle to find reasonably priced apartments without sharing (which is usually with a stranger).
Too many inspections with one agent. Prices too high for what you get
"Not being asked to supply my tax return to confirm my income for my Community Housing provider.  
Having to give my Key LockBox combination to the provider when I bought an own the LockBox myself.   My Housing Provider has keys and can access my place at any time."
"If it’s a long term lease, i would like to be able to have pets or to be able to put stuff up on the walls. "
Each real estate agency should have and use the same rules for tenants.  
Faster response if there is maintenance to be done on our rental property 
Tenant having a say in the quality of repairs 
Realestates have more than one contractor for regular services i. e. Electricians.
Longer leases for emotional and financial stability. 
Property manager communication 
Introducing minimum stay for a tenant
making it easier for low income to found a property
"Giving good and long term tenants more rights in terms of making a house a home. I.e painting, hanging pictures. "
More pet friendly listings. 
Increased powers to deal with over controlling landlords and frivolous breaches
Have more control over what I can do in the property and to be treated by real estate agents as a human being. Every time I vacate a property the real estate attempt to keep the bond even thought the property is pristine. All my friends who are renters (second class citizens according to real estate agencies) experience the same thing.
"I have two small cats and am currently looking for a new rental property. There are significantly less pet friendly rental properties - approximately 25% of all rentals that meet my budget/location requirements are pet friendly. If property owners are concerned with damages made to their property, I am happy to pay to remediate these, but I'm not even given that as an option. My rental experience would be improved if more property owners allowed pets at their property or were at least open to discussion or negotiation on the matter.

As a second point, tenants have no ability to make changes to the property to make it feel more like a home. I realise the ramifications of making changes particularly if there is a high turnover of renters through a property in a short period of time, but if changes could be made by negotiation that would make my rental experience so much better. It would give renters more ownership of the space, and make us feel more at home despite living in someone else's space (that we pay to exist in)."
"There needs to be accountability to Property Managers to not be allowed to bully tenants.  A set standard of conduct.  An independent body where you can get help to stop the bullying.  Immediately.  Not in months time, no breeches, no, well you can move out.  These people are a law to themselves.  And its not fair to us renters. "
"Reduce Bond fee. 

Increase Bond refunds. Agents exploit the bond situation now. "
Solar would be ideal
RTA - to many times you can call two/three times to seek clarification and get completely different answers to the same question. Not enough consistency 
Stop increasing rents where it’s taking up 80% of your income 
Closer monitoring on Realestates
"Bit more freedom to make it a home instead of just a rental place. 
Availability of a longer lease without rent going up every year. "
An online reference site run by government where by law landlords/rel-estate and tenants must leave a reference regarding their experience. In other words not only do house owners/managers get to ask for a reference but also tenants can see what other tenants experiences where like. house owners/managers names are NOT withheld to be FAIR!!!!!!
"Mandatory expense reporting on non-refunded Bond expenses - proof the money went to the activity claimed.
"
More places allowing pets
Protection for the landlord when tenants renting are taking drugs or have a drug lab in house. We have experience in this and the people get off scott free while we have to pay for all damages and cleaning. Proper drug cleaning costs over $25k and they have said 1 in 4 houses are getting this way.
Rental properties must meet a safe and functional building standard.
It should be written on the front of the lease that the person who apply for Bond first is exempt from Court Cost to take it to Court if there is a dispute 98% of Tenant's do not know this as it is expensive to move Court Cost are usually let go and people lose there Bonds for a bit of dust.
Having better recourse to reclaim costs for damage and rent defaulteers
"More straight forward access to printable forms e.g. the correct type of rental agreement for different situations. Also, if you have proven your track record as a tenant, the three-monthly home inspections should decrease to six or even twelve monthly. The inspections are intrusive."
Make it more difficult for real estate agents to make unsubstantiated claims about problems with a property at the end of a lease to try to steal a tenant's bond.
Property Managers need to be held accountable for poor performance. They are given too much opportunity to really hurt tenants financially
Lease flexibility and picture hooks 
Customer service from letting agents needs improving 
"Having no choices about property inspection times and Agents being able to enter your premises under any circumstances.  if rent is all up to date and there has been no problems in the past, it shouldn't be allowed as it is and invasion of your home."
Rental agencies need to be accountable . They do not do their jobs properly
Tenants treated better with fair wear and tear
"More regulations around property management, mainly around the condition of a property and expectations on exit."
"Availability of affordable rents close to the city. I'm a single woman in my forties, it's hard to find affordable nice housing close to my work."
I would change how house rent is evaluated and calculated. What makes a house cost that much? 
"The conduct of property mangers and their inexperience and unprofessional manner in which they have control over tenants.

Code of Conduct implemented throughout Queensland (agencies and the people who work for these agencies)"
Id change the strict expectations of bind cleans from the property agents.
"1. be able to have pets. im not able to afford to buy a house even on a full time grad engineer salary. so i rent. and i cant even have a cat that does no damage.
2. getting slammed ridiculous cleaning fees. i got charges $60 from an agency once because there was 'dust on the door'  "
I've had a fair few terrible property managers who were hopeless in getting maintenance issues fixed. 
Being able to change small details of the house to make it more your home 
Less inspections they used to be twice a year now they are 4 times a year 
At present I wouldn't change anything. Rules need to be fair for both landlords and tenants.
Unpaid rent recuperated without QCAT intervention.
Power held by property manager. 
Availability of pet friendly rentals
Less inspections more trust
"I last rented 10 years ago when you would roll over to a periodic agreement after an initial 6 month agreement. This made it easy to transition to home ownership. Now, it appears to be very difficult to have a periodic agreement, forcing break lease and additional expenses for renters attempting to break into the housing market themselves. "
A better property manager
More freedom within the propery.
Make tenants more acountable.
Reduce the number of inspections if you have a good rental history
Real estate staff competence should be improved.
Decreased rental prices and not having to pay a surcharge on paying my rent.
Stricter laws for owners of buildings 
"Have the option for longer term lease greater than 12 months, eg 5 - 10 years.
Pay rent in advance rather than in arrears.
With longer term leases, having the ability to paint the internal aspects to suit family requirements. With the proviso that it is returned to a rent-able state prior to the next tenants' occupancy."
Allow long term rentals up to 10 years or more.  Rental increases capped to CPI during the term.
longer fixed term lease options. 
Communications from realestate agents and having defects fixed quickly 
Stricter laws for body corporates. More accountability for them if they break the rules.
The amount of gardening I’m expected to do
More protection for tenants who are often on the lower end of the power difference
Too many inspections per annum
Property managers tend to treat tenants as if we are children - very disrespectful of our time and privacy. 
Easier to rent with a cat
More direct communication with the property owner. Real estate agencies are so painful to deal with.
"Affordability and more or full opportunity to keep pets, instead of having to rehome them/give them up."
Owners should be accountable for houses they rent out
Better laws to help tenants against real estates and landlords when it comes to maintenance and repairs  basically servicing 
I would like to be able to own pets.
Meeting the owner of the house
Being allowed to have pets in all properties 
Capping rents.  Should able to sign a long term lease keeping the rent the same for at least 5 years.
"Stricter rules for realestates. 
Follow up with tenants, record keeping, accountability. "
"Tenants need the ability to make modifications to the property to make it feel more like a home. eg. Hanging pictures, Painting.
Rental inspections need to be reformed. New tenancies should have an inspection or two, then this needs to be greatly reduced in number for tenants with proven history.
Rental inspections need to be banned from taking photos of the property. Agents these days take photos of everything each inspection, which is essentially photos of all of the tenants personal property."
"For the RTA to provide definitive advice when there is an inquiry about rental laws rather than direct a person to the legislation which ha no answers or relevance to the query. If there are no answers, then it should be noted for future review. The RTA has to keep up with changing environments. If the RTA is to be an advisory body, it has to be helpful and make continuous improvements on the legislation. "
How the real estate deals with our issues and people should be able to have pets if they a good track record of being a good renter 
An organisation that can look after the tenant especially at end of rent term
Being able to evict tenants who are destroying my property more quickly
more safety and a balance to renter rights
Meet the owners so that they can see who is looking after their property
Need to have more say in how the apartment complex is managed. we are always told what to do but don't have a forum to express our opinions
"More affordable rent!! The cost of renting is ridiculous and won't ever allow me to save the deposit I need to buy my own home. 

Reduce fear of over zealous real estate agents looking for ridiculous reasons to exert power and control (e.g.. specks of dust in window tracks) . Mutual respect and commiin sense doesn't apply to real estate agents but it should be required to."
"More respectful and polite real estate agent property managers especially for long term, quality tenants"
Tighten up on tenants ability to be funded by Government via 3rd parties hand-outs. My experience suggests an increasing number of tenants are serial recipients of hand-outs.
"More control over the agents. Some act as bullies towards tenants with intimidation tactics.   
Example - we had a tradesman in to fix a dishwasher. He advised us the agent tells him to find something to blame tenant for the issue so they can bill the tenant. Even though it was just a age, wear and tear problem.   The agent tried to bill us for the repair and the stress you then need to go through to discuss the issue should just not happen.  In the end the agent withdrew the bill.    But we should just not have had to put up with this to start with.   Concern about raising issues with an agent is at some stage you will need to get a reference from them when moving and they can impact on your future needs."
"1.Pets to be allowed with the understanding that any damage from the pet is fix by renters 
2.a owner is only allowed to give a notice of leave with good reason and the real estate needs to also agree on this reason up lifting families for no reason is horrible 
3.owners should not be able to do there own maintenance on rental houses they can nominate who does the work but not allowed to do it themselves "
We need a free system which collect all the tenants record. It is not easy to get a tenant’s reference 
The frequency of inspections particularly if the property manager can see they are looking after the property
The cost and letting agents are too intrusive. We should earn interest too on our bond kept by the rta. Should be more pet friendly 
Real estate agents held more accountable for behaviour that violates legislation and agreements. More realistic allowances for pet ownership.
More pet friendly options 
Getting the property manager to treat us nicely. They seem to presume all tenants are bad people.
Allowing pets. Conditions of the property. Repairs and maintenance done in a timely manner
"When I first moved to Qld a number of years ago from Victoria the rental experience was very good however 3 years ago this changed.
I first rented through a real estate agent and that was very good and than I rented directly through the owner and that was fantastic
3 years ago the unit was sold and it is now managed by a Property manager. The property manager is on the south side of Brisbane and the unit is on the North side.
Wrong information provided from the start
Repairs not done and some are safety concerns - there has been a broken tile for 3 years, electricity and plumbing concerns
Rent increases
The only thing they do is regular inspections but do not follow through
Because the property management is on the other side of the city I need to be home for any access to the unit"
"Full disclosure and honesty of brokers and owners, along with massive fines levied against the same for breach."
A set of rules and regulations surrounding financial hardship for renters - decent chance to pay back arrears without fear of being asked to leave.  Like a set amount percentage of original rental price be the max amount forced to pay back.    I know some realestate force large amounts of arrears to be paid back on top of normal rent. 
Cost. Pet allowance.
"Allow Renters to withhold a percentage of rental payments or declare the Rental Tenancy Contract to be Null and Void until the Property Owner(s) completes work or repairs to essential services or dangerous situations which need to be tended to asap.
Eg: I recently waited 3 months to have the lights in the lounge room and garage fixed and the gate repaired. Had to use a ""miner's"" headlamp to read in the lounge and constantly walked into things in the garage when getting to and from my car early in the morning or at night!
Back gate would not open … the wheelie bins are behind the gate and the owner complains if the bins are left at the front of the house … WTF??????????????
We pay over $20,000 in rent per year and these people refuse to spend anything on the property. It's disgusting!
The owners are EXTREMELY QUICK to scream blue murder and threaten eviction if the rent payment is 2 days late!!!!!!!!
All rights are for Owners … that MUST CHANGE!!!
"
Short course for renters on how to look after a property
I have been renting the same property for over 14 years. Those funds could have gone along way towards owning my own home . If there was a scheme to help people to access the property market. Maybe a rent/buy scheme.
"Ensure that landlords and owners have their housing set to a standard ie hot water systems are the appropriate sizing for the house, plumbing is renewed if old, allow the tenant to actually receive the service they pay for as the rent is ridiculously high in Brisbane and we as the Tenant get what we pay for. Owners should not be the ones to commence or complete works unless they are approved, authorised and competent in building works, plumbing and electrical works. "
fair wear and tear is not always fair to the owners
Have issues attended to immediately 
Long term rental contracts 10-20years
"Having more control and recourse when tenants cause damage to property and leave owing money.   Having rented numerous properties over the years, our experience has shown that a tenant can leave a property in such a state that carpets and other fittings need to be replaced before the property is presentable to a new tenant.   
Landlords have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the property and have a lot to lose should they get a 'bad' experience in terms of repair / rectification works and loss of rent.   The existing laws do not address this adequately and any dilution would only make this worse."
More choices available Noosa region!!
I believe that property managers need to look after renters as well as the landlords 
Longer term leases greater than one year
"It should be easier to get out of the contract! At the moment I can not cancel the contract, only for severe reasons like accidents. "
Affordable rental options
That there is a balance between tenant and owner
Being considered more when it comes to tradesmen and inspection times. 
More transparency between Property Mangers/Body Corporate and tenants; more power for the tenants.
Less regular inspections for long term tenants that have a good proven track record & property managers that are nicer and more understanding of tenants needs
Establish a good tenant identifier register: that has real benefits 
Ability to get bond back easier. Have had instances where bond is refused due to gecko poop after we have left and paid bond cleaners. 
Give property managers more authority over repairs being actioned if landlord is uncontactable and allow the rta to make a decision such as bond distribution and compensation requests instead of needing to wait for qcat hearings 
an easier way to challenge and deal with unfair rent increases
Make it more affordable. More options to have pets. Control over leases so they don't increase renting costs every renewal. 
Change requirements for bed room sizes to be bigger for new dwellings. Also required proportion of 2 and 3 bedroom appartments. Currently 3 bedrooms appartments are undersupplied which rises price for renting and buying them. There should be regulation around both issues (room size and 2-3 bedders apt proportions) since for quality of living we can't leave that just to builders since all they care is profit with just enough compliance to regulations hence necessity to define things like this is very important.
"Quicker repairs, Real estates that treat you with respect and  being able to contact owner of your rental"
Better references supplied from prospective tenants
Properly managers need to have empathy and compassion and realistic expectations 
Increased ability to have pets.
"Allow pets
More freedom to make changes/ improvements for long-term tenants"
Real estates need to be held accountable for the theft pertaining to retuning of bonds! I have been renting for 14 years now and every time they have taken money even though I have professional bond cleaners. The rental tribunal is a joke!
"To have more power to make decisions including maintenance, adding gardens, rocks, pictures/hooks to walls, and as good tenants not having our bond held as ransoms over very minor issues when there are terrible tenants out there that do terrible damage."
A real estate agent that cared about their rental cliental and were prepared to work with them for longer term leases and a generally more pleasant experience when having to deal with them. 
"An a Landlord and a renter myself, I believe renters have the right to live in the home as if it was theirs. hanging pictures, changing fixtures, having a pet all make part of it.

At the same time I believe that the landlord is entitled to peace of mind, so documentations needs to be put in place to ensure the property is returned in the same condition as in the start of the rental period - observed wear and tear obviously.

This peace of mind would need to come in form of additional security (bond) to cover for repair in the cases when the vacating tenant leaves the property in disrepair or in a lesser state than that in which the property was found in the start of the lease.

Special attention is important when pets are the subject, as not all are the same, a small cat is much different to a Labrador."
"The ability to be able to have more control where you are living. E.g. hanging pictures on walls, having pets, fixing the garden up.
Be able to negotiate rental prices.
To be able to use your rental history to buy a house "
Dealing with Real Estate agents through renting has not always been positive. I have privately rented in my last three homes and that has been a much more positive experience
Water rates should be included in rent.
Cheaper rent and fixes done to the property instead of left or tenant told to fix problem themselves eg. Upon moving in we realised old carpets were ripped up and cut up in areas we were told to glue them down we have a baby that likes to pull on stray carpet and now has to be covered so baby will stop ripping it up and choking on it
The choice of time - ie: Longer tenancy agreements
" I'd love a little more freedom to decorate the place.  Just things like hanging pictures, posters.  Being able to have pets in more places, happy to pay extra bond to cover pets if it means more landlords offer the option.  Not being charged to pay rent as well.  We do direct debit and are charged $1.65 to pay each lot of rent."
Real Estate Agents need to be more open and honest about situations occurring at the property.
Speaking up more about issues in a property 
"More affordable housing for low income people, NRAS is not really affordable, something needs to be done about government housing as well the waiting list are far to long.
also there is no crisis accommodation, for someone who has to break lease and move out due to high rent is more than likely to become homeless. 
real estates need to look at everyone as potential renters and not to just look at them as they are unemployed or have no credit history so they find it difficult to get housing."
I'd prefer the owner was obliged to maintain the property to a higher standard
The skill level of property managers. They are generally ignorant and incompetent
Happy with my renting experiences
Allow tenants to do more with the house in terms of making it like their own
More understanding property managers
When leaving a property more awareness in exit report for general wear 
Flexible inspections! Most people work and I was constantly finding places I liked but could never inspect.
"Better enforcement of time frames for when repairs need to be resolved. 
More flexibility with been able to personalize rental premises like being able to hang pictures or make improvements with the approval of the owner.  
Permission to have a pet regardless of the type of premises. "
"for me personally there is not much i would change, my landlord is good & the real estate agency are very reasonable"
"More rights as tenants. Someone is dictating how I can live in what is meant to be my own home. They can tell me if I can't have pets, if I can't hang a picture, if they think I'm being too messy. It's not a home, it's like being a child again."
"The agents need to pick up their game.
Not Putting rent up every end of lease. "
"Allowing owners to charge tenants for their water and sewerage in full, also regardless of whether units are individually metered or not. Why should the owner pay for someone else's consumption of a resource."
Rental affordability/ more housing options/social and community housing options
"More uniformity for Real Estate agents regarding the way Tennant's are treated. I feel from agent to agent, there are differences in what one must pay (eg. Water and sewerage) and in general, the way tennants are treated. "
An option system to legitimately continue renting the same house
Rents are too high. Incomes don't cover
I've rented my townhouse for over a year and it'll be good if it was compulsory for the rental agent to provide a copy of each inspection report that occur every 6 months. At the moment it is facultative and I don't really have any written trace that the agent is happy with how the property is being looked after. 
Reduce the quarterly routine inspections to half yearly if the tenancy has been in place longer than 3 years with no issues recorded. 
Landlord's should have more rights about what goes on with their own property
"There should be a standard a property must reach before being allowed to rent it out.
It should not be the responsibility of the renter to fix/improve/update a rental property. 
The excessive amount of property inspections when you are an excellent tenant (every six monthly)
Rent increases for no reason and having no other options but to enter into another lengthy contract.
 
"
"Being able to have pets at any house at no extra expense, as bond is already a huge sum of money that makes moving barely affordable. It should also be mandated that renters should have their bond is returned within a month from end of the lease/moving out. It is completely unfair that our money can be held for up to 6 months afterwards with no interest or reason provided."
recognition that a tenant's house is their HOME
"The cost of moving, renting and bond are prohibitive for a lot of families and takes at least 12 months to recoup those costs"
"If a previous tenant does not get their Bond return due to damage to a property than that damage should be rectified. After living in the same rental property for six and a half years we had to move due to a landlord being ok with us making repairs but he wouldn't pay for an example air conditioning unit not working. Our current Home previous tenants have not had a bond returned because of an iron Mark to the carpet which is still there previous tenants have not had Bond returns due to holes in walls which have been so badly patched it's an embarrassment. Another example is every room in an 11 room house and vertical blinds that have no strings have broken strings can't open can't close and can't change the direction, none have been replaced. Can you property manager told us when we signed the lease that the landlord was very good. So far we have waited 7 weeks for a dishwasher to be replaced. Sorry that's more than one thing"
More pet friendly rentals
Agents comply with the legislation. 
More freedom to have my rental as my home. Such as hooks on walls 
"If you have a good renting history, less visits from property managers."
"Lowering fees for changing tenants/ transferring leases to new tenants. Owners are still getting their rent payments, the people are just changing, so the fees shouldn't be as high as they are."
"Longer rental periods - six months is absolutely inadequate.
A better attitude towards renters by agents, property managers etc."
"Longer term, fixed price leases.
Selection process for lease applications to have a set criteria.
Stricter and shorter time frames for rectification of issues."
Ways to stop tenants leaving owing money and not caring
Less expensive rental accommodations - many places are priced out of the income range of ordinary working people/people on pensions
the way we are treated by the realesate vision blackwater staff is horrible I have never interacted with people on a professional level that are so dishonest and rude
It is very hard to find a place that accepts pets such as a well behaved dog
More consideration from real estate agencies. 
Owners have increased rights to evict tenants when there is damage to the property and have a right to access the property 
"Reduce agent's bullying, intimidating ways with tenants who ultimately cannot win because agent can cause eviction or prevent lease renewal."
Making discrimination against pets illegal as I find it incredibly unfair 
The processes regarding the retrieval of outstanding monies owed.
"Better assistance with general enquiries - I've never had a real estate agent who's helpful, responsive or willing to answer any questions."
"Our real estate agent currently pictures/videos the interior if the property during inspections.
Our consent for this was never sought and when we requested it stop, we were denied.
This should be allowed only with the tenants permission and it should not be allowed to be made part of the conditions of rental."
Make ticker free or available for mum and dad landlords 
Property managers and owners should be required to act on maintenance more promptly
Increase supply. Currently there seems to be a shortage of homes available leading to high rents and in many cases inferior properties. 
Improve rights of landlords when tenants are not paying their rent and incurring expenses in excess of rental bond.
Urgent safety repairs would be fixed quickly.Repairs fixed before you move in . Repairs fixed quicker not left unfixed.
Being allowed to have a pet (dog). Requested real estate consider the option and it was denied. 
Full disclosure to tenants in regards to utility special conditions.  . I pay an extra 1000 per year in power due to a greedy landlord and dishonest real estate.  . Tenants should not pay for landlords gov rebates grabs
"Ability to have a dog in my apartment.
A clearer definition of renters obligation for house cleaning and repairs.
More transparency of bond refunds."
"Limit real estate property managers over reaching powers
 There seems to be little to no governing body for them when they abuse tennants. Going to the rto just means a tennant can get booted at the end of a lease if property are challengedas no reason has to be given or is checked."
Less restrictions placed on renting
"Pet friendly in standard rental agreement. Landlords forced to opt out.

Landlords required to show cause for refusal of pet."
Property managers have to be one of the worst people on earth. It’s outrageous how much power they have over renters. They should require at least a 6 month tafe course to become a property manager. There needs to be more help for renters in regards to repairs and other problems with property managers.
"The cost is as much, if not more, than the cost of buying a house. How are people meant to save for a house when all their money is going into rent?"
Be able to to hang a couple of pictures in living rooms. 
Long term rentals
Tenants rights need improvement. Real Estate agencies need more regulation to ensure tenants get treated fairly.
"Its too expensive. That is Australia wide, of course. But affordablity is getting ridiculous. I am buying twice as much in rent as I was 10-15 years ago, and my wages haven't changed. I get really upset that agents keep raising the rent.  "
Investigate real estate agents for ripping off renters especially with bond returns. 
More tenant rights  - it is geared way more in favour of landlords. Especially trying to get repair work done in a timely manner and paying over and above what should be paid for a rental house even when it is in a dilapidated condition. More affordable and cheaper housing for single parent families.
Reduce inspections for long term tenants and stop anyone being allowed to ban pets .
"Changing the relationship between thw real estate agent and the tenant, valuing the tenant especially when they are reliable instead of treating with suspicion"
"I want to be able to have more choice of properties that allow me to have my dog . So many properties say , ""no pets"" or ""no dogs"" and there really isn't a valid reason . Responsible pet owners make good tenants , often better than families with noisy dirty children "
Having rentals not be allowed to decline pets and have more relaxed rules around decorating the home e.g. allowing hooks etc. 
Submitting applications in competitive markets
Having hard work and improvements at my expense appreciated without having the owner increasing the rent.
Being able to have/keep pets
Inspections every 6 months not every 3
More availability of houses in general especially pet friendly ones
"Allow changes or improvements to the property like installation of shelving, tethering IKEA furniture to walls (for safety)"
More rights / say for renters
"Lower prices, less strict body corp"
I don’t feel anything needs to change.
"1. Allow more properties to have pets
2.  Owners to be accountable of property when rain leakes inside & causes dampness/ mould"
The ability to leave contracts without so much hassle when in bad situations
"More funding to RTA - whenever I've called it has largely been a hotline with pre-recorded answers.

Greater legislative support for renters. 
Often the only real remedy to a tenant where the property owner is in breach, is to break the lease without penalty. This fails to take into account the costs that are incurred for the tenant in doing so, thereby disincentivising tenants from actually enforcing their rights."
"Inspections for long term tenants feel is an invasion of privacy. 
Allowing long tern  tennant to upgrade on things that may be required "
I would like my landlady to inform me of the new rules she adds whenever we sign a renewal of the lease.
"make it easier to transfer bond between rentals. With the cost of rent each week, having to have 8 weeks rent locked up in bond is getting beyond reach. "
Give tenants more rights to act against their lessors/landlords as everything the RTA and QCAT do is protect them in every case and if the tenant says anything then they get blacklisted etc. The RTA website is misleading tenants and not informing them of their rights correctly.
Improved communication between property managers and tenants/landlords
Agents should be more flexible with the hours when they have to come to the propertyj
Reducing rental prices
Make leases longer and more permanent
"Harsher penalties / better enforcement of the tenancy agreement would help with what appears to be widespread 'taking advantage' by property managers. Having a bad property manager makes for a very demeaning and deflating experience.

In the past, especially when I was young and living in lower cost housing, property managers freely flouted the tenancy agreement without any concern for consequences. E.g. Entering without notice, taking photos without consent, hosting open houses without consent, etc."
Be able to transfer one bond to a new property 
Improved discussion and acknowledgement of issues by agents and holding agents to their obligations
I would add a policy where by the owner is to be informed when a tenant wants to renew a lease instead of the agent having the power to give no reason for not renewing a lease or evidence not given showing the owner has been contacted and they have said they no longer want to renew. (I have been living at a rental for almost 2 years and without any reason I was given a notice to leave).  The agents (Harcourts at Gumdale) have never inspected the property where I live.
"The ability to paint the walls and hang curtains, make improvements with my own money, to make the home feel like my own since I and many people my age can't afford to buy a house. Feeling like a space is never yours is a tax on mental health and it is a huge frustration to know that with the current economic climate that saving for a house in order to paint and make a space of your own is near impossible."
Lift the requirement to pay a two-week advance rent before moving into a new rental property. It should be one week instead. It's a lot of payment to make at once on the top of bond payment.
Rental prices are expensive
The rules and fees with breaking a lease. 
Allowing pets and getting things do that need doing in the place you rent.
Easier to find pet-friendly houses.
"To be able to sign a 12 Month Contract
The Body who run the complex keep it mowed and clean
Be allowed to have Animals if you wish"
Be able to make changes to the property without having to be approved for it
Better access to resources and advice when resolving issues with rental property owner
"Less house inspections, water bill to be covered by all home owners not just few selected property’s "
Be able to lodge a complaint about your Real Estate Agent
"Rental affordability, maintenance being completed, mould issues being address and fixed, security on houses"
Landlords become excruciatingly strict when leaving regarding cleaning and wear and tear. Even when some had even been there before.
Minimise the overuse of breaches  given to tenants especially for minor incidents.
The RTA operates only for tenants not for the benefit of owners or their representatives 
More respect from property managers connected to letting agents
Animal acceptance! So many places that we haven’t applied for because of no pets allowed. 
"Given the issues surrounding housing affordability, long-term renting is becoming the norm. However, renter's rights have not kept pace with the fact that rental properties are becoming people's homes. Things such as hanging pictures, having pets, and being able to settle for longer than 12 months need to be regulated. Rental property owner's rights allow them to treat renters like a commodity for their business, further exacerbating issues surrounding our over-priced property market. "
Time taken to get repairs done
Real estates kept more accountable to abide by laws
More consideration for landlords and property owners.
Better processes in place to screen out bad tenants
That the owner will let you do work on their property
Property managers are way to invasive.  They don't make it feel like your home at all.  
Lengthen the time a tenant has to give notice that they intend to leave from 2 weeks to at least one month. 
"The laws around what a Landlord can do to a property whilst it is tenanted need to be drastically changed. Renovations, repairs, improvements etc. should not be imposed on tenants without their consent. Currently a tenant can have an endless procession of tradesman visiting their abode to have work undertaken. Any changes to a property whatsoever, even minor ones such as fencing should be communicated to the tenant and if they don't agree it should create a terminating event for the tenancy. 
We had an essential piece of access removed (a side gate) when a fence was replaced without a word from the agents or landlord. They were too cheap to pay for a $400 gate. Replacement should be like for like, this needs to be stipulated in the law or landlords will cheap out. We signed the lease barely 3 weeks before this occurred and wouldn't have taken the property if the side access had already been compromised.
We've had 8 tradesmen visit the property over the last 5 months. All of the works undertaken could have been done in the span of a week between tenants. Stop landlords from tormenting their tenants and make it law for all repairs, upgrades etc. to be agreed. "
Stop agents stealing bond money.
Security - longer leases with set rents so you can make it your home.
Owners need to ensure that maintenance is done in a timely fashion in some cases we are still waiting for repairs to be done. 
"pets be more widely accepted for rental properties
Especially if there is no bad history with the pet destroying the house.
"
"1. Make court applications for rent arrears etc more efficient.
Create efficient easy to fill out forms.
"
To allow tenants to have pets in any rental property
Rules for tenant and landlord aligned between states 
Less owner inspections
"stopping owner, agent being able to enter whenever they like just by sending an email rather than asking when it would be convenient. i rent and I hate it. I also own and would not do this to my tenant other than regular inspections which are expected.  "
"More respect and privacy given to tenants. In my experience, real estate agents focus their attention on owners and there aren't enough legislation to protect tenants. The RTA is a good start."
Better communication and more opportunities to get houses 
"
Bond to actually cover damage"
My latest rental experience has actually been fantastic so far since moving here in 2016.
"That ""NO REASON"" not allowed to be used by Real Estate Agents for removing tenants.  Especially if those tenants are not in arrears with their rent.  That Real Estate Agents are checked by the RTA regularly to ensure they are maintaining correct & up-to-date rent ledgers"
All places should allow pets
"More lower cost, quality accommodation to be built - whether this be government initiated or from the private sector. The rentals are far too high for low income earners, in particular those on limited income."
Renters need a few more rights as far as property improvements and liveability. 
A more transparent process in learning why you were declined when apply for a rental. 
"More support for Landlords
Tenants have multiple services to help, Landlords, especially  private ones,  are on their own "
That Real estates actually support the tenant not just the owner 
Property Manager’s behaviour
significant difficulty removing a bad tenant - damaged property - was not at home at time arranged for inspections
Reduce the bond required.
The landlord to be fast er fixing things 
Lower the rent expense and improved maintenance
Fixing the price for long term tenants
"Agents treating one badly and not understanding enough regarding Bobd, 2 weeks in advance and previous bond cleaning. Rental inspections almost every 2 months and expecting it to look like a show house."
"Mandatory ceiling fans and airconditioning due to the nature of QLD weather, especially in summer. More affordable renting closer to the city. The price being charged for some apartments aren't justified given the condition, age and sometimes lack of room and things like aircon. Also the ability to hang things on the wall to create a homely feel."
Owner via Property Manager needs to reply quick for simple maintenance requests
"More security for renters, with longer term tennancies. Treat renters as human beings, allow them to have pets and hang pictures. People who know they can be sure to live in a property for a long term will invest their own time and moeny into the home (e.g. look after gardens, do small repairs). 

Look at tennancy laws in Germany or France. Why should Australians not have similar rights and be able to live lifes free from constant worry about loosing their home. "
"Frequency of inspections. Post 6 months, inspections only need to be 6 monthly. I also dont agree with the real estate taking photos with my possessions in the house."
Government assistance needed for single parents to help pay the high rent or rents to be halved. 
To have more options for pet friendly accommodation at reasonable prices 
"Preventing real estate agency’s from taking your bond money without reasonable cause.
ie:normal wear and tear on the property after renting there for years and years.
I think the real estate agents do this to benefit themselves rather than the landlord"
Getting landlords to action repairs/maintenance and upgrade requests promptly.
Make sure photos are taken before and after properties ar vacated
"Better agents, some agents are aggressive and treat renters like second class citizens, and try to rip off renters in not communicating correctly to the renter and landlord"
"Better protections and allowances for tenants including similar penalties for the owner when breaking lease as there are for tenants; better options for long term tenancy; being allowed more freedom in property, e.g. decorating, hanging pictures, having pets, etc.  "
Lack of care by owners or agents about the wellbeing or maintenance for their tenants 
Less frequent house inspections.
I own the place it mine they are a guest
Make provisions for genuinely long term rentals so people can gave stability for more than a single year. 
Properties should be rented in good condition. No peeling paint broken blinds or appliances & no mouldy bathrooms
"Fairer rules for landlords, more free assistance for landlords"
We are the ones that rent out.  Pretty much everytime we have rented out we have gone to great expense to bring it back to what it looked like.  We have had to replace carpet that is only a year or so old and remove rubbish and clean walls & fans etc.  Things have been left broken such as blinds and doors.  We have had alot of expense over the years.  It seems so hard to remove these type of people when they are not respecting the property.  Therefore I would make a mandatory that they pay for all damage and cleaning that is left behind.  The bond never covers the amount of damage and rubbish left.
Tenants need better screening and  totally disagree to make it easier for them to have pets and hang pictures
Less discrimantion for single mothers or families with pets
Pets automatically allowed
"Inspections every three months is to much.
Entry to property without tenant not fair for the tenant."
"Being able to speak with the unit owner at least once per year so that he/she can understand your needs, the need for any maintennace, etc"
"We have generally been very lucky with our rent experiences.  The only change I would like to see would be some honesty from owners.  We have been told on various occasions that the tenancy was long term, and after 12 months the owners have changed their minds for various reasons.  Hard to regulate I know as circumstances change.  "
"Pet allowance. It's very difficult to find a rental property with an owner who will allow pets. Renters are just like other people, and should not be denied the companionship of a pet"
Discrimination against tenants who have pets.  Evan if they have exceptional references.   
Rooming Accommodation Agreements should allow the Landlord and Tenant to reach agreement on sharing electricity and gas costs even if the room is not separately metered.
"Personally for my rental agreement, three (3) monthly inspections are an inconvenience - perhaps this could be introduced for new applications and/or rental persons, not someone who has rented for their entire life with no issues."
"Greater accountability for tenants if they damage property, don't make payments, etc."
Have more power points installed in older places at the owners expense. 
"Fairer conditions for having animals in properties, especially when you treat properties with care as if they are your own. "
"Having more say on how things are fixed eg one example from experience. 

Shower stopped working. Had been a great shower, with decent water pressure and normal hot/cold water balance. And was one on a hose, so could move around which is good after injury and helpful for cleaning the shower. 
The showerhead apparently needed fixing. They replaced it with the cheapest head possible which was just one fixed to the wall. The holes where the previous one just had some silicon roughly put over it with a wire still sticking out. 
Hot water barely works unless you don't run any cold water and there is no water pressure, it's like a trickle. 
It had taken a couple of weeks to have it fixed in the first place. So we didn't want to complain, we were relieved to have anything that midly worked. We did notify the agent what the results were, with no response. But in hindsight I wish we had pushed more but in the scheme of other issues we've spent months fighting for it just didn't feel worth it at the time. "
Fairer treatment for tenants - protection from landlords or Agents who are only interested in making money not seeing tenant as human.
Having the owner (not the real estate) coming in whilst I was at work and going thru my personal washing eg underwear.
"The time between inspections as every 3 months in ridiculous especially with a large family and what they expect on these inspections. As long as the house doesn't have severe damage they should be good enough. At my inspections they expect home to be immaculate no toys or things on floor now that's had to keep when have large family trying to tell my children especially a toddler that they can't play cause of an inspection happening is difficult. Yes we're renters but this is our home and being invaded for an inspection every 3 months in a joke. Not being allowed to make a nice garden without a written out, detailed plan to be approved is ridiculous also. Should be able to have outdoor pets for security reasons without the muck around also due to high break and enters as long as animals don't destroy the property and if they do then the real estate agent can ask them to be removed within a time period of course so the animal can be relocated to a new home. "
Make tenants more responsive for damages.
There needs to be a huge reform on landlords and renting privately or having special conditions listed properly. The RTA needs to retrain all staff to make sure they understand the laws themselves prior to answering peoples questions. 
It seems satisfactory at the moment
Educating tenants to keep the property clean and tidy. 
More freedom to make a rental property a real home 
Longer lease times with set rentals
"'- have pets allowed inside
- hang pictures
- maintenance in the contracted timeframe
- real estate to be honest - they have lost our keys and refuse to tell us"
As I rent a 2 bedroom unit. I feel a family of 4 in a 2 bedroom unit / not sound proof with 2 adults 2 kids under 5. It’s not a very good environment to be in.
"nationalise the rental stock? Unlikely, so more government rental stock would help (my housemate and i are both disabled, can't wait homeless for 10 years for a govt house, so renting in private market, paying about 40% of our income in rent). I suppose one thing that would really help would be being allowed to keep pets. We've been good tenants for 5 years, not even allowed a bloody budgie. "
Easy way to transfer bond between landlords
Ability to have pets and hang pictures 
Give tenants more rights
"Make it more like a home, be able to put up I paintings etc, waiting for permission that never comes or takes months is ridiculous. "
More tenant security - long term leases and assurances.
My rent reflects the trend in the downturn in rental costs in my area.
"Allowance for animals with ease. 
Less paperwork. "
Property Manager Attitudes!!!  There is a distinct attitude amongst property managers that tenants are sub-humans because they rent rather than being home owners. Often being spoken to like second class citizens.
Ability to hang pictures / have pets 
Being able to hang pictures properly.
"From my perspective I am unsure how I could change any part of it because I am the sort of person who treats a property as if it were my own.  I starting renting 42 years ago , moved 20 times since then. There was a period around 5 years that i lived in my own home before divorce forced me to sell and never was able to get financial support as a single mother to purchase another property. The financial cost to move and rent is crippling."
Property managers committing to genuine repairs instead of constant quotes that go nowhere and using bullying tactics to make tenants back down
The current act does not take into consideration the cost of repairing damage or rents arrears incurred by tenants
If I have to end a lease early there should be a limit to the weeks I have to pay while the property is vacant.
Being able to change it into a home. You cant put pictures on the walls even if there is lots of previous damage from owners. 
That pets wouldn’t be a thing that had to be approved for. 
"More accountability for real estate agents, more rights for long term tennants"
Long term security of tenure
Better communication between agent
Tenants should be responsible for their water usage ie. they should pay for all their water consumption.
When renting with the same real estate agent for long periods of time with 100% compliance with rent and inspections that they could be longer in between 
Rent is extremely expensive!!  Its so hard to get spproval as so many people sre competing for available rentals.
I'd like to see gov owned rentals removed from affluent areas
More pet friendly houses.
"Being able to trea5 the home as your own, put pictures up, paint, lands ape"
"The ability to rent a decent home at our budget - it seems landlords are prepared to rent anything, no matter the standard, not maintain it, take little responsibility for upkeep or safety of tenants, and rip off the bond when leaving.  
CHANGE THE QCAT leaning so tenants get a fair hearing!"
Better communication between the agents and the owners of the properties I rent.
More pet friendly apartments.
"Ban smoking in units and townhouses, as it violates a neighbour's right to a smoke-free home."
Rental contracts should expire when up not have a default continuance
Better response to requests esp maintenance 
"fewer inspections
allowed to do more to the home without having to get permission"
Longer leases to secure properties for longer terms. Tightening rent price increases.
"Being able to find a place to rent with our 38kg greyhound. He does nothing but sleep all day, but people think he would damage their houses."
More commitment from landlords in regards to not selling while lease is exisiting 
Being more free to make minor changes(not wreck) 
Rental managers need to communicate with each other better. If 1 ok’s something you shouldn’t be penalised by another at move out. 
The stigma attached to only renting
Not to stress about being kicked out.. Making option for long term renting 
repairs need to be addressed 
Have Real Estates have stricter conditions to do their jobs properly. They have all the power. 
Blacklist dodgy landlords. Bigger penalties for landlords who disturb tenants quiet enjoyment of the properties.
"When you move out, the real estate charges you a cleaning fee despite how clean you left it/even if it was dirtier when you moved in"
Consequences for damage as opposed to acceptance of fair wear and tear.
"The untouchable attitude and appalling response time from landlords to rectify faults. One of over twenty examples in the past two years alone would be taking eight weeks to fix an air-conditioner in the middle of summer, while blatantly lying to the tenant throughout the entire process with no fear of consequence."
"Clear understanding of tenant rights and reciprocal obligations of real estate agents.  There is often little or no information available to tenants and a great many things that occur over the life of a tenancy that no one can provide advice on.  Real Estate Agents themselves frequently fail to provide information to tenants (even when they are able to do so), or fail to return phone calls at all."
"Being treated like I have the basic human right to a home..... not just paying off someone elses mortgage or investment. This would include consent to having pets, more reasonable rental prices and longer term lease agreements."
To be able to live with ease within my home without worrying about my bond being taken from me or the real estate being unresonable.  
More advice as a landlord to manage our properties within the law.
Having a clean unit when moving in reported this to the agent and nothing done about it they just said sorry
"Longer lease periods.  This would keep the short term speculators out of the market and attract the type of investors who purchase commercial properties.  Short term leasing would still be available for those wishing to rent while they build or who are on short term contracts, etc. but the majority of leasing would be on fixed plus option (3 x 3, for example).  This would give stability to both parties."
Capped rent for two bedroom property at $200pw- not everyone works in the mines
Allow people to keep pets when renting.
From a past experience years ago: To make owners more accountable when it comes to repairs on the property eg: air conditioners not working.
building compliance rules need to change. it is designed for big business
To be able to hang pictures and photos - but not too many. Maybe one in each small room and a maximum of four in a small large space.
Be able to make cosmetic changes to property. e.g. hanging blinds on patios
Bond lodgement process
"Pet's should be included as part of tenancy, and without requiring the tenant to pay for pest control on exiting the lease. "
have owners that care about the house
Treatment from real estate agents. 
"I'd increase awarenes of existing protection in legislation for renters in Qld.
I would maintain funding to organisations that that support tennants."
"Maintenance and upkeep must be completed, the ""owner cant afford it"" should not be an excuse given to tenants. And tenants should not be held responsible for damage caused by lack of maintenance."
"Make inspections less frequent.  20 years ago no one did inspections and everything was fine, now it seems like the gestapo is watching our every move."
If a landlord is selling the house you are renting tenants should be allowed to break lease without any penalties. Limit the number of house inspections.
Feeling like a second grade citizen wasn't a nice experience. 
"Faster response times from Property Managers and Body Corporates to significant issues, as opposed to waiting 12 months or more for issues to be dealt with."
When repairs are necessary then the repair is carried out within a respective period of time. That is urgent repairs within 48 hours and running repairs within one calendar month. Further to this it should be necessary that one 15amp switch be fitted in garages.
better support and protection
Have more and easier communication with agent.
"Trivial bond claims for immeterial issues eg leaves in the garden, wipe mark in the sink ect"
Realestate actually responded to maintance requirement.
Better rights for good tenants. 
"Rental increases
If there is to be a rental increase then the property in question should reflect this increase by way of reasonable or substantial improvement not just an increase for sake of an increase
Inspections
They expect you to clean the house to a showroom standard as if you don’t live there this is an unrealistic and unreasonable expectation particularly if you are working full time and managing a family
Bond returns
If you don’t hire a professional bond cleaner you can forget about getting your bond returned partially or at all that’s been my experience in all my rentals and I’ve had many.
Broken amenities
I once lived in a rental property with a substantial hole in the bathroom floor it was left in that condition for nearly a year. They are quite happy to blame you for these things not so forth coming to fix them even when it’s a health and safety concern."
Personalise living spaces without having to jump through hoops.
Mandatory fixtures and fittings 
Make it easier to view properties  people must realize that we have to work and can not always make appontment during regular work time  week ends would be good if included
Mediation process is too long. 
"More security and ownership as a tenant. 
We are treated like irresponsible children in the eyes of the laws. "
"'- Repairs are clearly laid out - ie the property manager will check the water meter when a tenants says there is a leak for a year. ( Ony actioned after the owner got a $10K bill) 
- Now I have to take photes of the meter every month... I am treated liked a child - the Pm never takes a photo during vists - 
Yet I reported the leak for 12 months/ Now I am hounded to take a photo of the meter monthly "
"Stricter regulation of real estate agents. I have rented two properties - one from Ray White (fantastic), and one from a group that acted like they had absolutely no interest in providing care and consideration for tenants at all."
Qualification requirement for property managers
The time it takes to get maintenance requests completed 
Maybe some of the real estates need to improve the way they treat renters 
"Similar to Victoria I think Queensland should allow all Renters to have their own pets in the rental property. A large number of Queenslanders own pets and it becomes quite difficult to find new rental properties where the owner allows this.

I understand it provides some risk to the owner with damage to their property but that risk is the burden of the renter who then has to pay for damages if these occur. No different to if the renter had children."
Better laws to protect renters 
"Easier lease breakage for the tenant, when the owner of rental property is not being responsible for property being in working order - yet accepts high rent for property, when things in the building are not working: eg. Windows not opening. "
"after renting same unit for 4yrs and always in perfect condition, the real estate still insist on 12weekly innspections even though landlord agreed to 6 monthly"
Longer term leases without price increase 
"A framework for longer leases, "
"That maintenance issues are fixed in the proper amount of time given.
Be been waiting 18mths and still waiting????"
More protections for renters in terms of minimum standards of rentals
increase bond to 6 weeks
Increased open communication with property managers
Longer term leases for life renters with exit options should circumstances change. 
I am an owner and would like more rights on whom I choose to rent to.
"the rental situation stinks , as the renter is been treated like a 2 class person and you get not much understanding from any rental adgent at any time . there interest is lying in the owners financial contract and commission plus the 2 weeks rent for renting the property .if the value for the rental fits the rent , there is no question about it .I have been shown in my time nothing more than bulling behavior , sat has made it impossible to have a pleasant relation ship with any of them and the biggest lurk is for you to give them access to your account for rent deductionsave rental payments , they  have a field day of getting in there when ever they need money ...we have bills to pay to , is the reply , and by the way you are 4 days behind in the rent , is the reply ang has taken me  6 month to clear up .why is there not a special way to control and make save rental payments. no other industry has so many slack laws open for rental adgent to hop around in shame on you to let it happen for so long the renter has nothing and nobody to complaint to as there is nobody to listen to .
I know I will waist my time here filling your points out , but we all no there are not long  in government to change things be for they will be given a new position in some other field .

Ability to keep a pet.
Less strict pet rules and less limitations
Make owners more responsible for maintaining the property in good condition
"All rentals should allow pets without a number limitation. Once a pet has behaved badly, then that can be marked in your history but you shouldn’t be turned down for having more than one pet. "
Being able to have my pet and hang pictures of my family on the wall
Stop owners from selling their house while houses are rented. Last three houses I have rented I have had to move because of owners selling or the land being developed. All the cost was to the renter not the owner. 
Government always apply penalty to landlord and agent even for minor fault. never apply penalty to tenant.  The renting rules is in tenant's favour
"As a rooming accommodation provider, I need better support for those times when a tenant does the wrong thing."
Landlords not paying to maintain their properties
Rent should equal value of home (age and condition of rentalpropperty)
Lower cost of properties 
"Streamline the application process - each rental uses a different form, requiring different ID etc.
Have often been pressured into using direct debit services that charge what I consider ridiculous processing fees by real estates."
Periodic leases should be allowed as with Victoria. Should not be legal for agencies to decline having them after renter has been in property 12 months
Real Estate Agents attitude towards renters
"I would make rent cheaper for renters, and not add a rent increase after u move in. Have a set rental pay from move in date til move out date."
"nothing, ive got a very good landlord who i deal directly with"
"Not being able to personalise the place to my taste (painting, hanging from walls, gardens)"
"Being more informed on what it's like to live at the property - potential internet speeds, sounds levels, etc."
Owners fixing things when they’re broken and prices reflecting the buy prices. 
"Law change to make renting more like a true home (ie. Longer Tenancies, able to paint walls, stricter rules about kicking tenants out of their homes without cause. Just look and take from the example in Germany)."
A better resolution process for issues raised with Landlords 
"Less paper, more digital records"
"Stop photographing my contents!  3monthly photo’s ? even after 7 years? 
They should only photograph a fault/damage/wear n tear.  
Inspections should be only done when the tenant is home or when both parties agree.  Not forced on one designated day by real estate. 
Rent fees paid by my choice initially ( my bank transaction) but real estate wanted and forced me to change to the only option of direct debit  through their  company.   My payments were always on time and I felt very uncomfortable with being forced to change when payments were always on time.  
Hope some of these things go into your review. "
"Make it easier to continue renting in current rental property for more than one year if one is a ""good"" tenant and without unreasonable increase in rent"
More freedom to fix up things that need fixing and make properties suit the tenants style.
"More affordable, stricter rules on rate increases "
I feel as a landlord that when a tenant doesnt pay rent or mistreats a property that in our experience it has been very hard to have them evicted.
Maintenance and repairs need to be conducted quicker
"A) Stronger control over real estate agencies on quality of service - competition doesn't seem to solve long weeks of unserved tenants, information not transferred to owners properly, 15 minutes long open house method doesn't allow tenants to assess the property properly, compulsory second visit should be provided before signing contract without any cost consequences on tenants
B) Small thing but can impact large: allow tenants to use nails and dowels properly for pictures, photos, mirrors on walls - Australian rental homes are unfriendly due to empty walls without decoration
C) Current system doesn’t support solar panel installation – tenants should be able to contribute either to the owner and benefit through lower electricity bill, or there should be a larger organisation for tenants, where tenants pay deposit and/or fee, in exchange the organisation supports owners to install solar panels
D) Support tenants kicked off before their end of contract due to sold property to new owner, who want to move in, by introducing regulation to force reimbursement of costs of moving and general cleaning cost (excluding extra costs caused by negligent behaviour by the tenant)"
Treating renters as normal human beings and not criminals
Better photos for rental listings
some landlords require 1 year contracts and then for further renewal. Why can't you keep renting without a further contract?
Maintain good communications between landlord and tenant.
It should be a minimum standard that all houses in Queensland have ceiling fans in all bedrooms and living areas.
More communication between the Real Estate Agent and the tenant
Receipt issued when paying online via DEFT
The fact that we are self employed makes it harder to show a weekly income of payslips when applying for rentals. 
More time inbetween house inspections every 3 months is to close together
Pets being allowed. Costs.
"Longer contracts.
Agents not able to take all your bond."
the amount of time to have things repaired requests sorted and completed.
"Tighter regulations on houses, property owners and property managers"
Not having to apply to be approved to have pets 
"I was a pensioner aged 67 and was told that I could not rent a house without
Extra income.   I did not pass their budget test."
"Change the culture of Real Estate agents who tend to categorize prospective tenants as being low class people who will not become future property buyers and sellers.
Every agent who has treated us badly, whilst we decided to rent whilst searching for a home to buy, is now on our list of agents who will never get out our future  business."
"having more properties that accept responsible pet owners and maybe more options to have the pets inside as the shrinking lot sizes are not suitable to leave the dogs outside all the time.
also it would be good for inspections to be conducted at a time that suits both tenant and owner as to allow someone to be home as having someone walk around willy nilly taking photos is a little uneasy to have happen when no one is home.
"
Pets considered in all rentals and cleaning taking into account wear and tear
"That homes are of a livable standard.  No mold,  houses well maintained "
"Allow pets, allowing hanging of artwork "
Consistency in treatment of Entry and Exit Reports
"Make it compulsory for owners to do maintenance, especially when they keep jacking up the rent "
"Be able to have pets, our dog was part of our family and we had to give her away when we moved to qld and had to rent. Be able to hang paintings and espec photos , without our personal items and family members we dont feel its our home. We lost my husband and kids dad three yrs ago and now we cant even have his photos of him in this rental property when i pay over $20,000 a year. This makes our future as tenants very depressing."
Not happy with property at the moment
More flexibility and a simpler/speedier process in dealing and evicting tenants who are clearly not doing the right thing by the landlord / property manager.
More aircons or fans at least in places and definitely more pets allowed properties 
Tenant contribute to water
The uncertainty and lack of control about owners choosing to sell. 
Maintenance being done within a decent time frame not waiting over 6 months
Better living conditions for the amount of rent paid and better response times  and action taken from the real estate when issues are raised. 
The way tenants are treated by rental agents/managers
"Id like to have the opportunity to pay a 'pet bond' so I am able to have a small pets such as cats, birds or fish. I find renting so restricted but buying a house is out of reach for some people. 

It would be really good to know if houses we are interested in renting are investment properties looking for long term tenants or just temporary (eg. 2 years and then owner wants to move back in or sell) This would benefit families looking to stay in one area while their children attend school. Maybe this could be information displayed in rental advertisements. I would choose to rent a house I knew I had the potential to stay long term. "
better reform or service with real estate agents 
Better property managers and owners.
Being able to apply for all properties rather than pet friendly ones 
Change the rules about pets
"No fees for rent payment systems that the agent uses. The agent has chosen this rent payment service so should wear the fees, not pass them on to the renter. Seems a bit dodgy to me."
more open communication between owner of property and tenant
Getting repairs done
Being able to chose my property manager 
"Putting up pictures with proper picture hooks.
Pets being allowed more easily, especially small pets.
Repairs and maintenance being attended to promptly"
Longer term leases for lower rental cost
moving back into the city
tenents need more say Real estate agents are bullies and are because there is not enough regulation for them
More control to the tenants using the property.
It takes too long to vacate a tenant after they refuse to pay rent.
Getting landlord to fix things instead of saying mo money to fix it?
Nothing comes to mind
"Entry Report/Exit Reports and bond release need to be completed (or reviewed) by an impartial third party. Real Estates Agents are working for the property owner and will always favor their Client over Tenants - and honesty is no longer a policy employed by some Real Estate Agents. It is all too easy for a Real Estate Agent to mark something  as a bond deduction (like external window awnings not cleaned) and your only option is to agree and lose a portion of your bond, or disagree and spend months in mediation trying to resolve the issue at significant personal cost. An impartial third party would resolve this issue. "
Less frequent inspections
"Being able to make small changes in the property like adding picture hooks, painting walls, putting up shelves, etc."
Better landlord protection
Extended rental periods for those who choose them. Ie 2-5 yes giving individuals and families the sense of security in their chosen home. 
Make eviction simpler
"Make it mandatory to not discriminate against single parents.

Make it so there is only one weeks rent in advance min and max 2 weeks"
Mould and water leakage free living
Take away the hassle of bond. Every time I have to take hundreds of photos showing faults which takes hours or loos my Bond. This is just a rip off by the real estates making money.
"Confidence in the ""system"" to more fully compensate the Owner of a property, when great losses are generated as a result of the action or actions of particular tenant.

Insurance doesn't cover those losses to a far enough extent, and Insurance Companies often have enough ""wriggle-room"" in their policies to not pay up fully."
Owners should have the right not to have pets in their houses 
"As a landlord on and off for more than 20 years, I am often amazed at how the amount of rent paid by potential tenants is NO indication of how they will look after the property."
"Better regulations to protect tenants from property managers who expect homes to present as display homes during quarterly inspections, this causes anxiety for tenants, people are receiving lease breaches over beds not being made, a cup left in the sink or even not removing a single cobweb from a corner of a room, tenants should be able to feel comfortable about inspections. Property managers are increasingly forgetting that people do live in these homes and should not have to complete an exit clean prior to quarterly inspections "
Improve the wording of rules and regulations.  There are too many vague areas.
Clarity on what Real Estate is reporting
"Force landlords to maintain properties properly.
When you buy your own home after renting, it is a nightmare to get out of the rental contract mid way through and costs a fortune. Surely tenants could give reasonable notice during a contract, if you buy or have to move away. "
Recovery of all of bond when leaving rental in perfect cleanliness but rental people automatically take a fee to clean
Easier to find good rentals
"Tougher regulations:
1) not allowing owners to literally stop by/come onto property when they feel like it, even if with a reason, permission must be given first.
2) not allowing threats from renters to filter through. If a property is respectable and of a good standard when rented, tenants should not be able to push owners around with threats because they want something done that it not urgent, nor original to rental agreement condition."
"Better landlords, body corporate groups and property managers - particularly the latter.
Removal of restrictions surrounding renting with pets. The restrictions landlords are able to make on pets are regressive, and leave many pet owners with very few options for renting.
Better communication between landlords/property managers/body corporate groups and tenants."
Know why you don't get accepted for property.  
"Being able to treat the house we are living in more like a home (own pictures on walls), being able to have a pet at our own discretion and not feeling like the owner is watching our every move with drive bys. Agents need to be more accommodating with entry times for tenants too"
"Allowed pets, allowed to feel like you are living in a home be able to feel comfortable."
More pet friendly opportunities 
For some agents to stop treating renters like 2nd class citizens. More thought to be given to pet owners
"In my experience, the worst part of renting in Queensland is the difficulty in having the bond refunded at the end of the tenancy. Without only one exception, I think the agents have been obstructive and unreasonable in releasing the bond. "
Somehow provide greater balance between renters' inexperience with the rental tenancy act and agents experience
"More flexibility to make basic changes to a house (under guidelines that are set) for long term renters. I.e. hang pictures on walls,  painting "
Short term leases give insecurity.  European model much better
"I currently have quarterly inspections and I have been in same house for over 8 years I believe if I show I have been a great tenant then they should be 6 monthly or even yearly. 
I also believe any mould infestations should be treated by owner formally as very very dangerous to live with. "
Be able to pay our rent each week without being charged an additional fee to pay it 
"The owners/rental agents taking more acceptance of wear and tear over period of time. They don't appear to accept any damage and mark appearing over year or more. 

The ability to hang pictures without permission for a reasonable number.  However, the issue arised over repairing holes where pitcure hook nails have been removed.  ""Spot"" painting is not allowed and agents can require the whole wall to be be repainted which cabn require a whole room repainted."
"If i could request to have new appliance that would be great! For example : a new toilet, instead of a 20 years old toilet that is not saving water. Or a new dish washer."
Proper penalties for Landlords who don’t do the right thing!
Rules need to make it quicker to evict tenants who do not pay rent or causing damage to the property
Lower rent & being allowed to have a pet  no matter where you rent.
"A more transparent system for repairs on rental properties. 
We have lived in the same rental house for 7 years, the house is over 12 years old. It needs a new hot water system, new oven, shower screens are falling apart. We have put in requests to the current real estate agent and the previous real estate agent to fix these issues. The answer, Owners cant afford it. The hot water system is good for 15 to 25 minutes of hot per night, we have 6 people on the lease, 2 adults and 4 kids. We get 3 or 4 showers on a 4 minute timer. Some days we get 1 or 2 showers out of the hot water system. 
We tried to get another rental property. The current real estate agent gave a bad reference, so our application was turned down. Can't get this house fixed, can't move out. We have not issued a form 11 Notice to remedy breach. As we believe we will not have our lease renewed. "
more pet friendly properties
"Less intrusive inspections taking photos inside cupboards, kids bedrooms etc"
Better lease terms to provide a stable secure home for families. 
Nothing with this real estate
   more places that are animal friendly
A smoother transition from 1 tenant to another.
Cost of renting is extreme but impossible to get a deposit to buy
Real Estate Agents being a little more helpful and reasonable.
More pet friendly properties 
Making it easier to have landlords to fix problems. Being reliable tenants gives you nothing 
"Cheaper rent, allow pets."
"More should be done to follow up with rental agencies: for example, lodging bond within the correct timeframe, giving tenants information in a timely manner, responding to maintenance requests."
More ability to decorate the house as we want eg hanging pictures on the wall
Reduced frequency of inspections for long-term rentals.
The freedom to own a pet and create a home. Blanket rules make it very hard to settle into a rental long term. Some owners are great and others are far too inflexible to meet the needs of the tenants who are caring for their property
Lowering rent prices. 
Make it fairer for single parents and families.  The moment an owner hears single parent on welfare it's really hard to get a property.  
Be allowed to keep my cat
Cost and homeliness it’s hard bring restricted and not having pictures on the walls feels very clinical 
Better real estate services 
Vastly improved rights for renters.
Pets being allowed in more places
"Make the agents accountable! In the space of 9 months The list of things my agent has forgotten, ignored, pleaded ignorance to, or straight up rejected is ludicrous;
 - Agent regularly takes a week or more to respond to emails, if at all
 - Agent took about a month to clear the garden after they were absolutely sure it would be clean when we moved in
 - Agent promptly fixed the retaining wall being at ~5 degrees out
 - ... but took 8 months of ""waiting for quotes"" and ""waiting for owner's confirmation"" to replace the lawn the contractors (unavoidably) destroyed
 - Agent finally got the lawn ""fixed"" with a dodgy contractor who put about 5 squares of grass randomly around the growing weeds, and left the ""lawn"" with about half of it as dirt (our weeds are doing more good than that!!)
 - Agent took about a month to get back to us about putting a new tenant on the lease, where they declared it was a ""waste of time"" to put their name on it, and left them as an approved occupant instead
 - Agent took another month to get back to us after we basically kicked an abusive ex-housemate out, and took another month for them to get the papers (probably) sorted
 - Agent has STILL not given us a copy of the new lease, which we managed to convince (after an annoying amount of work) our newer and replacing housemates to be signed into (they preferred that 3/5 people be on the lease than ""have to print out a whole new lease"")
 - Agent sent us forms for an inspection, then failed to show up on the day they scheduled
 - Agent (coincidentally) contacted us for a last minute inspection of the exterior (post repairs) so that the owner could see where the house was; we assume it was because they forgot about the original inspection

So basically, give me a way to hold the agent accountable for their lazy behaviour and lack of giving a sh*t, and then it might be plausible for this to go well."
"As in Victoria, Queensland should get with it, as far as water charges are concerned.
Make the tenants responsible for their own water usage. This has gone on too long.
When it takes money to get a plumber to make property water efficient, we as landlords still get lopped with the water bills that many tenants are very tardy paying it beyond the due date! 
The water usage bills need to be sent to the tenants name. They need to be made responsible for payment of their water usage, not the landlords.
It's been such a sore point, for such a long time and as landlords we are out of pocket while waiting for payments to come in dribs and drabs.
It's put a sting in the investment portfolio.
Plus, comparing council rates to Victoria, they are exorbitantly high in Queensland.
And having a dual occupancy on one block of land that cannot be sub divided, meaning 2 lots of rates on one block, just because the 2 units/houses have separate meters. That's always been a deterrent to buy that type of property as an investor.
"
"Make it easier for tenants to have housemates move in after a lease has been granted. IE, sub-tenants (not listed on the lease) bond's do not require additional lodgement to the bond board, rather a file note listing entitlement to the already lodged bond for the duration of the sub-tenant's tenure. Greater scope for tenant personalisation of the home - IE hooks in walls (provided repairs are made good on vacate or hooks remain in situ)."
Maintenance actioned by real estate agents after inspection within correct timeframes
More professional and timely communication with agents
I would change that landlords can not refuse dogs and cats. 
To have greater power to evict tenants who do not do the right thing by the landlord or the property manager. The process to evict such persons should be speedier and simpler.
A general checklist of what is expected to be cleaned and maintained for general entry inspections
Automatically have the option for pets
Allow pets to be an option for all tenants.
Support for landlords to remove tenants who don’t pay rent
"I am a private property owner who rents my properties to tenants.  The one thing I would change is tenants having to pay more bond than the current 4 weeks rent.  If tenants damage the property, it costs a hell of a lot more than 4 weeks rent to fix that damage; or try to evict them to be able to fix the damage."
Ability to negotiate longer term leases which may also allow for tenants to make small adjustments to the property with conditions.
Responsibility for smoke alarms back to owners
Stop renting and buy my own place. 
Allow renters to own pets without requiring owner permission (e.g. by bond).
Certainty with a long term lease
Affordable rentals in safe areas 
"Making agents accountable for standards of responsiveness, professionalism and knowledge of what they can and can’t legally do."
"I would like to register the tenants online, rather than to the real estate agency. 
so the government would be able to see where the backpakers live"
more assistance given to owners when tenants go bac
Fans in all room in the tropic areas
I would prefer a longer lease period to give more permanency
I had to provide all my personal details just to look through a property and the agent never even got back to me.  I shouldnt need to provide so much detail to look through a property.
"After applying for a rental property, that the agent get back to the prospective renter as soon as possible. It took me 3 weeks before I received an answer from the agent after many phone calls. "
Freedom of choice at the end of a first  lease agreement to continue on a fortnightly periodic agreement or a six to twelve month agreement.. Being expected to lock into a continuing lease agreement two months prior to the end of an existing agreement  with a threat to the tenant of notice to leave if the new areement is not signed within two weeks limits freedom of choice.
"Make sure that landlords understand that maintaining the property in a reasonable standard is expected not an option.  To get a good tenant to stay requires a home to be a place where you can live without issues.
Pets must be allowed as many animals end up in refuges like 4 Paws because the owner has to make a ghastly decision to dump their pet because properties do not allow pets.  Since most people cannot afford to buy a home then they are stuck with either a dog or cat and no way of finding a house to take the whole family."
"Better communication between tenant and rental property owner, to ensure that they actually want to look after the property."
I would like more affordable renting options for older women living alone
Longer term leases
The Bond Return Process is REALLY unfair.  It is dictated by the owners AND the real estate company.  It is onerous AND holds the renter to ransom.
Tenants should be fully accountable for damage and loss of rent
Increase the limit of the  Bond to six weeks rent instead of four to account for increased costs incurred by land lord when tenant damages property.
"Allowing pets and minor modifications (picture hooks, paint etc)"
Make it easier for pet owners to find and rent properties. Make real estate agents and landlords more liable for repairing the household.
A culture of negotiation that allows renters to negotiate long term leases without 6 monthly rent increases despite an absence of an physical improvement to property.
"Have only one standard application form, that all agents must use"
Ability to have a tenant who is not paying there rent or damaging the property removed from property more easily and quickly than under current system where it can take months. 
Make it easier for people with pets to find decent accommodation  
Being treated like a customer by our agent. 
"Increased security and flexibility in renting, particularly with respect to periodic tenancies. The power seems firmly in the owner's favour, even without considering their advantageous starting point, i.e. being able to afford secure housing themselves."
Lower Council Rates for rental properties
there needs to be more privacy within my home. it is unacceptable that 24 hours notice is given for an inspection with no ability to change times and they enter and photograph my property regardless of my requests. I have no rights to privacy in my home.
Making it easier to have a pet.  Allowing bond transfer between properties rather than having to come up with two bonds.  Providing more freedom with being able to personalise your renting home ie put pictures up etc.
"Allow more freedom to personalise the property, with landlord consent"
"Get rid of 3rd party ""inspection agents"". Force estate agents to provide honest pre-lease condition reports."
i would like to see owners given the chance to charge a pet bond where pets are approved and better consultation with owners and real estate agents in relation to changes/ reforms
Landlord cannot get rid of  unwanted tenant 
Giving the tenants the opportunity to reduce rent if repairs are not carried out in a timely fashion or just more options to have recourse to force action to be taken. 
"More properties at an affordable for one person, especially on a pension"
A landlord/agent should not be allowed to stop a tenant from owning a pet.
Too expensive to rent on coast...limit rental prices for units.
Noise - modern apartment but not soundproof.  
More rights for landlords. 4 weeks bond is not enough
"Hold a Building Manager accountable for their actions when a property is managed by an outside agent.
Currently no entity, ie RTA, Fair Trading or BCCM is able to protect a tenant when that tenant's property is managed by an outside agent!!"
The Pm just take money off the owners and we seem to be the the ones always chasing them for maintainence and repairs. Requests  being forgotten. Our investment  needs repairs time to time. 
"not having to pay rent through a third party which costs me more than the rent (eg. third party - Rental Rewards for example - cost me a fee to pay the rent. Also, some real estate agencies are asking for a full written application to be submitted before they even let us have a look through the property."
Better policing of rogue rental managers and landlords.
being treated with respect and dignity by landowners and agents
More legal entitlement for owners
Not expect landlords to keep their word.
More right to make the house a home
Real estate agents
Stop smoking on balconies in multi level apartment complexes
"The owners. Very hard to contact, slow to fix anything, it took two months to fix a dishwasher in a four bedroom house. unacceptable. The agency was very slow and unresponsive also. I rented in NSW for 10 years prior to coming to Queensland the experience was leaps and bounds better for tenants. "
Can't do anything to the rental to make it a home. Like pictures on walls etc.
Ability to continue leasing without renewing a full length lease. i.e. ongoing leasing.
Lower bond and rental fees.
"The owner of the property needs to have more control over some of the Tenants actions. At this stage the Tenants seem to have all the rights. Just one example is, the Tenant vandalising the property, but still paying the rent. Two weeks notice has to be given. A lot of destruction can be done in that two weeks."
Having property managers communicate with their tenants more effectively 
Cheaper rents for single people on pension
That agents &/or property owners reward long term tenants who do the right thing by their property instead of when you ask for something to be done or can be done that you don't either get a 'no' answer or a 'yes' but the rent will have to be increased !
"Improve Rental Agencies - they are bullies, threatening and abusive. They do not have the best interest of the renter or the owner at heart, just in it for the money."
Being allowed to hang a picture and have a pet. 
Information sharing and communication with real estate
The power that Real Estates hold by having the facility to put you into the TICA database without any notification or details. It hasnt happened time but has my family and the costs involved and hoops required to jump through are ridiculous. 
"allow pets provided the property is suitable to house that pet, and for real estates to be more consistent and fair with their practices"
"Smooth transition at time of home moving, had  a lot of trouble last time we moved house from our property manager."
the timeliness of getting a job request finalised
put pathways in for people with disabilities
Trying to get people to understand that a Property Manager is not available 24/7 & that we are human beings that are also entitled to have days off.
"Less inspections, every 12 weeks for an inspection is intrusive to the tenant.
Rental property should not be able to be up for sale with a tenant in place."
"Price regulation, renting has become so expensive."
"I own in Gladstone,  there are protections in place so as the rent cannot be overly inflated to protect the tennant, however the rental income I recive has dramatically reduced to a point where it is unsustainable and has been for years, and yet there is no relief in fees, rates etc.  I had tried to invest in the future in this once boom town, now it is bust with no light at the end of the tunnel.  "
Real estates will take all your bond money without good cause - then if you don’t fight it through RTA they will not refund the unspent. I recently had $2100 taken for a $200 repair and the real estate tried to collect the entire amount. Fraudulent and unreasonable. RTA were fantastic but took a long time. 
More notice for routine visits/inspections
Having the same time frame for tenants & lessors/agents when ending a tenancy
More open and frequent communication from the landlord or their designated Real Estate agent.
It is very difficult to remove bad tenants or get rent arrears.  
A cleaner unit to move into would be lovely!
"The ability to make my house a home - hang pictures, house furbabies, etc."
Quicker response times from real Estate and landlord regarding repairs or requests 
That the courts allow damage to be paid for by tenant at no cost to Landlords
"More capacity to remove tenants that either don't pay, or knock around rental properties.  QCAT is ludicrously slow, restrictive and unweildly and by the time any orders are made, damage and lost rental exceeds waaaay beyond 4 weeks bond and those losses are generally unrecoverable."
Be able to hang pictures etc as long as lease agreement states that all holes to be repaired to a professional level at end of lease.
Decent advice and more accurate. Support the tenants
"There are many things that can be improved, the main one is consistency from the managing agent."
Give tenants more rights
Better rights for long term renters
Property inspection staff need to be aware of RTA regulations and tenant history in their property when completing inspections 
improve building quality
Amend laws to be more favourable to the landlord
"A better description or understanding of ""fair wear and tear"". Too many real estate agents expect the property to still be in brand new condition after someone has lived in it for 5+ years ."
"Managers to be more courteous to renters.
Allow pets into rentals freely."
Better access to tenant's rental history by rental property owners.
Better maintained rental properties and more pet friendly rentals
make tenants that don't pay and trash your house accountable. especially when they are in receipt of the dole and housing assistance.   I have been left out of pocket several times now and all tenants have been receing the dole and rent assistance from the government.   Make the rent come out of their money directly to the owner so they can't abscond without paying the rent and then trash the house.   Make the repair costs come out of their government subsidy/free money
Being allowed to have pets and hang pictures.
"There needs to be a level playing field and application of the rules for both parties.  Property managers need to be held accountable for providing a quality service that adheres to the RTA requirements.  QCAT needs to be adjudicated by competent personnel that take the time to review a matter before the session, and it needs to be better resourced to expedite matters.  Bond rules need to be changed to stop tenants subject to dispute accessing that money for rent monies owed leaving nothing for damages, and all of that expense falling to landlords."
Make tenants more accountable for the state of the property that they rent.
"Rewards for good tenants. Ie less inspections. 
Ability to negotiate rent."
More ability for property managers act in best interests of client both owner and tenant when things are not being done how the should be 
Stop real estates forcing you to give 3 months notice when leaving when most available properties only advertise 2 to 4 weeks in advance.
"Pets should be allowed by default, 
Hanging on pictures should be allowed and covered under returning of the property in a reasonable condition. "
Less contact/interference from the property owner 
For agents and landlords to realise that even though we are renters that we are still human beings and not just a weekly payment. We like to be treated like people who are living in a home. 
"Pets allowed by default, Allowed to make small (non-structural) changes such as putting up pictures or shelving without prior approval."
"Ray White Beaches - worst rental agency ever experienced
Communication between agency and tenant
Consistency and competence in the industry"
"The people that manage the rental properties i.e. Property Managers, Leasing Managers etc. We were treated absolutely appalling by Rental Results in Brisbane. "
"There are many things that can be done to improve the rental experience, but the most important is to give the tenant more control over how they are treated in their own home. The building etc may be owned by someone else, but it is the tenants home. "
Make it easier to have pets.
More onus on real estate agents or owners to respond to and resolve maintenance issues within a reasonable amount of time
"To have less inspections. At the moment, there are inspections every 3 months, which is unnecessary. Once a year is enough. "
"The 3 month check ins

Can we please hang art on the walls?"
"Break lease conditions, as a tenant you are tied to your lease when unfortunate circumstances arise."
The fact that it's common and acceptable in QLD for the building manager to enter your property or provide keys to your property to tradespeople when you are not home. 
"Not so many inspections, we have inspections every 16 weeks"
Rental agencies holds too much power in the balance of conflicting interests of tenants and owners.
Have an easier process to terminate a contract if tenant is sub letting or not maintaining the home. 
Review of criteria for low-income housing (Housing Commission Housing) to take into account after tax expenditures and personal circumstances. Currently people on low incomes whose gross salaries exceed the 'means test' are excluded despite their being unable to afford private rental.
Faster responses from agents when there are issues
The attitude of real estate agents
Better avenues of communication between Landlord and tenant
Pets should not have to be requested/applied for. 
"'- Be able to put up pictures (this is very normal in, for example, most European countries - painting walls and putting up artwork is NEVER an issue);
- Proper renting agreements instead of leases for a set amount of time (regulation needs to change - check out German renting law)
- Ridiculous that there are limits on how many people you can have over to your house"
"Pets allowed at any property, tenants wanting or in a long term lease get a rent reduction, if in a rental property for more than a year the inspections from the real estate only happen every 6mths."
Communication and attitude of real estate agents
the ability to transfer bond between properties 
"The current timeframes in regard to breaches re non payment of rent are too long, need an easier way to force a tennant to pay rent and on time"
Laws seem to favour the tenants and should be changed to protect the landlord from undesirables that continue to disrespect people's property.
Less racial discrimination in Real Estates. It is blatantly obvious.
The ability to remove unsatisfactory tenants quicker.
The aweful application processs and intrusion on personal information and banking.
Details surrounding an exit clean.
"Body Corporates - they are literally non existent:  they ignore the real estate agents, they ignore owners, they ignore renters.  They ignore issues that need addressing that affect all parties, they ignore good tennants who can prove they can maintain pets even when the real estate and owner are happy for the renter to have pets.  All parties are paying for a non existant, rude, ignorant, unprofessional service."
Better laws to protect Landlords from loss of rent and property damage and the ability to have losses returned and penalties enforced.
"Ease of renting with pets. 

Stricter laws regarding repairs and maintenance requirements to ensure work is done on time and without risk of losing the tenancy."
Tenants look after property properly
educate property managers on human relations. 
"The ablity to have long term leases, without continues interruptions. In other words, to have needs meant in order to function within society, as a normal person (to study full-time, work, have friends over, eat and sleep ...)"
"As a landlord I felt unprotected. My experience was that tenants could fail to pay rent and when I went through the process of (a) attempting supportive arrangements to allow them to catch up on rent and then (b) upon failing to receive asked agents to provide advice on limits and then (c) finally went to court to request eviction they were allowed to stay solely on basis of a ""commitment"" to catch up... which they then failed to do and left owing more rent than bond provided for. "
More training required for some property managers so that they understand the full extent of legislation and changes that have happened
"1.  Photos of inside of property by real estate at inspection times to be disallowed.
2.  Real estates to be more accommodating to renters once renting."
"When tenants damage, neglect reporting needed repairs or fail to pay rent there is a better system....I say this as a landlord and renter."
"1. Much longer minimum notice period for ending a tenancy without cause. At least 6 months, preferably 12.
2. More meaningful enforcement of real estate agents who act improperly - as they often do"
"Quality of the Property Managers, they may have done a course but in reality a 21 year old has no life experience or substantial experience in the property market. "
Simplified application process
PETS! It is almost impossible to rent anywhere with pets.  Even when you are an established tenant with a good history the landlord can still say no.  I would like landlords to have to accept people with pets.
"Freedom to hang pictures, get a pet, sneeze loudly without fear of being evicted after complaints from neighbours about me sneezing loudly"
Real Estate realising that people work an cannot always been there and the fact that they are not will to change the day or hours that they can come to the property as some people do not like people in the house without being there.
To have rentals based on income testing.
"We have been landlords since 1984, managing some 20 properties over that time with only one incident where one tenant needed to be evicted due to non payment of rent, and even then it was a mutually agreed separation. However, the legislation is significantly biased in favour of the tenant, and there is excessive government bureaucracy."
Most people that rent only rent because they have no other option. To own your own property is just not a reality unfortunately. Banks make the process extremely difficult and property/land values are outrageously high!! I believe most people that rent are actually nice people and need to be treated much better than they are. Just because we rent doesn't mean we should be treated as second class citizens :-( 
Changing rules for long term tenants 
Ability to view properties with more flexibility.  Outside of standard work hours etc.
Make it easier & quicker to evict tenants who don't pay the rent.
"I dislike that I feel like I am controlled by a 25 year old, who tries her hardest to dictate how I can live in my house! Our property manager is so hard to deal with and we have been stellar renters for years in the same property. It is very frustrating as we treat our home like we own it, NEVER missed a rent payment, and we have made our home far better than when we moved in, yet we constantly have to deal with harassment from our PM. :-("
"Ability to negotiate a fair rental on renewal.  The agent is only working for the landlord and it is ""agree or leave"" with leaving have a considerable cost both financially, physically and emotionally."
Allow for property managers to be able to have people evicted from a property due to damage or overcrowding or people not on the lease.  Also if someone can't pay the rent the bond money should be signed over to the property manager to pay the outstanding amounts.  Not have a magistrate give it back to the tenants who are in debt to the landlord and then leave a heap of unwanted items at the house.
Having a renter's representative on the Body Corporate Committees of apartment buildings. I have experienced personal harassment and aggressive behaviour from 'owners' who thought they had more rights than renters in common areas. The Building Manager was not in a position to represent renters without a conflict of interest as their commission is based on owner's preferences. 
Make propety managers accountable 
"Legislation has not kept pace with technological evolution, and tools that are available in the present day. For example, the prescribed format of an Entry Condition Report is incredibly basic and bland, and almost certainly ensures that there is ample room for ambiguity over property condition at the end of a tenancy."
Better communication between real estate/property managers and tenants
"Real Estates need to have turn around times enforced on maintenance ETC 
Bonds are also super expensive and real estates will try find anything to retain extra money for the owner.  "
Limit maximum rental increase
Make rules and regulations more prescriptive and less open to interpretation. i.e. 'within a reasonable timeframe' etc. that is not helpful!
"Less often inspections for longer term tenants (from 3 months to 6 months after living there for over a year). With new buildings in estates, internet isn't default included and we had to pay for the NBN installation fee and go through all the trouble of setting it up. Internet isn't classified as a necessary utility like water or electricity so the real estate/owners don't care/don't have to help. Perhaps classify the NBN has a utility the owners are responsible for because it's ridiculous to leave a house without any internet access. Pre-NBN it wasn't an issue as everyone could get ADSL and just have to organise it the same as electricity. "
"Less Inspections.
Point system for good tenants"
"Clean up the filth that rent.  The place I rented in 2011 had cigarette burns and lighter burns in the carpet.  The carpet stunk like old marijuana smoke, stunk like old pets and stagnant urine.  Unfortunately, the rental agreement was organised by work and I didn't have the option to refuse the accommodation.  Nonetheless, it's paramount rental standards are lifted."
Being able to put things on walls or being allowed a small pet in appartments/units.
i dont rent there but i have a a property in gladstone.
I would like the ability to personalize by repainting room or putting photos or prints on the wall.
I’d like to not be overlooked as a potential tenant just because I have pets. I would be happy to supply documents supporting that I am a responsible pet owner and would not object to a real estate/landlord contacting my vet to ensure I look after my pets.
"More parking for tenants, as we have had four people with four cars and only spaces for two - the other two have to park out on the street, as the complex only has parking for visitors. "
"There needs to be a greater onus on landlords to ensure that homes are safe, secure, and structurally sound. Landlords especially in student areas know that they will always be able to find a tenant, and as such seem to be actively avoiding maintenance and security issues."
"What is considered ""wear and tear"" seems to change with different property managers/companies, etc.
Vacate cleaning - seems agents are never happy on the initial clean even when getting professional cleaners in.
Issues with the property when responsibility is the property owners. Issues are never sorted in a timely manner."
More checks in relation to tenants rental history
"More control over rogue REA trying to steal money from bonds and being unreasonable

Longer times for breaches, such as NSW which has 14 days for rent arrears

The end of TICA or a database of bad REA like TIca"
That there was certain rules that real estate agents needed to adhere to. That the residential tenancy board actually were able to do something or hold some power. 
Real estates having respect for clients in the rental not just the owner. Also not trying to exploit renters and take their bond unnecessarily. 
"Rental properties (houses, units, etc) must be more open to applicants with pets. many applicants have dogs or cats, which, for many people are an important part of their life and family. "
Pets should be considered part of the family and allowed on a lease with less scrutiny - I would be happy to pay a pet bond to be allowed to have a pet without having to obtain approval by jumping through hoops first.
maintenance is a must for owners
Better communication from our rental agent.
Have the same vacate notice periods for landlords and tenants
"the pendulum has swung too far in favor of the tenants.  the property owners are the ones investing hundreds of thousands of dollars to effectively provide low cost housing for tenants who can't afford to buy. those owners rights need to be taken more in to account. for example, a tenant can break a lease by claiming ""financial hardship"" and often with very little proof being required, be allowed out of their lease without penalty. it's the same with damage that tenant's cause in a property. i understand it can't be ""new for old"" replacement however if the carpet (for example) is in ok condition and would last another 5 years but the tenant damages it, the owner still needs to pay for all new carpet even if they're weren't budgeting for it, and the tenant might only have to pay $100 because they only soiled a small area of 10 year old carpet. These are just some examples of how the tenants rights nearly always far outweigh the property owners."
"Low cost, affordable housing for singles with pets."
Greater control of rental agencies by a governing body.
People in the house before me didn't have pets with flees.
"To be aloud pets, and not to be kicked out of a home just because you want things fixed."
"The quarterly inspections by the agent, especially when they will not accommodate any change of day although requested every time as my preference is to be present for the inspection which always fell on a day I work (part time) and they wouldn't change the day of the visit."
The most troublesome part of renting is dealing with Property Managers. I've had good experiences but a lot of the time communication is really poor and you're dealing with someone that doesn't care. 
pets allowed in rental properties
Reduction of house inpections.
Have been pretty satisfied.  Having Land Lords make repairs would be great.
"Would love for owners to approve cats/dogs on the premises without making tenants jump through hoops
Having a set time frame to have issues fixed with the property or be forced to reduce rent-have had a leaky roof since March and still no eta to have it fixed"
More regulations on dodgy agents
"Make the tenants' Notice of intention to leave & the landlord's Notice to vacate fair and equable, the same time frame ie 30 days.  The Act as stands the landlord grossly discriminated again and suffers financial loss when the tenant only has to provide 14 days and the owner has to provide 60 day.  It takes longer than 14 days to find a new tenant during the period of receiving the notice, advertising, inspections processing a suitable tenant, drafting all the tenant documentation, new tenant reading and signing, processing documentation, entry inspection and condition report etc......  A lot more time than 14 days in which the tenant is now allowed. There should be 30 days for the tenant and 30 days for the landlord!"
"As a young family it is very difficult to find suitable housing that allows my children the freedom to be children and not be limited by the rules of home-owners. EG - Fastening furniture to walls to prevent them tipping, owning pets, being able to decorate walls."
Need a register for tenants and landlords to verify that the property being rented is safe for occupancy.
"We have been renting the same House for 5 year,s The Real estate we sign up with sold their rental list to another Real estate which we would not have rented from ,as they have a bad name in the town we live in .But we didn,t have any choice about them taking over our rental.The Real Estate we are now with are rude and do not want to take care of thing,s and are known for try to keep Bond,s at the end of lease.We should of  had the choice to end the Lease when the Real Estate we sign up with sold.My sister has been if her Rental for 6 year,s  and has 4 real estate,s the newest being in Brisbane when we living in Gympie."
availability of realistic rent pricing for pensioners
Some real estates lie about the condition before and after of property 
Real Estate agents being unable to make up their rules and bully tenants with their position
"Firmer definitions of what ""wear and tear"" is!  No fully sure what it means."
Real estate agents are unhelpful.
equal notice of termination requirements for landlords and tenants 
"Inability to make minor cosmetic changes to a property that is already not particularly nice.  This includes pictures on walls, garden work."
The QCAT system could do with some improvement.  Tenants know even if the court judgement enforces them to pay monies owing to landlords they know that in reality they do not have to pay and without any consequences of this non-payment.
Regular Maintenance In the Property
Give Tenants better rights regarding owners in-action regarding repairs
Fewer rent increases 
"Make expectations more black and white. I feel there is too much grey areas in legislation which is interpreted differently by owners, tenants, RTA advisers and the tribunal adjudicators. "
stronger laws to prevent tenants trashing the property and leaving their unwanted items behind.  to eliminate these problems increase rental from one month to two months
"Standard minimum two year lease. No penalty for breaking a lease after a certain point (6 months in, for example)."
Quicker responses from Rental Agents regarding issues brought to their attention.
Pets allowed at more places 
Property owners don't fix things when they should yet keep putting up the rent.
"The stand over tactics that real estates utilize when rentals are at a premium, the large number of invasive inspections that are required and the fact the whole industry treats you like the worst portion of the community. "
Ability to hang picture frames up on walls. For long term tenants longer gaps between house inspections.
Availability of desired property type at desired price range (e.g. low availability of 3 bed houses with 5km radius of desired suburb $500/under per week.
Easier to have a pet in a rental property
"Better quality (bigger properties, including balconies/ storage space/ car parks) units in the city limits for reasonable prices"
Allowing of Pets in Rentals
We had a dispute with our landlord and found that we were very much at a disadvantage to defend ourselves. The rules should be more fair (I'm hoping I have a chance to elaborate later in this survey).
"I recently moved out of my property and rented it out.  One thing I found very surprising was the format in which the real estate agent gave me tenancy applications.  There is no system in place for the tenant's income to be assessed to make sure they can afford the rental amount which they're applying for, it was left up to me to try to work this out and I didn't even know if the weekly income amounts that the real estate agent was providing were before or after tax.  I work in finance so was somewhat comfortable assessing this, however would not expect all landlords to be able to do this and could see them assuming the real estate agents do this already. I would consider it to be irresponsible to be accepting tenants applications when they can't afford the rent.  There are no checks in place to ensure this and the only information I had to base my decision off was a weekly salary amount, which as I mentioned previously did not even specify if the amount was before or after tax."
Being able to paint the house and decorate the walls with paintings. 
Pest inspection should be the owners responsibility not the tennant
Rent could be affordable
I own a rental property and have been left out of pocket multiple times by tenants who fail to leave the property in the same standard as they received it.  My worst experience is $7K in damages that I'm chasing up the ex tenant via a debt collector.  The current rules are skewed to far towards the tenant with little recourse to the tenant for any damages.  I've had experiences where QCAT have favoured the tenant without the tenant providing any form of evidence to the case and myself having to provide well over 100 pages of documentation and photographs.  There was no recourse to the tenant for this.
not having nosy neighbours who put false complaints into the real estate agent 
"1. Bond Refund & Dispute Process
Both need to be clearly communicated to tenants/renters about the bond refund process particularly if there could be a dispute, I think it is important that tenants/renters are advised to submit their bond refund before the renting agent otherwise they will be facing court costs.  Most renters are not aware of this and don't have the money to pay court costs so they forfeit the bond.

2. RTA should investigate Renting Agents that continually dispute bond claims and know to submit a bond refund request before the tenant as they know majority of tenants don't have the money to cover court costs or know how.

More so now that Renting Agents have electronic access to submit a Bond Request directly and immediately on the morning of the end of the lease. Where as Tenants can complete the form electronically still needs to print, sign, scan and then submit.  
The access is set up in the Renting Agents favour.

3. Rental References - Black Lists or Black Marks amongst agents
It is unfair that where periods of rent has fallen behind for whatever reason affects future rental applications particularly where the tenant has caught up and maintained a reasonable history of rent payments.  The process requires investigation.

4. Court process: where renting agents have breached the conditions e.g. ""did not conduct the exit inspection within the stated period"" can not be held accountable in the court process needs to be reviewed but rather be told that it is a matter for RTA to deal with? Its law so why is it not considered as part of the 'dispute process'?
"
Transparency in rent cost vs house value
As a pensioner would like to wait less than 4yrs for housing.
Remove Quarterly inspections. They obliterate the peace/ quiet enjoyment of the home. Yearly inspections should suffice.
Greater flexibility in how we can live our lives in our tental
Having been on both ends of the market (both rented and owned investment properties) I really feel the communication between home owners and tenants needs to be better and inspections a bit more often
Permission to make small changes to the property 
"Uniform standards for liveability, especially insulation"
More professional approach from agents
"The quality of real estate agents, as realised through greater regulatory protection of tenants and punishment for poor agent conduct."
More responsibility to fall on tenant
"make it as easy as it used to be- visit real estate, get key, inspect property, say yes, fill out form, done."
"Some tenants expectations of what they want and think there entitled too.
Some tenants attitude to managers and owners."
Greater choice with pets
Less frequent inspections. Every 12 weeks is unnecessary.
Rental Agreements and the different amendments and attachments make it difficult to fully understand. 
"The property owner can be decieved into accepting an application (containing many inaccuracies or just plain lies and mistruths) from a tenant and if later (after the lease is signed by both parties), the arrangements are clearly not working, the owner has no option to seek to have the lease terminated (except if the tenant breaches various usual requirements such as paying the rent on time etc.)"
More flexible lease terms 
Landlord should take more responsibility for upkeep and not just the rent!
Greater fairness for me as a landlord when renting to tenants who default in rent and property maintenance
"The way renters are treated by owners and property managers. As though we're very unimportant (even though we make them both money, we are the consumer) and can be taken advantage of. This culture needs to change."
"Being able to provide feedback re landlords.  At this time feels a bit one sided ie landlords can be critical of tenants but not the other way around.

Improving rules around pet ownership and tenants rights."
Morw flexible lease terms - Landlords should not be able to insist on 12 month leases and make 6 months more readily acceptable.
Tenants to pay their rent on time
Is that you don't have to beg the owners to fix things around the house. 
Trained/informed Property Managers who know the legal requirements they need to follow in order for them to carry out the necessary requirements to do their jobs properly.
Better communication between body corporates and tenants.
Loss of business/trading licence for agents that take advantage of or lie to tenants. 
"Extend the term of lease, make it lessee's choice - I want longer but am refused and rent is put up every six months or less even though I re-sign a new lease.  The cost to move on and the low availability of suitable properties in my area mean I stay against my better judgement. As I am semi-retired and under pension age, working only casually at the local university, this is very stressful."
"Make the balance of landlord rights more equal compared to tenants rights.  For example, why does a tenant only have to give 14 days notice that they are leaving the agreement whereas a landlord must provide 2 months?   It should be 2 months for both. "
have owners do maintenance asap
I would increase the bond amount to 6 weeks rent to cover reletting costs after vacate and be able to enforce professional carpet and pest controlling on vacate. Also make water a utility in QLD.
"Be allowed to change things, put photos up, fix the cracking paint job on the skirting boards, change the curtains etc. Just make it home"
Don't trust community housing agents and never rent a property owned by the department of housing.
"Being able to affix furniture, and make more homely reasonable changes to a property would be wonderful."
"Landlords are required to provide curtains - one regional landlord did not. 
"
Tennent Responsibility to maintain Landlords Property
Buy a rental next time in an area that the local council doesn't just say yes to everything and then leave you with nothing except high rates to pay for infrastructure that developers should have paid for in advance.
"Longer leases; more notice of property sale, eviction etc; more time between inspections (every 12 weeks?!) "
Contact details for the owner so that when the real estate agency is not passing on valuable information to the owner then they can be bypassed. When you report potentially life threatening issues to the agent like huge cracks opening in the walls and they not only do nothing about it but start sending abusive and bullying emails to you then you have somewhere to report this kind of behaviour.
"1. As I live alone on the aged pension, the ability to keep a dog for my mate;
2. The ability to hang a clock or painting on the wall;
3. The benefit of a lease of, say,up to two years, or at least, renewal of an existing 12 month lease if a dwelling is not intended to be sold.  I have a landlord who will not renew a now expired lease and who only allows me to remain on a periodic tenancy without explanation as to why. "
"allow dogs and cats if there is a sustainable backyard, no exceptions "
"The legal requirements or adherence of Agents to the law with respect to all aspects of the RTAgreement; including but not limited to all disclosures and inclusions within the contract, including those not listed or details provided (e.g. having to notify a $300 payment is required to establish NBN connectivity); all NEW HOME rentals ""under warranty"" works attended before occupency of Tenant - do not use tentants for this task which is not there responsibility; confirm Confidentiality and Privacy laws and CONSENT prior to Agents handing out private details to companies and strangers alike; respect towards decient and compliant tenants"
Bond refund/transfers easier process. More information on what a real estate can't do
Make it easier to regain possession after a tenant stops paying rent.  The current statutory waiting period plus waiting for the magistrates court plus waiting for the police adds up to over ten weeks.
"Their needs to be far more done to mitigate the loss to both Landlords and tenants in the normal transactions under the Act.  'Property Managers' are already doing far more (under the current 'ACT' than what they are trained to do! 
If they are expected to be more responsible, then the minimum training standards must also be increased. At the moment you are expecting a Nurse to do Brain surgery!!"
Have set rules (more specific) of the return conditions of the property in order to get your full bond back as a tenant.  
Stop landlords making money from people who are too poor to buy a home - move to European models where there can be long term leases with ability to make a real home including changes.
Better services provided by the rental agent and proof of expenses (eg original water bills) given to tenant. Why can they invoice an amount without showing proof?
Pricing of rentals to be across the board and not set on the postcode and made value for money
"How horrible it is to find a new place to live. There is such limited time to look. Usually 1-2 weeks. Often you sign for a place and a better place hits the market the next day. It's always so stressful. It would be good if you could apply for places 6-8 weeks prior to moving in. 
"
"Not being discriminated against when it comes to age, single parent, wealth."
Availability of longer lease terms
Standard of some apartments has been poor
More flexibility regarding putting art work on the walls - using temporary picture hooks.
Owners taking responsibility for maintenance in a timely manner. Easier options to rent with pets 
"Make the Renting Rules in Qld more balanced for both Renters & Landlord.
The Tenants are given to many easy rules when renting in Qld. Care & Maintenance
by Renters is disgraceful. Bond money is never enough to cover the costs. Qld Government makes Tenants think they are entitled & the Landlord should pay for bad Tenanting damage. It is extremely unbalanced."
I would like a clearer acknowledgement from rental owners and real estates that natural wear and tear occurs and for the tenant to foot the bill for this doesn't seem fair. 
"Get rid of the ""great areas"" in Legislation "
Better and faster dispute resolution process
Having Internet connection as a mandatory requirement for rental properties
Less Intrusive inspections
"Proper photographic documentation of damage to the house prior to and after renting by someone independent of both the owner and the renting agency.

"
"More flexibility with what is/isnt allowed. EG: Installation of air conditioning.
Fairer inspections with regards to what is considered fair wear and tear.
Fairer rent policy, not just a made up standardised letter explaining why the rent is going up."
improved formalised recourse arrangements for owners should a tenant damage property
"More support for owner management of rental properties (info sessions, support groups, educational sessions)"
Definition and understanding of 'fair wear and tear'
Total smoke free environment for units / apartments - no smoking permitted on balconies or within the confines of the units. With a designated smoking area away from entrance and public access.
Pet friendly with no discrimination and affordable prices
"Get rid of body corporate requirement for pet approval, and let owner approval be sufficient."
Fee structure of Rental Agency - too high to manage rentals
To be treated like a person and not like trash. 
All properties allowing small pets
"Please look at changing the Act on when a rental property is up for sale.  We were bullied into signing a 12 month lease and the house was listed for sale 2 months and 2 weeks after we signed the lease. We have been at this residence for 5 years.
It is extremely stressful for the tenant being told we have open homes weekly and in limbo on what we are doing and have to stay until the end of the lease."
The landlords need to have more power in the event of evicting a tenant where they have breached the lease. The police should be able to be called for assistance.
Decrease cost of renting
Be invited to be part of the body corporate meetings for the unit block
Ability to have pets. To have a non-smoking apartment block. I find the real estate agents have no care about the renter. 
A property should not be able to be put on the market in the first 6 months of tenancy.
"Non-renewal of lease's without justification. Our lease in which the real estate received no complaints about us and strongly urged the owner to renew has not been renewed meaning we have to move out again after only being on a 6 month lease, due to another tenant circumventing the agency and falsely complaining about us directly to the owner due to them being friends. "
 I think there needs to be more laymans interpretation of the legislation and laws as many people are caught out by things they do not understand.
Having longer opening hours for the RTA Call Centre
Real Estate agents need to be more upfront and NOT use false advertising to gain tenant viewings.  I recently was looking for a home and nearly 100% of the photos that were used on the internet were false and by no means any indication to the actual state of the house current.
"Have the real estate agents have more respect for the tenants.  We were made feel as though the landlord has all the power.  The property manager told us ""if you don't like it, go to the RTA"".  Which we did.  
We were made feel that we would be kicked out of our home at the end of the lease if we insisted on safety repairs being done."
A guideline on 'fair wear & tear'
"Agents being able to create database of upcoming properties available for rent in advance. I never can understand why when a tenant has to give 8weeks notice of intention to stay (or vacate) at expiry of fixed lease, agents can't likewise use that timeframe to advise of properties available for rent, instead doing so at the last moment when they are within a week of being vacant & at ""available to inspect"" stage. As a family we have paid for double rents averaging 4-5weeks each time to secure a house (that is already vacant & available) in advance preparation for a move from our current leased home. As a tenant you cannot sign a lease until you have inspected a property. Most properties are not available to be inspected until after vacant. This leaves families in the predicament of knowing a set date they have to be vacated up to 8 weeks in advance, yet not being able to choose another property available to rent at around that same date. It is incredibly stressful & in my opinion a huge gamble as a family to have to leave it to chance within a week or 2 of moving out of your house that a house in the same school area, or work area at the same kind of price will by chance be available. We have rented 3 properties in succession in the same suburb of Brisbane since 2014, each time being given notice lease cannot be renewed as the landlord is selling or moving into the property themselves, requiring us to move with 8 weeks notice but with this timeframe also falling during mid December. This despite when originally inspecting both properties asking specifically if it is a long term investment property. We are wonderful tenants, have glowing references & not once been denied any portion of our bond refund. We have rented 8 properties in Qld spanning 20years. Each time I have asked agencies what properties they may have coming up vacant at that time. Each time told they only have current list of available properties. They cannot advise of properties even for a drive by or give an indication if any at all are even possibly coming up for expiry/new tenants. So, we are left with only 2 choices. 1. inspect the current properties listed, put in an application & agree to pay the rent from the agents/landlords preferred start dates, thereby paying double rents in excess of $1200 a week for weeks at a time OR 2. don't start the process until within a week or 2 of having to vacate your current home & hope to goodness something is available or find yourself homeless! Even the best case scenario requires double rent for at least 1-2weeks. Renting is geared around the old view of young people, students or couples without children. People who are happy to rent any suburb, who have less possessions & the ability to move out/in in a day by piling up the friends cars/utes. The face of renting has changed. Many families are forced into long term renting due to high house prices & are losing an extra few thousand dollars a year with double rent payments & moving costs & not by their choice or from being poor tenants. Our last move we paid double rent for 4 weeks @ $550 each house, then paid to hire a truck, took 5days off work to pack, fill truck, unpack & bond clean. This repeated cycle is not helping in our quest for a deposit to get into housing market again. At $1200 a week in 2X rents alone it would make most mortgage payments seem a breeze. "
"It would be nice to have more freedom when it comes to pets and house interior like putting up pictures. Also, more transparency from real estate about what the bills we are being charged for - for what period and what for and why"
Having more housing options which include family pets and also having a say in getting issues fixed or addressed in a timely manner.
Less paperwork - Exit and entry report is not very user friendly
"In Victoria, they have removed the pets/no pets option ensuring that people aren't disadvantaged because they have a pet."
No incentive for long term tenancy - Tenants put rents up everytime you continue lease and property ends up being more expensive then the average rental in the area - lower rents are available if you move to a new property - the cost to move is too high with compulsory bond cleans from approved service providers of the real estate - you have to go with them or lose your bond - 
Ability to conduct a police check report on rerntal applicants
Allowance for pets and minor amendments to property
More flexibility for owners and tenants around bought and sale

easier access to tenants rights
Real Estate agencies lack of awareness.  They are only interested in profits and treat everyone else with contempt.
I'd like my minor maintenance requests to be completed not ignored. I think they just get forgotten. 
More clear understanding of legislation. No grey areas or open to interpretation 
Agents not bothering you so much
Cheaper rent especially for people such as myself who are apprentices or students. 
"Allowing pets in all rental houses, as they are an integral part of families."
"allowing pets
better, more organise, experienced, friendly property managers
"
"Security of tenancy. Always worried the owner is going to terminate your lease for whatever reason. The government should allow Institutional investors into the rental market with capped rent prices like in Europe, New York. 
Mums and Dads investors are always looking for the high returns whereas Institutional  Investors look to property valuation over a long period of time."
Outstanding rent to be paid to owners no matter their income status.
Grow more plants on my balcony.
I don't rent I am a property owner
more car parking  per. Unit on the properties
Choice for animals to be included
Have more owners open to the idea of lowering the rent for a long term tenant 
That if tenants are not suitable and identified there is a door of opportunity to be supported in a way to learn to be better tenants.
"Create a system that provides true balance between the interests of tenants and property owners.

The following question is improperly provided, so I picked the one most applicable to our experiences as tenant.

The interests of neither party are properly protected right now.  Poor tenants routinely destroy property without reparation.  Poor property owners routinely price gouge tenants and fail to properly maintain their property.

I have no definitive answer(s), but perhaps some form of two-way escrow?  Bond protects the property owner, but is neither sufficient nor in any way protective of tenants."
"would like to know if they have a pet in our house, I know so many tenants hide the pets from the agent"
Watch dog for real estate agents
Fixed long term rentals available as an option with the government guaranteeing rent & maintenance from tenant damage. Kind of like a DHA lease.
Stricter rules and regulations around who can purchase management rights to complexes.  I have experienced a couple new to Australia from China who purchased management rights to the complex I lived in and they did not even know the Residential Tenancies Act rules and regulations.  They did electrical work themselves not by an experienced and certified electrician.
"Provide more Social/Community Housing 
"
Have 1 washroom per bedroom
For repairs and upgrades to be done correctly not with bandaid approach

Being able to use the house to live in- being able to have an animal for example.
Making the same time period of tenants and landlords notification to depart/end lease.
Able to treat the property more as a family home 
"Being allowed to have a pet, and being able to hang frames on the wall without seeking permission from the owner for every single frame (which is usually denied because the contract stated to not hang anything on walls)."
Access to the landlord and not via the real estate agent.  Using a third party between the landlord and tenant creates confusion and real estate agents don't always tell the truth.  
"There are too many rules going the tenant's way, there need to be stricter rules regarding Tenant's re looking after property and rent being paid on time. "
Maintenance to be undertaken when needed.
It to be a requirement that owners inform you about whether they are likely to renew your lease 3 months before the lease concludes. 
Better control over how the tenants treat your property
More realistic conditions impressed by the real estate with regard to clealiness and getting bond back.
The current laws favour the tenants by a large margin. The laws need to be changed to be fairer to the landlord.
"Lower the cost of rent.
"
"The number of times we have inspections is over the top! I think after 5yrs the agent knows what to expect, everything is always perfect every time! "
"Tenants should have some guarantee of the availability of a premises. E.g. >5yrs
6-12 month leases are and should be seen as short term.
Scandinavian countries have implemented these practices and similar laws should be brought in here."
"Property managers are bullies. I've rented contless houses over the years & all property managers treat you like crap, stand over you, & bully you. If you stand up to them, they will make your life hell, esp. when it comes to the exit report & getting your bond back"
"Less inspections. Our Real Estate Agent comes in 4 times a year to inspect the property and I just think that is too much. Also don't give keys out to trades people to enter from non urgent reasons, they should ring and make an appointment for when the renter is home. And give more notice - 6 days for inspections and the same day for non urgent repairs/inspections by trades people is not enough time."
"I am a landlord and feel that currently tenants have more rights than landlords. When my tenants decide to not renew a lease they stop paying rent one month before departing and then I have to use the bond as rent and for repairs and usually end up out of pocket. QCAT from my one experience and experiences from other landlords I have spoken with lean towards siding with tenants most of the time.  Landlords need some backup from authorities as well as tenants. I have always been a good landlord - repairing whatever needs done quickly and giving tenants improvements, but in the end the tenants always leave me out of pocket and I am now thinking to selling my properties as I foresee the situation for me just getting worse."
"The ability to have pets (within reason), and having a pet not counting against approval.

Perhaps the information provided to the owner by the real estate about the applicants to be anonymous - no names given to the owner, only the absolute necessary information required to make a decision. "
Pets being allowed.  More control over times tradesmen can come to house when pets are involved.  Ability to have input into times inspections are held to ensure that I can be available to attend
Maintenance issues to be fixed quickly.
I would like all real estates that rent be openly reviewed by consumersso that we know if that real estate is reliable and will look after the rental and the tenants appropriately 
"Landlords are getting too greedy. Mine is now charging for water..what’s next!
I believe rent should include water."
Inspections from real estate agents
We receive a power bill that covers two units. It is shared 50/50 but that really isn't a comfortable arrangement. Also definitely feel pets should be allowed in rentals. So separate power bill. Solar water system. Pets allowed.
Why do landlords need to provide more notice to end a period lease than a tenant?
Better protection and higher bonds for landlords as Tenants can easily get away with owing landlords too much money.
I would like to make it compulsory that tennents are allowed to have pets no questions asked with damage done to be up to the Tennent to repair or for it to be taken out of the bond 
Does not need to provide too many documents for consideration
"The rental legislation seems to have been set up with the idea that renting is a short term thing, rather than the reality of now where a large number of renters will be renting for the rest of their lives."
Better communication between Real Estate and Property Owner 
Professionalism and stability of property managers
Tenants need to be more accountable for Leaving  rental property in the same clean undamaged condition as at the start of the tenancy
Method of payment - being forced to utilise a payment system that incurs ongoing charges
"An an owner, a right to rent under conditions."
"Not enough felxibility in how you can live-ie pictures on walls etc.
Silly exit mandatory cleaning despite the place being kept spot;less..exit cleans have just become a money making machine for cleaners and I fear there's agent kick backs going on."
Update the Act to reflect changes to utility costs.
Not requiring permission to own a pet
As a previous renter & current owner of a rental I have not had any issues with the current rules/laws as they are. I appreciate the protection as an owner & understood why they were there when I was renting. 
Honesty and reliability in real estates
"As a tenant, longer lease term offered and able to have a dog.
As an owner, an easy guide to manage property myself or better service from real estate agents."
Quicker replies and action taken for maintenance needed
Better communication by real estate agent.
Make it mandatory that units/flats are checked for mould and other damaging conditions.
Better standards of rental management by real estate agents.
"Communication with real estate agents. Most of the times, they don’t reply back. "
"Agents and bond cleaners have full power and monopoly over what is being charged for exit cleaning fees. Between agents and bond cleaners, they conspire to charge the highest price. If you do not use the bond cleaner recommended by the agent, then the agent finds fault with everything you cleaner may or may not do."
Allow pets in any rental property 
More accountability on rental agents to fulfil their contract to landlords
"More and more newer construction are aimed towards people with income that are above 100k/pa. Brisbane require more affordable rental spaces for workers closer to the CBD. These workers are looking for spaces closer since public transport costs need to be factored in.

Also, some units that doesn't include AC, if the owner/property manager isn't willing to chip in for the purchase and installation, the tenant is allowed to get it installed with permission but in the end, when the tenancy ends, the owner reaps the benefit."
Better service for emergency repairs frim Real Estate
"There needs to be a pet bond or pet insurance for landlords. No more exclusions and knock backs due to having pets. This is becoming a problem for many tenants resulting in the surrendering and abandonment of many pets.
 Also interstate and overseas investors make it extremely difficult for maintenance and repairs (communication) and international investors generally refuse pets as they have different laws and we don’t have pet insurance for rentals. "
Allow tenants to nail wall for decoration e.g. picture frames.
"Once the bond is paid that should be it, if rent goes up $5 PW why is there need to pay an increase  in the bond, really"
"Having the option to negotiate on certain things without being immediately dismissed as a potential tenant - utility bills, having pets, lease terms etc."

The option to make the rental house a home.
I’d like to see tenants have more responsibility to look after your property because some of the damage is not called for
more incentives for tenants with a good rental history 
Being able to hang things on walls if agree to repair prior to exit; less theft in apartment building
More control over choosing tenants

"Cheaper rent.
Having a home up to modern standards and not be worried about the repercussions for asking for home maintenance. "
More than 24 hours required for entry notices. 
Annual rent increases.
ensure EVERY member of QCAT is a landlord
Stop landlords selling the property after signing a new lease
"Less inspections, right to pets."
Agents being held accountable for repairs.  Not being forced to sign up with 'their' energy companies and internet providers.  You should be able to choose your own.
Allow renters to have more control over the house and garden. It would be nice to be able to do more without worrying that the owner isn’t ok with it
"Minimum routine inspections are far too frequent (current min every 12 weeks).  This is a very stressful event, and having such frequent inspections makes you feel like a prisoner getting a cell shakedown.  12 weeks is a short time and seriously goes against the having fair and peaceful residence of the rented property clause.  I think a minimum of once every 6 months would be much more reasonable. "
"Pets and being able to hang things on the walls 
"
The difficulty of finding a house to rent that is pet friendly
On site management company to have more comprehensive information when supplying inspection reports.
"I have had my property damaged by tenants with chairs and table damaged, locks put on bedroom doors, holes in wall, gas cookers used on carpet leaving burnt circles into the fabric. Dont let tenants do as they please."
"Dealing with tenants bad behaviour, especially interfering neighbours peace and comfort"
Less frequent inspections 
"Awareness of rights as tenants to complete Notice To Remedy forms to send to landlords that requires them to fix broken things etc. Didn't know I had that right as tenant until I became a landlord and was issuing tenants a notice and read the detail. Slack landlords who don't fix basic things (locks, plumbing, wiring etc) are irresponsible but rarely culpable. "
Notice periods should be the same for both landlord & tenant.
greater flexibility around end of lease arrangements
would like more stability
Eliminate Land Tax
4 Weeks notice to vacate a property 
Tenants that pay the rent on time and look after the property
"I would change the ability for the realtors to deduct from your bond for cleaning. I have had friends who have had deductions made because the very hard-to-clean chandelier had dust on it?! I have moved into places that weren't cleaned properly. There should be a proper procedure, where the realtor needs to have appropriate proof and documentation in order to make deductions for such reasonings. "
As an owner I would like to the right to allow or disallow pets.
Provision of natural ventilation 
"An enforced time limit on repairs and maintenance that aren't classified as ""urgent"" but still effect day-to-day life"
The remnants have too many rights.
It remains difficult to evict a really recalcitrant tenant if they are determined to stay.
Get the ruddy state government out of the picture who have caused me undue losses three times over the last 30years and interfering with local councils to the end a town without a council ends up governing the existing one being Calliope not Gladstone! Now rent barely covers rates and maintenance due to outside interference in the area.  
It's so slow to get repairs done in a rental property. Sometimes it can take months. I wish there was a quicker way to report an issue and have it fixed.
Having work done on the property as it gets older and not on the renter
Make the tenant more accountable the cleaning the mess they leave when exiting the property 
"As a renter in a Dept of Housing Unit complex, not having an area for (small) children to play in makes things really difficult. 
I think having somewhere safe outside for them to play would be highly beneficial for both the children and their parents/carer. Even being put into an area that has parks close by would be beneficial. "
Better property management staff
By pass the letting agent to be able to contact the landlord to get things repaired.
Cap on time from to sell property with tenets in before end of lease
Being railroaded into resigning a lease or give notice to leave 4 months out before the end of you current lease is likened to bullying. 
Abililty to chase tenants owing money after they leave a tenancy.
Lowering the cost of renting per week
Private lessors be availed of easier access to databases such as TICA
"Entry and exit conditions. The property is always run down and dirty when I take possession. And yet even after a bond clean, I am still charged a cleaning bill. "
I believe that the situation is now too lenient on the renter. As a landlord we have had some very difficult situations with tenants without any easy means to remove them. The new possibility of people being able to bring animals in without permission from the landlord is very unsuitable.
Ability to transfer bond between tenancies
"Allowing renters to make the rental like their own home. Cant gave pictures up, cant have a pet, insoections after only being a property 3 weeks. Being judged about what we yse rooms for. Sometimes a total invasion of privacy"
To be able to treat the house as my own eg hanging pictures and having pets
I would implement housing collectives that ensure that rent never exceeds 30% of income.
"Provide more opportunities to have pets. As long as you are willing to take responsibility for any damage they may cause and are aware of the cleaning standards required before vacating, you should have the option to have a pet."
Legislation that recognises the huge investment owners of rental properties have made.
"Ability to evict tenants without a 2 months wait, when tenant can give only 2 weeks notice to leave."
Should you invite someone to live with you whilst renting and not have to go through the whole application (ie their full income and previous address) as it isn’t relevant as I would be solely contributing to the rent and responsibilies of the premises. 
Less inspections. Quarterly inspections are too much an invasion of privacy 
"Rental prices are high. 
Application process is difficult. "
I am a landlord only but have been satisfied with how my properties are being managed.
Allow withdrawal of rent payments when issues with the property are not fixed in a timely manner
More pet friendly properties
The ability to get maintenance done ASAP without affecting the price of the rent during lease renewal
Property owners should have a responsibility to improve their properties in the best interest of the renters (e.g. compulsory standards of homes even for older houses)
Easier opportunity to have pets in rental properties. 
The whole area in manged in a very confrontational manner
Minor changes to property without approval
"I am a landlord and believe that the rules at this point are fair and any changes should take into account the landlords ability to govern their investment, costs incurred for a landlord to own and rent a property let alone the damages that they incur from tenants that don't care as it is not their property.  This service is supporting the government by taking the load off public housing.  If you look back at the Bob Hawk period when they tried to undermine the private rental market with changes that affected the landlord and investments, hence a drop in private rental properties and a increase in the public housing sector.      "
Remove the rule preventing landlords from increasing rental price if the existing tenant (on a fixed term lease) breaks the lease.
"Whether you're a tenant or a landlord, the rules should be fair. Current rules are too bias towards the tenant. A tenant and the landlord should both be required to give the same amount of notice to the other before ending an agreement or renewing an agreement"
Not having to have to negotiate to be able to have pets 
2 months notice for an owner but only 2 weeks notice for a tenant is unbalanced
More flexibility with pets. There are plenty of properties perfectly suited to having animals but are 'no pets allowed'. Children do more damage to houses than pets
The constant rent increases when mo maintenance has been done the excess water bills when all we are doing is maintaining the landlord garden with have just been given a $300 excess water bill for 2 people living in a 4 bedroom house with a pool all the water we use is to maintain a garden 
"When we moved in the carpets smelled of previous tenants pets. The agents treated us like we were stupid and said she couldn't smell anything. Then we found out she had ""an accident and can no longer smell"". I think is BS too. We had the carpets cleaned prior to move in at our cost and agent refused to reimburse us. The professional who cleaned on our request said the carpets stank of pets and were not cleaned satisfactorily. After we paid a professional, there was no issue with carpets.
There are a list of issues with the property managers and their lack of follow thru, but I would be typing all day."
getting the agent and owner to do repairs when they need doing 
It seems to be very competitive to get approval for properties so I would like to see a much fairer system in place.
Ability to encourage owners to make minimal improvements including ceiling fans and appropriate window coverings.
Attempting to exit a share house is very difficult  there are many ways that people can keep you on leases and not let you leave if you are in a bad position. Real estates have explained to me that if I was to leave they would put something against my name. 
"More options available to have pets available, we pay a bond and are liable for damage if it happens, so give us the chance "
After 2 x routine 3 month inspections it should change to half yearly if property manager identifies low risk. Rent should not be able to be negotiated weekly. Min should be fortnightly.
The right to give tenant 2 weeks notice to evict -  just as they gave the right to give 2 weeks notice to vacate
More requirements for landlords to improve living conditions
Bullying from real estate agents 
More flexability for tenants. Especially when you have a good proven track record
Be able to hang pictures on walls. Be able to have a small pet.
Sometimes paying the bond can be an issue so other options to do this rather than a one large payment.
Rent control. Not fair moving every 6 mths with continuous short term rental. Puts families at risk. It's disgraceful. 
"Decent Ren t renters are paying mortgage rates on rubbish rentals, water rates the lot"
More helpful real estate agents
"The ability to feel like you can come to a realestate about issues and know they are going to be fixed. 

And to be able to rent a property that won’t refuse us because we have a large outside dog "
Have a central body to oversee all rentals and a uniform process for applications 
I have been judged and denied housing because I have children that is not fair
"A way to systemise communication between renters, real estates, and landlords. Maybe an online platform? That way all the info and communication and requests are in one place."
The cost of rent.. but I guess that just comes with the cost of living I suppose
More properties with pets allowed
Compelling owners to do maintenance work and repairs in timely manner. Even unsafe things have gone unrepaired for years. 
"The criteria for screening applicants needs to be more thorough;
The property managers need to be more qualified; and
The property managers need to understand the difference between a group landlord or a family landlord. This would remind them that to them this is their super, their emotional ownership of the property (even though it shouldn't be, but in this circumstance it is personal to a degree)

The following answers are responded to as an owner"
all rental property to allow pets 
"If there’s an issue with the house, the owners fixing it sooner would be helpful. Not 4 months later or never. "
"Allow more warning time between contract endings. So instead of 2 weeks before the end of the contract, 4-6 weeks would be more realistic."
Being able to make the home your own and having some say. We pay the rent on time every week and yet can’t hang photos. Can’t have cars where we need them. To rent you need to sell everything you have just to please the realestate/ owner I have 20 plus family photos sitting on the ground and it breaks my heart 
More say in when real estate can enter my property for inspections. Allowing pets. 
"When people break their lease or don't look after the property they must pay for it.
All Real estate agents and tenants must insure the property so if they burn it down or damage it the landlord covers it.
If they have pets then their agent or landlord should be able to charge the tenant for its cost.
Also the notice a tenant gives is too long. the bond does not cover the times to go for a urgent application.
Tenants often don't pay the rent for the last 60 days leaving the landlord out of tribunal doesn't award penalties again tenants who do this."
Not to move into someone that still stinks like dog
Better communication with owner. Be able to make changes to the property 
Honesty from estate agents
Bond return when it is fair wear and tear 
Property manager is a lot more polite
Faster response to get things fixed - we have been waiting 10 months 
"Ability to have longer leases (greater than one year) at fixed rates, with tenant ability to leave the lease at, say, 4 week's notice. "
The amount of properties that allow pets
"More responsibility placed on renters and less deferral to owners. At least for long-term occupants, it would be nice to be able to actually live in the space you pay out the nose for. "
Being able to trwat the rental property more like a home
"The price of rent a single parent pays. 
The way maintenance is carried put as I been in my place since June 2018 it's now October and only one thing has been dealt with ."
"Ensure owners and agents are more reasonable about reasonable wear and tear when tenants vacate a property,and as a result not penalising tenants by unfairly deducting amounts from bonds. "
Being able to make the house I live in a real home. Being able to put up pictures. Not having to pay water.
Tradies costs.  I tend to think they charge more because it's an investment property and think landlords are rich and the expense can be claimed back.  I'm not rich - paying a mortgage and you only get a portion of the expense back and are out of pocket in the meantime.
More properties allowing pets 
Real estate agents are unreasonable and rude. The land Lords I have had are also pushing the limits of appropriateness when visiting the property and the eta is unable to do anything about it
Getting things fixed 
"Monthly email from the real estate to ask how everything is, and to give update on body corporate meetings "
Ban smoking in residential buildings to stop smoke drift affecting other tenants
Repairs and maintenance completed when requested. 
Managers of rental units to be more available 
Bond refund in specific days. We have waited over a month more than once while the Realestate agency tried to finalize. 
More certainty about long term rentals
Real-estate support- It feels like they are always trying to make you feel on edge and not supported
"Changing the attitude of the real estate agents, they aren’t the best people to deal with sometimes and property owners need more laws in place with how they have to fix items that require maintenance "
Long term rental - being able to decorate and hang things on walls eg:- dressers 
"Real Estate agents to be held more accountable for properties under their care. Reasonable wear and tear to be clearly defined or gradable, especially where a tenant has been at a property for over 12 months."
" Govt should have more schemes to get people into there own place, rent/buy scheme, deposit assist is not enough for ordinary people on ordinary wages."
"Allowance of dogs above 10kg in properties. If you are responsible, they are no different to small dogs and actually i find they bark less and behave better than small dogs "
Real Estates need to be made accountable 
Stopping the 3 monthly inspections after the tenant has passed 2 consecutive inspections and then change to yearly. Standard rental agreement without agent putting in their extra conditions 
I wouldnt change anything in my behalf I think some of the rta regulations should be changed.
More flexibility with entry notices so tenant can arrange to be home when people enter the house. 
More pet friendly properties for younger people.
Minimum 12 month leases unless specifically agreed to by both parties.
Not having to pay to go to court to defend myself in getting my hond back
Being more able to exercise my rights to have things fixed
Better options provided to tenants for dispute resolution
The house needs to be painted and needs new carpet. So modernising and upkeeping the property would help.
"Quicker response times, or even just acknowledgement of communication between the lessor and the lessee. I often feel unheard and powerless when addressing issues with my property manager and there has been a strong culture of not responding. "
A private site for landlords to advertise renting properties that is not gumtree
Faster turn around time in repair or maintenance jobs requested
Lower rent prices 
"Lower rent cost.
"
More properties where dogs and other pets allowed. Longer leases available 
Knowing more about the house maintenance before moving in many houses have had leaking roof issues 
"There's a few things - owners should not be able to carry out their own maintenance on a property when it requires a contractor.  Tennants should be allowed to put pictures on the walls, Tennants should not have to deal with owners wanting to do non-urgent maintenance at christmas time and holidays - just because they have the time off doesn't mean the tennant should have to change plans.  Long term tennants should not have to put up with the owner suddenly wanting to do all the maintenance after the tennant has handed in their notice - just so they can have a quick turnaround on the property.  No no-urgent maintenance on weekends unless agreed to by the tennant - tennants should not have to have their weekends ruined because owner doesn't want to use a contractor and weekends is the only time they have available.  TICA - tennants should have an avenue of appeal process even if the agent has moved on to clear their name - there are a lot of agents who play nasty and god with TICA and tennants are left nowhere to go.   Tennants should be able to have animals (dogs, cats etc) - I've seen far more damage done by kids than i have by pets.   There needs to be more tenant advocacy groups.  Insulation in properties should be mandatory - in qld there's a lot of war service homes with flat tin roofs - this means no insulation - and none can be put in this then means for the unsuspecting tennant massive power bills.  The qld govt scheme for solar assistance should apply to investment properties as well - that way the tennant would benefit as well as the owner. "
"More small pets allowed, happy to pay extra bond"
longer rental periods
Allowing pets at all tennancies as long as it is reasonable. Not a large dog in a unit for example. Remove water charges. 
"No restrictions on pets in rentals. I understand owners are worried about possible damage, noise and fleas etc. However, it would be good if people could pay a 'pet bond' for the owners' peace of mind. I have pets in my unit and I had to fill out an additional agreement saying that if my pets were too noisy or caused damage, they couldn't be kept at the unit any longer. "
More support on rental exit. Rental agencies will usually find a way to take money out of your bond. 
More ability to have longer leasing periods
"More checks on the agent. We have had a very negative experience with agent. Difficult to deal with, very rigid rules, unpleasant "
The rental agency to allow direct deposits instead of charging a fee for each payment received.
Real estate have a very poor view of renters and are pretty condescending and rude across the board. My husband and I are both professionals in secure jobs with A grade previous rental references and still get treated like scum. It’s a common problem when we speak to friends and family 
Allowing pets in all rental properties.
"Bond return. We recently finished a lease in Nundah (4.5 year lease), finished the paperwork, provided it to the manager and it took the property manager 10 days to sign and return it after multiple follow ups. We had to pay an additional bond on our new property. The value of the old bond should have been held with RTA, we should only pay the difference to the new bond and if monies came out of the old bond, there should be a process in place to collect them from tenant instead of being out of pocket thousands of dollars until the landlord decides to sign the paperwork."
Real estates being less invasive 
Rental affordability  and landlord accountability.
Less restrictions on pets. Every household should allow a pet. Also houses should be inspected by the landlord in between tenant changes to actually see the property to make sure it’s up to liveable standards. They should care about the tenants safety and well being. Not just money in their pockets. 
"There is no recourse for promises made by agents when viewing a property which are not kept.  I know that what ever is promised needs to be captured in the rental agreement, but by the time you have committed to a property you are left with little choice but to continue with the rental even though things don't match up to the sales pitch given at the viewing.  Agents should provide you with a terms sheet upon application which summarises any key features and proposed changes to the property that will be made prior to occupation.  This terms sheet should be a binding part of the agreement with financial penalties to the agent/landlord if not met by occupation date or soon thereafter."
A greater focus on customer service toward tenants.
"Why does rent go up after 6 months of renting?
It's a struggle enough paying 350 a week"
Able to make it more a home
Buy commercial Property
"Freshen up paint before new tenants move in, more communication between landlords and tenants. "
"Having a standard process for applications rather than having to reapply in a different method for different houses. 

Make it easier for people with pets to rent places. "
Quarterly house inspections for good tenants.  6 monthly or yearly for those with good history or keeping the home in good order.
Being treated like dirt from our real estate - not following up issues and queries. 
"Some agents are stupidly thorough when doing inspections. Like looking in all our cupboards, checking pipes etc every 3 months. It's a bit much and unnecessary. Perhaps every 6-12 months would suffice. 

More leniency with hanging pictures on the walls. It's not difficult to patch a wall on exit so I don't understand why we have to ask permission. We are trying to make it our home, hanging art and photos are some of those things that makes it feel like home. It should just say, ""tenants can hang images on the walls but the walls must be patched and repaired where required on exit"". To be honest, we ignore this and just hang up images then patch on exit or use sticky hooks. Never had an issue, but then again we've had some great agents and owners so far. 

Also, requiring dogs to be ""outside at all times"" is cruel and unnecessary. Large dogs or certain breeds to not be allowed on carpeted areas, I would understand. But having a dog is about being part of the family, so asking tenants to keep their dogs outside at ""all times"" is cruel. They don't ask that of cat owners either! My children have caused more damage to the walls, carpet and surfaces than any pet I've ever owned. Would they like them to be kept ""outside at all times""? "
"We need stability and long leases. I would have signed a lease for 2 plus years but as it stands we have to be careful with what we say to our property manager and what maintenance we ask for so that they will renew the lease. And I have a list of things that could improve renting experience... I have been a home owner, a rental property owner and also a tenant."
"when I report a complaint about the house or property to the Real estate, I get NO feed back and the complaint or repairs are never done. I dare not complain about this as I will be tagged a trouble maker"
"Rental prices
Exit inspections"
"security of longer term contracts, having been moved on after a short time a few times... it is expensive and disruptive and takes a lot of time to find a new place, I prefer to rent - long term "
Fairer rules around early termination of leases 
Cheaper rent. More rentals by the government 
No discrimination against pet owners and no preventing renters from having their pets as long as they agree to the extra cleaning and flea treatments at the end of tenancy.
price of renting has gone far to high for small dwelling 
Solar panels on roof without rent increase
Fairness and equality for tenants. 
Having landlords be open to longer lease lengths so we have more security 
"create a state register of excellent tenants that always pay on time and respect the properties that they rent or lease so that prospective landlords and agents can search and find high quality, trustworthy tenants.  Once added to this list, it allows the paperwork to be expedited and not as much paperwork required for every subsequent rental. Unless of course the tenants behaviour changes and then they are struck from the list"
Restrictions on rent increases. So that when you move into a new place the rent that was advertised when you signed in stays in place for a while.
"Having inspections once ever 6-12 months for good tenants, not every 3 month its beyond a joke sometime a specially for working family's."
"Have better contact with real estate agent, I under stand they have lots of tenant's and are busy, but I think they could have better communication with there tenants "
"Pets and hanging pictures - It's silly to not be able to put up pictures, and have to jump through hoops to own a pet. Especially in Queensland, where a large majority of the properties are Queenslanders, with decent yards."
Satisfied to a point. As a renter and low income earner its tough when the rent has to raise each allocated period. I would make netter control of rent rises because it can be very difficult to get a rental in affordable price ranges.
More affordable places that allow pets
More power for tenants to negotiate price and lease
"Pets allowed.
Greater freedom to personalise the space.
And also, why do I always move in to filthy rental properties but if I leave a (for example) single hair behind after bond cleaning, I am called back to fix it? Every single time."
The price it keeps going up 
"I believe in a 12 month lease, 2 only house inspections are required "
"Allowing tenants to treat the property like its their home, allowing pets and being able to hang pictures."
Maintenance is completed when it needs to be. Not just when you get sick of it and move. 
I wouldn’t change anything. It’s great renting in Queensland. 
"Making internet connectivity a priority and a basic right of the tenant, putting caps on how much rent can be charged per share house or home. Regulating share houses more strictly so as not to affect the surrounding area"
Less restrictive ideas of what counts as fair wear and tear. Agents who actually do their job 
"Regular servicing on electrical appliances.. Eg, ovens, hot water system. "
Bond cleans producing a receipt and saying its clean and its not
That the courts actually believe the word of the landlord instead of the tenant
Regulated rent costing and indiscriminate selection of tenants. 
Lower rental prices
the time frames for remedy breeches and evictions mean the landlord loses more money each week that passes
Takes too long to get bad tenants out
"When looking for a property , more flexability in who can view it."
Landlord protection when renters refuse to leave and refuse to pay the rent.
condition reports are not good and need a rework
"Giving more power to the remnants, being able to make small changes such as hanging photos, fixing blinds themselves. Being able to I form the real estate if something is wrong and them ACTUALLY doing something in a timely manner "
"As a tenant, I feel real estates are out to take your bond money. I've rented several houses over the years and only one real estate performed a realistic exit report. Others nit-pick over ludicrous things. And even going as far to make up stories. I look after the house as if it were mine and do not damage it whatsoever. I spent a lot of money on the gardens as well. I think the government needs to do a serious overhaul of these corrupt real estates."
Timelier and free options available when tenants stop paying rent and destroy property.
"More security in renting, I've had to move 4 times in 6 years due to my rental properties being sold.

Renting is expensive."
Stop Real Estates from upping the Rent every 6 months. They do this even within asking the owner. They take advantage of renters not wanting to move. One real estate would only give me 6mth leases and upped the rent by $10 every time. When I left they had to advertise it for $50 less a week because I was over paying rent!
"I’m a long term tenant , inspections once per year instead of every three to four months"
more flexibility.  i.e. ability to do periodic renting and not to be force to sign 12 months contract. 
Streamline the rental application and tenancy agreement process. Take some power away from rental agents. Make property valuations more transparent and uniform so it’s less about supply and demand and more about the actual value of the property.
shouldn't be allowed to rent a property if they expect to sell within the next 2 years
Rollover bond to next property 
Expectation of the condition of housing provided
"Improved communication between property manager/landlord and tenant.
Property managers/landlords having mandatory training around social issues such as domestic and family violence.
Increased anti-discrimination regulations.
Better timeframes for repairs and maintenance.
"
"not being constantly harassed by the real estate agent 3 month before the lease end date to decide if I am renewing the lease, or moving, etc. They basically issue an eviction notice, that can be cancelled if you renew the lease - but its very frustrating and upsetting to say the least."
Lease that is longer than one year.
"more properties with pets allowed
more scheduled maintenance when renting directly with the owner"
Quicker responses to maintenance requests
Water rates should be charged to the tenant the same as electricity.
"The RTA needs more powers to hold landlords responsible for maintaining the property and fixtures according to the legislation at the time so that it doesn’t fall to the tenant to take them to court to make the landlord do something they should be doing by law. It is unfair that as a tenant I have to spend time and money to hold a landlord responsible for maintaining their property when the law already says that they have to.
Property management needs a proper code of conduct and tenants need a place where they can complain about dodgy property managers where their complaints will be upheld and investigated properly."
I would increase the ability of landlords recoup losses  from tenants  and make it easier to evict
Penalise landlords who offer cheap replacement products (that break) or deliver low-quality maintenance to the property (which is then used to counter claim to the tenant upon departure).
Greater controls over tenants having pets and making changes to walls etc. Plus a greater control over issues of non-payment of rent.
There are numerous changes needed.. but the amount of inspections over a 12mth period is absurd. Every 3mths ..and the first one was 2mths in .. im on my 4th inspection and already... and my lease ends in feb.. its intrusive and i dont feel like its home ...for the price i pay .. this is disgusting
Remove the ability of owners to discontinue lease renewal without giving an appropriate reason.
"INspections once a year, similar to NSW, instead of every 3 months which is an intrusion into my privacy and completely ridiculous. "
More info sent regarding RTA processes and tenant rights. It's already good but regular updates and perhaps case-studies would be great.
Increase bonds to cover damage not covered by insurance
"Education and enforcement of 2014 Brisbane Plan regarding what constitutes a ""household"" when renting a Granny flat."
Response time from owner on fixing repairs - some items have been unaddressed for over 7 year now.
Only 2 weeks notice given by tenants where 2 months notice required by landlords.  I think it should be up to landlords whether they accept pets.  Additional measures/ability to remove tenants not paying rent or damaging property
"Ability to have pets at properties without feeling guilt, like you are the worst person in the world."
"The last tenants left the place a mess then stole 800 dollars from my bank account because they wanted there bond and new the realestate wouldn’t give them the bond back, when I spoke to the realestate they said well to bad! They gave me a wrecked unit I can’t even live in it with my 2 year old"
"Allowing the renter flexibility to negotiate inspection times if they aren’t suitable. I had to travel interstate for a couple of weeks for work and an inspection was scheduled during my travel. I requested for the date to be changed with plenty of notice. Instead of the property manager accommodating my request, it was taken as there must be something wrong with property not because I wasn't comfortable with the inspection going ahead with me out of the state. It was a disappointing outcome.  "
"That all private rentals especially on gumtree have had some sort of checking or made sure that they’re in habitable and able to be rented out because I’m about to lose my bond to someone who is dodgy rented main apartment that was uninhabitable by people, After I win off my own back to fix damages that were already at the property so that I’ve got my bond back and now he’s claiming for $50 ding on the fridge it’s unacceptable and I have no rights here and it’s bullshit"
Streamline and speed up the process of eviction of a tenant
"improve accountablilty of rental defaults by tenants. If they leave owing you rent, the process is expenses, time consuming, and once you get a QCAT ruling....you as the lessor have to try enforce it which is futher cost and unsucessful. "
"'More rights for renters:
- Ability to affix things to walls like furniture for safety and pictures.
- Ability for pet ownership to not limit access to rental properties.
- Longer rental terms with more certainty around sale and price.
- Ability for minor landscaping such as vegetable gardens."
Ability to make minor changes to property without consent for every little thing.
The ability to make a house a home. Not even being able to put a picture on the wall or having to ask permission for every little thing is ridiculous 
"The cost of renting, way to high"
All properties pet friendly
Changing the laws in regards to pets and renting 
The many inspections and associated reports that include photos from the real estate agent feel like an invasion of my privacy
"Make it easier to evict tenants who don't pay their rent. 
Allow pets but only with a seperate bond
Allow to charge tenants to have premises cleaned and fumigated properly if needed
"
"Ability to opt out of using rental rewards. I am charged a fee of $1.15 every week when they direct debit my rent because my landlord only uses rental rewards. 

There should always be a fee free option to bpay, direct debit or cheque when paying rent - or those costs should be inclusive of the rent as I have no choice."
Quicker response times to issues of appliances breaking down 
Make it so owners cant force after the initial contract period another. Prefer to move to month to month after that to allow more options when considering moving. Otherwise I’m stuck with what is on the market when considering moving. 
"More pet friendly rentals, choice is really limited if you have a pet. I also find it a bit unfair you can't even hang a picture"
More legislation to protect owners against damage and rent not paid
Tougher laws on real estate and keeping bonds for general wear and tear 
Tenant's must give one months notice if vacating instead of 14 days and owners should only be required to give a tenant 1 months notice if asking the tenant to vacate.
More maintenance on the home by owner
"Pets to be automatically allowed
More options on leases
Being able to hang photos or make reasonable changes to the property "
"Courts to be able to get money owed to lessors from previous tenants or landlords insurance to cover everything.  Lessors are trying to help the homeless and getting ripped off, properties destroyed and lives threatened and no one helps the lessor."
"Have longer rental agreements - 5 years is good, and less frequent inspections if there are no issues with the tenant (every 3 months is too frequent when you're renting long term and there are no problems."
"The real estate I am renting through don't seem to be organised regarding inspections etc.
"
Elimination of landlord's or agent's inspections as well as making all properties pet firendly i.e. the tenant would have right to keep pets in the house 
Honest real estate agents.
More pet friendly houses. Both indoor and outdoor. I have 2 Cats and no kids and a landlord would prefer to have tenants with 2-3 kids but realistically who makes more damage to a house? Cats or kids?
Hardly any places allow dogs. 
Make rental prices cheaper. 
Banning smoking by other occupants in unit blocks.
The tenants have too many rights.  There needs to be more consultation with property owners.
"Having better communication with the landlord, not through a real estate. A house inspection every 2 months is a bit ridiculous and not being able to mount furniture/television on the wall is a safety risk for my toddler."
Any form sent to tenant or agent should be confirmed as recieved  before they become legal.Such as entry notice or breach notice or any form should be confirmed as recieved
Flexible lease terms without reprimand 
Quality of everything in and around the property
Finding out if house is going to be sold while tenancy exists 
"The one thing I would change is being allowed to treat the house I rent as a home. I’m continually reminded that the home I raise my children in belongs to someone else, that it is their investment. I will never own my own home and that is not my fault. Because I rent I cannot improve a property, or even put a hook in the wall.
My youngest has allergies, at my own expense I’d love to pull up the rotting, dust filled carpet and lay vinyl floorboards to alleviate her dust allergy. But I am not allowed to.
In this country only people who own are allowed to have a home, tenants are just here to make owners rich. The house I rent is not my home, it never will be. And that’s not fair. Having lived in Europe I know that tenants are treated much better there."
Having pets being allowed at every property 
The cost of rental properties
"It is often difficult to find a place to rent due to availability, cost and competition from other renters. Therefore it is a big source of stress and uncertainty in my life."
Being able to have a pet. We have had to rehome our beautiful 2 bordercollies due to rental permissions. It has been a trying time for our family losing them.
In times of legitimate financial difficulties..the tenant might be given a period of free rent say 6 weeks based on the proviso that the 6 weeks will be paid back through the period of the rental contract..hopefully taking the pressure of anxiety..that numerous legitimate and loyal tenants might encounter in times of financial difficulties..
All rental properties should contain air conditioning and heating of some kind for the comfort of the tenant. 
Allowing Pets to be at all rentals not just some. Makes it 10x harder to get a house.
Make SOME tenants more accountable for looking after properties
"If you have a good rental history, each Estate Agent should be able to have access to those References.   Bond Money should be able to be transferred from one Rental to another if there is NO outstanding charges or damages.

Photos should be allowed to be hung with the appropriate hooks/3M hooks if damage appears renter to repair.    
Wear and Tear should NOT be charged to the Renter as this happens in any ones home whether you live in it or not.

Estate Agents treat Renters Like human beings and not gutter low class citizens. Treat with Respect.
"
The culture of landlords and rental agents is that tenants are worthless and should be greatful for what they have.
Landlords should have more incentive to carry out repairs quickly
"More Realistic photos of properties, not ones that have been taken to give an illusion or mislead"
To many realestate agents do not do the job they are paid for (or do it poorly) and this impacts both the tenant and landlord.
Better communications between landlords agents & tenants re maintenance
"This is the first time I have rented after selling my house, but so far the experience has been great."
Ability to own a pet more easily
Transfer of bond when ending one agreement and starting another
Not being made to move out prior to end of lease due to selling etc
When leaving a property for Managers/Landlords to give you proper instructions about vactating. Next steps and obviously how the end of tenancy will run. First time renter leaving my first rental a few weeks ago and I didn’t know about 3/4 of the stuff that was required.
Give tenants more rights like Right to Privacy
Freedom to make small modifications to the property eg. Hanging pictures
"owners to have less control with things like pets ,pictures on walls etc"
Advice on average cost of power/water for the units in the complex
"Transparency of landlord requirements for tenants (as in, what type of tenant a landlord is looking for) and faster response to requests for repairs. RTA was unhelpful when I had a dispute and seemed like they only wanted to help the landlord"
The cost of renting is too high. 
One system with the information on from previous renting. Too much paperwork is needed when you have to apply for a rental.
Treatment of tenants by real estate agents
Allow pets in all suitable renting properties. Such as dogs in houses with yards and cats in appartments.
"Make Real estates accountable. They throw all of the hard stuff straight back to the owner. They do nothing to manage your property. Clearly with the turn over of so called ""property managers"" it is just a training ground for the sales team. "
Make renting out a house more attractive to landlords so they invest in their properties.
Security of house pricing when mining picks up. Housing prices rise dramatically in mining towns during mining booms. For example if we were to be evicted from the house we live in (currently paying $310 per week) we would not be able to afford the same size house in the same town during a mining boom (most houses now of this size are $450-$500 per week). We are less secure during mining booms.  
"Maintenance in the home - faster responses from agent, quality of repairs, impact of maintenance costs on rental increases. I currently live with a leaking roof which causes large holes in the ceilings and damage to furniture etc."
"Better avenues for landlords to chase up late or non payments of rent.
As mum and dad investors, we are often scraping money together out of the family budget to supplement the rent, due to tenants knowing they can bea week or two late and the landlords have no legal right to do anything about this."
Greater communication between renters and managers/landlords in relation to the completion of maintenance requests. My experience as a renter is that maintenance requests are not address in a timely manner.
It’s very difficult to find places that allow pets. 
"if you can prove you are a good tenant, move inspections from 3 months to 6 months"
Less pressure to sign long contracts
"Change the rules about returning the bond to the tenant when they are not current with their rent and fail to remove all their belongings when vacating.  Perhaps two types of bonds should be applicable when taking up a tenancy.  One to safeguard damage to the property and another to ensure all personal belongings are removed.  We had a tenant who was provided with the correct order of notice of eviction who failed to keep updated with their rent payments and then just walked out of the property, filling all 3 garbage bins (red, yellow & green lids) with clothing and food.  All their furniture was left behind including beds and a refrigerator!!  Landlords are left with cleaning up the mess.  As a result I will no longer being available to rent out my properties."
"An online system to hold your rental application, so any real estate can access the details required. It is extremely stressful applying for multiple rental properties and every real estate require different criteria (ie. no. of payslips, no. of references, no. of photo ID, some real estates even require bank statements to see what you spend your money on). "
Prices to drop n be affordable
"End no-grounds evictions: As long as a landlord intends to continue renting a property, the rent is being paid, and the property is being maintained, there should be no particular reason that a tenant should be kicked out. There should be a valid reason for eviction, because despite most landlords being agreeable, tenants fear the very few who are aggressive and unreasonable. 

Working for a body corporate management agency, I encountered many first-time landlords and owners who did not understand the level of care required to maintain a physical property. Some, but not all, treated their tenants as if they only needed a place to live that wouldn't kill them. Many delayed remedying major cosmetic or physical defects that weren't dire, but lowered the tenant's quality of life.

People in Queensland cannot treat rentals as their 'homes' for this very reason. 
Those who I worked with did not see the system as one that allowed people to live where they wanted, but instead regarded rentals as inherently dangerous because of the unpredictable nature of many landlords. 

Overall, I have had good experiences, but I consider myself extremely lucky in this regard."
Equality in notice to leave/Notice of Intention to Leave. Tenant only has to give 2 weeks notice they are leaving but an owner has to give 2 months notice if they want them to leave.
Ensure that when a Rental House is sold that the Tenants are not in limbo about their future in the home. 
"1) Solar in rentals is almost not a thing
2) What's allowed to be advertised as air conditioned is outrageous
3) Rentals should not be allowed to deny animals but renters need to be financially responsible for them"
Better qualified professional property managers.
Less frequent inspections
"Pets being allowed in all rentals with no restrictions. If a pet damages a property, then the renter can pay for the damages either out of their bond or pay more."
"I would rather deal with the owners than go through the property managers, waste of time and money."
"I'd like there to be more rental opportunities for pet owners.  My husband and I cannot have children and our dogs are an immense support for us and are as much our family as people.  We live in fear of ending up homeless because if our lease expires on our current rental we will have to choose between giving up our pets, change jobs as well to move where we can find a rental that will take our pets, or being homeless altogether.  It is a very distressing quandary that no person should have to face.  We take very good care of our animals and they are well trained.  We feel discriminated against because we have pets.  Why should the joy and many health benefits of pet ownership be restricted only to those who are wealthy enough to be able to buy their own home?  "
"Tenants should be able to get out of a lease if property is for sale, not fair for tenants to endure inspections with no way out of the lease. Emotionally disturbing, and also more work for tenant. "
"The rent keeps going up and we are paying the same rent as for a brand new house. The house I am renting is 10 years old.
"
being able to make minor modifications such as hanging pictures etc 
"Stonger & clearer legislation to ensure both landlord/tenant comply with their obligations. Currently landlord has upper hand - forces out tenant &/or increases rent.
Stronger requirements for Agents who should be accountable for their incompetence."
"More  assistance for older solo females, solely on OAP.
We really struggle!"
Rental Assistance should be paid directly to the owner or real estate agency.
"12 to 16-weekly inspections! 

Even after living in the same apartment for 13 years (and Real Estate always happy with the way I look after the property)  I continue to get these and I still find them very intrusive. Inspections are unheard of in Germany where I rented my whole life. No one but the tenant has keys to their home."
"Short term leases. Agents try to increase rents after the 6/12 month lease even though the fundamentals show that rents should be declining or staying the same. 
 They are aware of the stress of moving out, find a new place & paying another bond. "
Real estate agents
More options in rental properties for renters with pets
Pets and not waiting over a moth to get things fixed but get them fixed in a couple of days 
If you allow tenants to change the property - to have animals when it is not appropriate then I will simply sell my rental properties and there will be less available
Accountability of property managers 
"An agent's ability to be able to take part of or your whole bond without proper cause and notification. Phony ""this needs fixing"" issues that are bought up after vacating with over expensive price tags to ""fix"" the so called fault they have found is then met with a 'we win, you lose' attitude, bullying and a ""we will bury you in mediation"", ""you won't win"", if you dare to resolve or challenge it attitude. I would ALSO put in a strict CODE of CONDUCT for all property agents. In my experience, many of them hate other human beings, think your the scum of the earth, don't care if you have a nervous breakdown as a result of their behaviour and overall general lack of empathy and compassion. Many of them should not be dealing with other people. IF they dont LIKE you, they make your life a LIVING HELL."
"standard for property managers to behave in a way that provides safe, good living standards for renters. industry is too money/KPI oriented that the person renting the house is disadvantages by poor living standards."
"The communication between the tenant and the rental property owner. Things can get easily misunderstood and rental property owners should have more leeway with tenants. e.g. pets, gardens, etc."
"More stringent rules around entry for prospective buyers so they cannot be abused by real estate agencies (minimum 48 hours notice, requires written confirmation from tenant for approval to enter property, real estate agency cannot take photos or make comment on state of house as it is NOT a rental inspection).
Explain more clearly to rental property owners when/how they are allowed to enter the property so they don't abuse grey zones. We have had an owner try to enter the house to 'inspect flooring' (i.e. entry to inspect completed works on house) that had never been refurbished while we were living on property."
We want solar power. And a pet. But mainly sustainable energy like solar power.
"Allow tenants greater freedom in their rental properties, similar to Victoria's latest changes - ensure they are allowed to hang objects on walls, have (reasonable) pets, etc."
"Not having inspections every quarter.  Once a tenant has lived in the property for a year, and has proved that they're looking after it - cut back on the inspections.  Make them 6 monthly, or even yearly."
The up keep of the house.  The owners don't seem to care about the deterioration of the house. 
"I would personally like to see more options for Rental Retirement Villages, this would help the age pensioner to remain close to like minded people who have been unlucky enough to not own their own home."
I want to feel more supported when requesting repairs to the property which are the responsibility of the Owner. 
Making property managers more accountable for managing properties
Be allowed a pet at any rental
Make tennants more accountable for their behaviour and intentional damage
Tougher penalties for Landlord/realestate breaches
"Clearer legislation and more information surrounding who is liable for costs. Had issues with our previous estate agent claiming our bond while we were in discussions regarding payment. We saw 3 different staff members at the RTA, who all gave us completely different information and advise. "
"My current Renting experience is wonderful however the previous one which we left in January, requires a manager who know what is expected and who can run a complex in the way it was designed."
"People on welfare rental assistance should not be given the money, this benefit should go directly to the landlord."
Allow 2 weeks for entry condition report to be completed by tenant so all problems and faults can be found in a timely manner rather than rushing to fill.out a very important document while you aretrying to move into a property.
"Being able to amend the names on the bond when renewing a lease without it having to go back to market. That should be okay, so long as the other parties sign off and accept it- the bond payment could then be made back in part and names amended. Instead, we renew as it was and I leave with my name still on the lease so that it doesn't run the risk of them having to leave/be kicked out. More and more mid 20's, early 30's are house sharing and in reality this requires for flexibility as people need to move for work and do not always stay in a house for more than 1 or 2 12mo periods."
Minimum lease duration of 1 year unless tenant opts for shorter
More of an opportunity to make the house feel like a home. Having set picture hooks in limited but tasteful areas would eliminate the need for adhesive hooks. Kinder communication/a more personal experience with the property manager & owner. 
A long guaranteed period of tenancy with reason
"To have owners act on maintenance issues, in timely manner."
"1. I did not know that I needed to take out building insurance as part of my rental.  When there was accidental property damage, I was not able to claim on my insurance, and my landlord refused to claim on his insurance.   I was forced to pay more than $2,000 for an accidental damage to a stone benchtop and glass cooktop.  I have been told that renters regularly damage glass cook tops - it is very easy to do, and have to pay for a whole new stove - as I did.  There should be some insurance for accidental damage that I can take out through the RTA to cover me for these things as it is too expensive to take out building insurance for the whole building.  I went to court and there was a woman before me who had to pay $5,000 for replacement to carpet for stains that couldn't be removed - she had children and was forced to pay for the carpet to be replaced. Her kids had accidentally dropped some big pot of something that couldn;t be removed."
Better property managers
"Allow long term lease.  Having only a 6 month lease, with the landlord increasing the rent by 20% every 6 months, or we have to get out and find another place to live where we are still in the 6 month or 12 month max lease time boat.  "
"3 monthly rental inspections are intrusive and annoying
I feel that if you have 2 successful inspections back to back then the following inspections should be 6 monthly"
Easier access to rental properties accepting of pets. 
Faster response to repairs 
Pets allowed in all properties. Fencing installed and secure on all properties. 
Feeling more assured of my rights when dealing with real estate agencies and not fearing retaliation for standing up for my rights.
The ability to put up paintings ect with out having to gain permission if you repair/patch up on exit and leave it in an original state.
Better tenancy management rules
"Categorise weather property could be sold or not! Having 3 year lease options... with conditions.
I have moved 3 times in 3 years because owners are not being honest of their intentions to sell! If I have to move again I think I’ll be put in a looney hospital! 

He tried to put up the rent by $35 & sign a 6month contract 🤓"
"I would allow more rental homes, units and townhouses to have pets in more areas not just in big cities "
the condition of properties offered
Increase the time lines of rental inspection.  Every 3 months is to often and quite insulting as a professional person. 
"Dept of Housing to take more responsibility, consistency and transparency with rogue tenants. They are currently using the excuse its not my job and passing it across to another employee and then passing it on again."
Tenants have to jump through a lot of hoops and really know a lot about their rights to avoid being taken advantage of. I think we need a major simplification of processes and a clear message that tenants have the power to assert their rights without fear of repercussion.
Improved communication with owner/agency.
Cheaper rent & being able to have a pet.
As a landlord I would like to see all rental agreements include an annual CPI clause (same as what commercial property leases generally have).
Enforce the necessity (particularly in Queensland) for homes to have mandatory fans or air conditioners in all rentals.  Thinking about the babies and the elderly.
More pet friendly homes and willingness for owners to fix issues within their properties
Longer lease periods
"More control/checking of real estate agents that don’t do their job e.g. ensuring previous tenants do a bond clean, answering maintenance requests in a reasonable amount of time, take responsibility for their failings instead of trying to tell owners it’s the tenants fault"
"Being able to either a.Tranfer bonds or b. Pay bonds as a payment plan over the first 6 months.
Freedom to have pets 
Freedom to change or add to the premises if needed i.e bathroom towel hooks/rails, add hooks for pictures or shelves etc without causing damage to within reason or build a carport or shed or stable or arena or round yard or add fencing if wanted on acerage properties. 
Also reduce rents for some as there are extreme rental prices out there and for the average joe these aren’t realistic, making areas we would prefer to live in impossible"
Less biased towards renters owning a cat
better rights for renters
More rights for tenants.  My wife and I have been renting in Queensland for over 20 years now and have never missed a rental payment or had an improvement notice of any kind yet we are still subjected to 3 monthly inspections.  A star rating of tenants to reward you for good practice that then comes with tangible rewards such as less inspections or reduced process in the application of a new rental would encourage good behaviour.
The exit bond report as I've  always left cleaner than moving in and the agents still go out of their way to find a fault even if you have lived at that address for over 5 years with no maintenance 
"Nothing, really. I've had good experiences... but they were all a while ago."
"The Lessor should be able to require the tenant to pay for goods and services ie. carpet cleaning, pest control, pool chemicals"
Make tenants more liable for the damage and misuse of properties. Some tenants have no respect for properties.
Identifying internet serviceability on rental advertisements.
More pet friendly rentals. It is extremely hard to find these properties and so many people are competing for them.
For agents to fix the property when problems arise and not takes months to do it.
"I live alone and would love to own a pet but it's forbidden by the body corporate
Repairs are often not carried out
I would like the opportunity to have a longer term lease
I find the regular inspections intrusive as I've lived in my unit for over 10 years and don't think it's necessary any more"
"More rights for owners when tenants do not pay rent or damage the property. And quicker ways to get them out! 
A more accessible black list for problem tenants that private landlords can easily access. 
More accountability for real estate managers. 
More incentives to buy an investment property and keep it rented. 
"
"I realise things cost money for the owners but if something is done to one property then it should be all. I live in a duplex, the other side got a fence and gate but it’s my place that everyone goes through but I am unable to put anything up. Plus the cracks in the walls since the cyclone nearly 4 yrs ago "
Nothing at present. The rules seem clear and fair for both the landlord and the tenant.
"Affordability of rentals and the conditions of the properties they expect you to live in. In my experience, the cheaper the rent the worse the condition of the property. "
Financially viable long term options or longer leases
Laws need to be balanced to protect both tenants and landlords- at present tenants are favoured
Inlist a different Management company - Tessa is utterly useless
To be able to hang up the family pictures of our son to be able to have a dog to be able to put a screen door on the carport doorway to stop snakes
Stopping the rent getting to ridiculous pricing that is not affordable to people.
Make it easier to have pets
"The leaving a rental process is necessarily stressful and favours the owner. Estate Agents treat it like a relationship break up and the standards they hold tenants to in the inspection to return the bond is very stressful and too heavily favoured towards the landlord/agent. It is unfair, especially if you have lived in a place many years, had regular quarterly inspections without any issue, yet when you leave they try and withhold the bond for all manner of trivial issues that have never previously been raised. I also find the onus is on me upon move in to capture every small defect prior to my arrival, otherwise it gets pinned on me when I leave. You dont have the time to fine comb a place and take pictures of every defect when you also are moving and have alot on"
"Hard to find homes that are dog friendly. 
"
"Much more owner protection. 
My house was badly damaged with full insurance and the Ombudsman did nothing to help my investment security even with appeals "
"The power agents have to determine what is damage vs wear and tear. The power agents have to rent out as property that is dirty, but expect it to be spotless at the end of the lease."
Reduce rent amount 
The option to keep pets and be able to conduct minor renovations on the apartment (at the tenant's expense)
The cost is very high when compared to my income
"More transparency regarding rent increases and reporting to a governmental authority. I've hear of friends being charged EXORBITANT yearly increases for no benefit other than the owners pockets. It's criminal.

Also, more protection for fair and responsible owners when a renter fails to pay their rent. My mother is going through a very trying experience with her single rental investment property right now, she's having to dip into her super to cover costs. Very stressful."
Less inspections..surely you know after 4 or 5 inspections how I live!!
Property managers/real estate agents ability to tie up bond money unlawfully
"Privacy - I have had the real estate hand out keys to our house without our permission to contractors they found on gumtree. I also am very uncomfortable with them videoing the inside of our house when undertaking inspections as they should only need to document/video damage, not go through our house recording our personal space. Finally, bringing people through your house prior to moving, they are not watching everyone and we have had things go missing."
Maintenance requests completed 
Be allowed to put a screw or two into the wall
Make it easier to find a suitable place with pets. 
Change laws to ensuring tenants can sign a new lease conditional on rent being paid and no property damage. Whilst still giving landlords the ability to end leases if selling or conducting major renovations 
Reducing rent prices
More support for pets and hanging things on walls. Existing seems they all want it exactly as it was on entry. Whether there for one year or ten. Unfair. No agent or landlord accepts fair wear and tear in my experiences. And I am an excellent tenant 
The process for receiving a Bond back.  I lived at an address where the onsite manager came up with the most petty things to dock my Bond.  It is the only time I have not received my Bond back in full.
Hold tenant more accountable for rent loss; cleaning; damages 
Longer renting agreements. 
Stronger rights to the owner 
There needs to be a system and better punishment for realestates who go against legislation and there needs to be better rewards for realestates who are professional and respectful.
"I am very lucky to have a landlord that allows me to look after my 2 cats. Finding somewhere to rent that allows pets is extremely challenging. I volunteer at the RSPCA, and I would say at least 30% of animals I see come with the surrender reason 'landlord won't allow'.
Pet owners are generally responsible and law abiding tenants. If a pet bond would make investment property owners feel more at ease, I'm sure most pet owners would be more than happy to pay it to ensure the safety of their animals. 
Having pet bonds would promote an open conversation between tenants and landlords, rather than tenants trying to sneak in pets or hide them during inspections, which would be stressful for all parties involved. "
Less invasive tenant screening. 
"The racism of the real estate agents. I've applied for houses to be told they are taken, when they haven't been. It was a way of keeping me out. Clear details, stating no young children or teenagers, no pets etc"
More pet friendly housing available 
Increase the availability of good quality housing that allow pets. We found it nearly impossible to find a place that would allow us to have a dog.
Longer leases on the European model 5-10 years. I have been forced to move after 12 months and moving a family of 5 is an expensive exercise. I would be happy to adopt other parts of the Euro model e.g. installing own kitchen appliances if this made things easier. 
extend rental leases by more than 12 months to insure security of tenure
Quicker responding times to e-mails
Understanding of life issues that affect renting
"knowing that regular checks are done on essential maintenance e.g. electrical wiring, gas lines or water pipes."
Find more renting houses that allow pets. Leasing contracts greater than one year (2 or 3 years for example).
I've never had a bad renting experience so I can't think of anything I would change.
"Allowing pets , owners not being able to kick you out if problem is being fixed, respect from real estates "
Allow owners to decide not renew leases with one month's notice 
"Better communication, organisation and management from real estate agents. 
Better ways to deal with bad real estate agents. 
Longer leases, less rent rises.
More rights to make minor changes. "
"Restrictions placed on us as tenants, we have been renting for over year and cant make the place feel like our home. We are also looking to buy so being tied into a lease makes it expensive to co-ordinate buying as we will be penalised when we move out. There should be an ability to move on if we give reasonable notice without being penalised e.g 2 months notice"
Clearer laws and explanations
Tenants seem to believe they can do what they like to their rental property often having it untidy/damaged with little the landlord can really do to prevent this.
Quicker action to have maintenance/issues attended to.
"Mandatory locks with keys on bedroom doors
Also allowing pet owners to not be rejected because they have an animal"
"Better communication with rental property owner. I'd love to do more to improve especially the gardens and landscaping of the property but it is always a hassle to get things like that sorted through the real estate agent.
"
"The property managers should communicate better.
Big issues eg: toilet not working should be fixed within 24 hours not 6 weeks.
On the Gold Coast, the real estate works in the owners interests not the tennant."
"Queensland has a huge supply of high set homes built from early 1900's-1980's that people have built in underneath, most of these are just shy of the 2.4m requirement for fire and safety. I would like to see the law changed to allow these areas to be utilised as bedrooms with the requirement of smoke alarms and easy exits in each room occupied. (this is probably more of a legal matter than rental, but thought it was worth noting)

Periodic Leases: Tenants can give two weeks notice without grounds yet owners have to give 2 months notice without grounds, I feel this is unjustified and gives favouritism to tenants

The property should remain in the condition the tenant received it and property managers should have more rights when enforcing these rules, especially in front of the courts. 'Hardship' is becoming too common with tenants and owners are the ones that have to suffer because of the leniency shown to tenants"
More timely help when maintenance issues reporting to property manager
"Final inspections of property upon exiting are far too stringent. In one property we lived in, there was only 1 layer of very cheap paint on the walls. Overtime, the paint wore because of the bed leaning against the master bedroom. We were told we had to have the wall repainted when realistically it is general wear and tear. There should be an independent assessor (other than the real estate agent) to actually completes the inspections. 

Also, greater leniency towards pets being accepted into properties. "
"Pet acceptance
Landlords renting history - would be good to get an idea if the Landlord is dedicated to a long term investment. I have moved 3 times now after 1 year periods due to landlords selling or moving bk in to a property and had to suffer the moving costs and re-connection costs every time."
Rental bonds are not sufficient- lost rent and damage can cost so much more than a bond amount and leave landlords in desperate financial trouble
More flexibility in customizing the house to my own experience.
The opportunity for a long term lease (several years). 
"House inspections are too close together. Every 6 months is less of an invasion of privacy.  Allow tenants to have pets, this makes it a lot easier to find a rental properties with pets."
To be allowed pets at all rentals and not have to wait for a board/owner to approve you just based on having a pet. 
Maintenance to be a mandatory requirement. 
More rights to protect renters

Applying for properties with Dogs & Cats.
Tenants privately renting in unit blocks should be notified if the Landlord decides to take part in the scheme to give subsidized rental to people from the Housing list. To help shorten the Dept of Housing list.
Being able to have my well behaved pets allowed in all rental properties that are appropriate in size and have a secure yard or pet proof balcony in the case of  high rise apartments.
"The attitude of Real Estate employees. They do not treat you like a customer, they treat you like you should be grateful to have a rental property and hold you to ransom.  "
I was told the house was fully insulated before signing the contact. I was then told I was not allowed to move the man hole cover or view inside the roof. I have discovered the house isn't insulated at all but there is nothing I can do about it. I have even offered to pay for insulation to be installed but the realestate agent wont even offer that to the landlord. My kids now suffer and I cannot afford to move as I'd loose my bond for leaving early. Such an unfair situation. 
Online access to payment ledgers
"Bonds should be able to be transferred, adjusted, etc, when moving home as the process is already financially stressful when moving home, having two bonds submitted (new and the one pending return) is ridiculous.

Having less routine inspections as they are invasive into the person's privacy when not at home."
Better communication between agent and tenant 
One standardised application form for all Real Estate agencies.
Be able to hang up pictures
Better quality tenants
Reforming real estate agent behaviour

Pets need to be available for more properties at a reasonable rental price
less inspections. Trained property managers who are trained to assess a property upon handover.
Owners have more rights. It’s their investment. Their money to secure their future. Tenants shouldn’t be able to gamble with this. 
"Pressure on renters by real estates. They have the absolute upper hand and do everything to make your life a nightmare, from raising rent prices at times that are unfair, to pushing tenants around. It's horrible to be a renter in Qld. "
Having pets allowed in more rental properties 
"Honesty and Openness with relevant information by property managers. My landlord is a person who has a history of violent offences. The property manager knew my landlord well and his history yet failed to inform me. I would not have rented the property had I known as I obviously want to shield myself and my family from harm. I am sure if the tables were turned and I was the one with the violent past, the property manager would not hesitate to tell the landlord.  "
Less power to property managers and owners and more to the people actually having to live in the rental property
Wheelchair accessible and usable housing.  Allowing a person to have a pet that is so important to a disabled person as sometimes they are their only family.  I have seen rental properties severely damaged by children.  My cat doesn't damage anything and has it's own cat run.
"Rules around pets, I have an indoor only cat, most landlords expect you to keep it outside which is both illegal and unsafe at night and makes me uneasy during the day."
Would like to be able to hang some pictures/paintings so it feels less sterile.
Better interaction between real estate/home owner/renter 
The lease commitment is not effective as there are virtually no penalties for breaking a lease. We have tried to claim on damages with the RTA with very little result. We as owners always end up out of pocket by considerable amounts. The current laws are mostly on the side of the tenant with little support for the owners.
longer term rental contracts.
"It's hard to get to open house inspections. Realtors want people with jobs to rent houses, but inspection times outside office hours are so limited.

Renting with pets limits our options so much, despite taking care of properties as well as any other tenant.

Realtors can just make their own rules about inspections - our first inspection at our new property was 3 weeks after we moved in, and this was after having tradesman after tradesman come in to fix the various issues that previous tenants had left, which was very disruptive and upsetting for our dogs who were already confused about moving house."
More properties being pet friendly
"I believe that tenants (esp. long term tenants) should be able to treat the house that they are renting as their *home* for the duration that they are living there, so long as they take responsibility to return the house to the state that they received it when they vacate. This includes having pets, hanging pictures, digging gardens, painting walls, making small adjustments etc. So long as walls are repainted back to neutral colours and all adjustments etc. are repaired prior to vacating the property."
A faster process in dealing with QCAT when necessary
"Recognising the value of renters. I feel we are treated very poorly with no consideration, and there is no clear avenue to call on for advice or support without going expensive legal route."
I would change the procedure to make sure the person paying the money is treated like the client and the person with the product for rent is a supplier.
"I'd love to be able to make it more of a home - hang pictures, make improvements and have a pet. Especially has i have rented long term. "
Landlords need to do maintenance.
For Agents to take on board the issues and problems tenants have.
"Greater repercussions for not auctioning maintenance requests, with protection for tenants from retribution for maintenance requests when ending lease agreements.   "
That real estate agents and owner help with relocation if owners wants to sell
Building inspections on homes over say 30 years old. 
Easier to rent with pets
Tenants need to take more responsibility for maintenance of home as current setup discourages rental investments.
Clearer guidelines around renters responsibility and owners responsibility when it comes to repairing parts of the house.
"at the moment, it would be the renting agents - they expect cleanliness at all times, and as I have a cat they query any stains on carpets even though they are stains that were already there when I moved in."
Property Managers trying to impress landlords by ripping off tenants and pets.
The ability to place items on the walls to make the space more 'homely'
Allowing tenants to hang pictures
Improved background and reference check on tennants
"More power to the renters. Our property manager is great, but the complex owner is terrible. "
Owners and rental managers should realise that for the majority of renters do look after the properties and maintain  and present them in a good manner and alot of the time increase the value
To be able to transfer the bond over rather than having to pay for it and then getting the previous bond back.
Find a decent place for much less.
Given notice to leave with no valid reason by owners
It was fair when renting. I expected to abide by the constraints of the landlord/agent and had no problem.
"Being able to contact the landlord / tenant directly, rather than exclusively via the real estate agent - who don't *always* seem to have the best interest of either the landlord or the tenant in mind. It could be via some kind of portal where the tenant, landlord and real estate agent communicate so contact details such as email or phone numbers are not necessarily exchanged.  "
"I understand that renting with pets is a contentious topic in Australia. I feel the subject leans very much in the property owners favour, and perhaps there needs to be some discussion on new framework that treats the subject more fairly. Should a small bird be treated like 3 cats or a large, barking dog? I don't believe so. So perhaps at the very least renters should be about to open a dialog with the property owner and have some options/rules to cover both parties. People love their pets, they consider them friends and family members. Renting in Brisbane is extremely expensive, the properties under $400 p/w within reach of the CBD are often very disappointing (dirty, old, run down, tiny). If you want happier, healthier citizens, let them live their lives easier and with more of their own control. This is just one tiny piece of the puzzle."
government controlled rent
Allowing pets in all rental properties 
Less nasty agents
Lorndlord should be forced to maintain the property.
Would be amazing if if all investment properties available for rental had compulsory solar power and battery storage. good for the environment and would severely help with cost of living stresses
When moving into a new house being able to transfer the bond from one place to another .. real estates all refuse to do this and it makes it expensive when you have to move .. also when things need fixing the real estate should be on a time constraint to fix it 
"I would like to see a rewards program for the people that pay their rent on time, don't destroy property and actually improve their HOME. "
Quicker response to maintenance requests
More pet friendly housing 
"Constantly chasing the agent for action on things and feel that I am managing my own property.
I feel there is a gap in entry condition to now however the agent says they are looking after  it well. It doesn't take much to mow for an inspection. Feel like the agent is certainly on the tenants side.
Feel as though the tenants can do as they please like it is their own property and not run things by the owner or agent. we have had fencing altered items we have left cut or altered and paddock vegetation mowed so short it is now dirt etc."
The government to introduce affordable rent to buy scheme 
Household repair times with real estates..to slow 
"Longer standard rent form and an improvement in tenant rights. e.g. landlord can bascially kick one out with very little notice, yet we must agree to a fixed term or help with advertising costs if we choose to leave early. Doesn't seem fair/equal. "
The frequency and expectation of the inspections.
"Rental expensive, could reduce rentals"
More consultation with property managers and there agents I have lived in my property for 3 months and have not yet received copy of lease or entry condition form. They do not answer emails and after phoning to remind them still nothing gets done.
The ability to adopt a pet would make renting a more pleasant experience. 
"When a request is made to be at home for routine inspections, it should be honoured."
The regulation around real estates. They can be quite unorganised. 
Letting agents that are more responsive to their stakeholders. Renters are also customers.
Making it equal and fair across the board.  Different Estate Agents have different rules about renting and what is required as well as different people within the same agency having different standards and expectations when a tenant leaves a property.
Immediately empower tenants with the rights to both own pets and make minor modifications to their households.
Allow long-term tenants to make minor modifications and improvements.
Less unit inspections
"Pet ownership, and frequency of house inspections to be reduced from 3 months to 6 monthly after a period of satisfactory inspections.
Further, I have experienced multiple times owners turning up to the property unannounced with no written notice, and real estates not enforcing the notice period with the owners, no advocacy for tenants from most real estates.
Further, I have had to call the council on one owner due to mold growing, and the council found that the amount of windows etc were illegal.
Tenants are often treated with such snobbery from real estate agents and staff, it's noticeable, that renters are treated as less of a human being quite often.
I was previously a home owner, I'm a post graduate student and professionally qualified person. Yet I have noticed how condescending many real estate staff can be in interactions with tenants.
There seems to be very very little respect for the rights of tenants, or recourse of action where owners or real estates have repeatedly breached the tenancy agreement.
For example, I reported being electrocuted by the laundry power point when I had turned off the switch to the real estate approximately three times, with no response or electrician attending. I had to contact the RTA and seek advice, and then advise the real estate that I had contacted the RTA and as the repair was considered emergent, if no one attended at the residence to attend to the issue, I'd be contacting the listed electrician in the emergency contacts by the following day.
An electrician attended that afternoon.
Another example, I have been renting where I am residing for over 2 years now.
I have never failed an inspection, and after one year of passing inspections without any issue, it becomes quite inconvenient to have three monthly house inspections, with career/study/family commitments.
In addition, I had reported three or four times that we had issues with our hot water running out within approximately 30 seconds of turning it on.  This took about six weeks to have someone attend, and our water bill noticeably reduced following the replacement of the hot water system.  In another rental property, the hot water tank was obviously leaking, and again the owner decided to put in a cheap, small hot water system, and our water bill was high due to a failure to repair the issue in a timely manner.  I believe with issues like this that there should perhaps be some more responsibility placed on urgency of repairs and where owners or real estates have failed to repair these issues in a reasonable time frame, a responsibility to foot some of the bill.
The cost of renting privately has become quite excessive in many areas, and the frequency of increasing the cost of rent has also been alarming for some people with limited incomes.
With regards to pet ownership, my children, spouse and I all love pets.  I understand that large dogs, or male cats or large parrots etc can be extremely destructive to a property.  However I find it extremely unfair that even Department of Housing allows pets, but private renters are for a large part not even allowed to own a small bird or fixed and registered cat or small dog. My background is 10 years as a Registered Nurse, previously studying towards a Masters in Wound Care. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated the health benefits of having pets both psychologically and physically, and I honestly believe that the quality of life for many is reduced due to the refusal of owners to allow even small pets for tenants.
For example, I am careful to obey the rules of the tenancy agreements, whereas I am well aware of MANY tenants who just hide their pets anyway.  
Here are some links to journal published studies regarding the health benefits of owning pets (including lower resting systolic blood pressure, increased likelihood of surviving myocardial infarction).  Further, animal therapy is commonly utilised in aged care homes with positive effects for residents.

Further, the tenancy agreement could quite easily be adjusted to place all repairs caused to damage due to pets to be placed squarely at the feet of the tenants who fail to keep the pets well managed."
"Longer term rentals, need less housing inspections, every 3 months seem excessive if you've been renting the same property for a while.  Also we found there is a long delay in the repair process. for example our aircon broke the week before Christmas 2017 and wasn't fixed until late February 2018."
"Our Body Corporate visitor parking rules do not comply with Qld standard guidelines, so only trades people can park in visitor parks. Anyone who is an invited guest cannot even let their car stand there for a few minutes. The body corporate acknowledges wording id not clear but refuses to change it."
"I am a property owner/manager, I feel the tenant needs to be more open and honest about the pet situations. My property is 4 years old and after the last tenants it looked 20 years old. Each time I have agreed for pets to be a part of the lease it has caused surmountable damage and out of pocket expense. I take pride in giving a tenant a clean home to live in and each time it has been my time off work and cost to bring it up to standard again. No tenant has fixed this so I think it should be up to the property owner if they would allow pets.  owner if "
Better customer service
Owners caught taking their house off the sale market to get renters in and then relisting for sale after the 3 months grace should be made to pay the moving costs of the tenants should the tenant choose not to stay because of sale inspections invading privacy and causing anxiety about the possibility of having to move again. If owners take a house off the market and put tenants in to make money while they sell then they should pay compensation for the removalist cost and inconvenience to the tenants that they blatantly take advantage off. I have moved into houses and after 3 months or 5 months there been told that I have to put up with sale inspections despite expressing my needs to the rental agent that I specifically want 5 years or more tenancy. It costs about $2000- $3000 to move house (particularly hard for single parents). It's easy to catch them out doing this. My neighbours told me that a house had been up for sale for 3 years through multiple different agencies. The owners just kept putting in tenants through one agency and listing for sale through another. 
The relationship with the owners and Real Estate in regard to timely maintenance and security issues.
Timely maintenance and upkeep done on older properties. Better agent transparency with repairs and owner contact 
Easier to rent with animals and landlords should already have set hooks on walls for photos - the sticky ones fall off so I don't bother hanging my pics anymore 
the application process can be tough often with no feedback (particularly on why you may be unsuccessful on being selected for a property). It would be nice to know reasons for an unsuccessful application. 
"Being given the chance to arrange routine inspection times around a time you (as the tenant) could possible be home; it just feels intrusive someone coming into your house when you are not home, and them using the key to gain access. 
"
Tenant needs to be responsible for lawn maintenance not just mowing the lawn prior to inspections.
Automatic approval of pets
"Our managing agents taking noise complaints against other tenants seriously. In the apartment buildings we’ve lived in, if an owner-occupier makes loud noise which disturbs other occupants, the agents and building management aren’t willing to do anything about it. In our current building, our agent actually said it wouldn’t be any owners slamming doors or leavng rubbish outside the rubbish chute. We’re treated like we’re inferior to owners."
"Better protections, e.g. asking for improvements (ie replacing a 30 yr old stove, checking the safety of a balcony) without the possibility of not renewing a lease or having a rent increase."
That the owner carries out maintenance on house when issues are raised at each inspection.
The rent amount is to high 
pay there rent keep it clean and tidedy
Not having severe or too frequent rent increases
More professional personable realestate agents. Having a standard of cleanliness when moving into a home.
More understand for property managers and owners 
Wait longer for a real nice tenant.
"Pet ownership for tenants. A pet bond could be proposed to protect investors, but people should not be banned from having pets. "
Make tenants more accountable for looking after the home without the stress of going into dispute
"Fewer inspections
Something in return for annual rent increase"
An understanding that the owner of the property has more rights than those they choose to lease the property to.
Legislation preventing landlords making unreasonable rent increases or refusing to make repairs required
Give landlords more confidence in government and stop threatening to take away negative gearing. At the moment we rent our properties out quite cheaply and don’t break even. If negative gearing was obolished we’d increase rent and not be so accommodating to the elderly ladies we look after through renting our properties to them. They are happy and so are we. A change would impact society. 
Get rid of 6/12mth contracts and have perodical leases instead like in Europe. Property Managers of Real Agents should be watched by an independant body as they are not doing a good job for the tenant and the landlord. I have had many unsatisfactory experiences with then in the past. The rent should be capped depending on the state of the house/apartment.
Being able to hang photo's and pictures on the walls. Being able to have a pet if we wish.
not renting atm i am a landlord
Silly question. It’s up to the Real Estate Agents and Building Managment to change.
Cost of rent per week could be lowered to more affordable prices.
lower rent prices
The process for finding a new rental property  - the short lead times are so stressful and the property descriptions are usually way off reality.
Would be good if there were more rentals available and pets were allowed if you have good referenced
landlords paying more attention to security.  longer leases like up to 5 years.
I think lot of rules are in favour of home owner or property agency. Renter doesn't have any right and still continue to pay rent even if condition of house is not good anymore or they are given option to leave and find new house which is not only a big monetary loss but time consuming and draining as well.
More equal power balance between real estate and tenant 
Give the new tenants access to information about repairs the previous tenants had to address to prevent every subsequent tenant having to fix the same damage as a result of a design flaw in the premises.
To feel safe that the system will protect me quickly and effectively if the people renting my house are damaging it or will not leave even though they are not paying rent.
"Landlord was very invasive, did not respect privacy during inspections. Property manager was not able to manage their expectations. House was kept immaculate all of the time."
Providing more rentals that accept Pets 
Change rental agreements to provide for long term rentals eg 5 years.
Owners do not carry out necessary maintenance
Better contact with property managers
"I'd like a stove in my kitchen. My landlady was told when building the Granny flat, that if she put a stove in the kitchen it would increase her insurance payments dramatically. So she put the stove in the adjoining laundry, which is no linger working. There is a  plug-in two ring electric plate in the kitchen."
More communication between the landlord and the tennent.  Especially around the resigning of a lease.  My landlord waited until the last minute to reply to my offer of a rent reduction (which they initiated to get us to resign) and then didn't agree to my reasonable offer.  This didn't leave a lot of time for us to find another property and move out to a very similar apartment where rent was cheaper.  I feel we were tricked into resigning with them.  And they also added water charges into our lease at the last minute.
Better response times to repair issues
Should be able to leave at anytime when property is for sale. Should be allowed a small dog.
whenever something nd to fix hav to b fixed don't delay it
"More bond, prepay cleaning services. Landlord rights"
The capacity to evict house damaging tennants.
The frequency that a landlord can conduct inspections and enter the property is intrusive. There is no requirement for the landlord to make a suitable time and they just enter the house regardless of what our circumstance may be.
"Allowing harmless pets
Lower renting cost"
"Allowing the tenant to live as if it was their own home.Pets, hang pictures, etc "
Less rigid rules around not receiving bond back after general wear and tear. 
Have the ability to rent for longer duration to allow you to feel that its a home and you have security.
Permission to to allow one neutered small dog and/or cat.
Better communication from the Real Estate Rental Manager
The laws on allowable rooms to be let
Real estate Agents treating us better
Cheaper rent but still decent housing and location
Landlords must disclose any major issues with the property-specifically health issues such as black mould before lease is signed.
Reducing the inspection periods by agents from every 3 to 4 months to every 6 to 12 months.
Tenants wishing to leave property should give more than 2 weeks notice when I have to give them 2 months.
Better communication between us and our Real Estate
Allowing people to have pets and to cut the price down to be more affordable so people who rent can do some sort of saving plan.
"Rental Security and bad agents. Renters have very little in the way of long term security and rights when it comes to renting. You are constantly wondering if you are going to be evicted at the end of your lease, and there is no recourse if they do decide to refuse renewal. As such, it makes it hard to settle down. You always wonder where you will be living next, feel like you might be evicted if a landlord or agent doesn't like you, and you are afraid of reporting problems in case you rock the boat. If the owner decides to sell, you are expected to constantly have the house in a prepared state for inspection and inspections can be a weekly event with only 3 days warning. Getting an agent to uphold the terms of the contract often requires threat of the RTA and at times I have been asked by an agent to provide them with documents they themselves are responsible for managing. If you have a bad agent, you may only get a warning the night before an inspections which they may not show up to anyway. "
"Long term leasing for more security in housing. More flexibility in making the home feel like yours eg. being able to paint walls, gardening, shelving, photos on the walls, air conditioning."
How the real estate and owners treat there tenants.  Mainly the real estate.  I understand that they are protecting the owners property but the attitude with some property managers is less than appealing.  Photo's of the house is a direct disrespect of privacy as well.
Able to remove poor tenants quickly 
Better customer service by ray white and real estates mangers.
Owner willing to do repairs when needed
Property well maintained/locks working/tested on drug abuse/allowed to hang photos+pictures/help with nbn/immediate action in case of drug abuse/violence by other tenantd
"Able to have pets
Able to change the rental decor ensuring it’s returned to its normal state after. E.g. hanging artwork, changing light fixtures etc "
Less restrictions on pets in rentals.
"Higher bonds to protect landlords. Bonds need to be at least 6 weeks worth of rent because it takes a minimum of 3 weeks to be able to remove a tenant from the property if they fail to pay the rent, not to mention if there's damage/cleaning to be done.

QCAT needs to evict tenants faster if it is obvious that they are taking advantage of the landlord and system. QCAT takes over a month to hold a hearing and then allow tenants to stay for a month or more even when they are behind on rent. This is a real financial burden on owners. "
"Lower Council Rates as they are out of line with other states. eg I pay $2500 per unit whose market value is $145,000 in Cairns yet pay $2500 for a house whose market value is $1.1million in Melbourne Victoria.
 Similarly BC fees are very high and keep on increasing because tenants expect and demand improvements to common areas eat."
I think that all carpets and upholstery needs to be professionally cleaned prior to taking on an apartment.
Holding owners responsible for safety standards in the homes they rent out. 
Less routine inspections for long term tenants.
Improve protections for landlords when they have to deal with bad tenants.
"Lease terminations should be equal. ie, Not 2months and 2 weeks"
Allow good tenants to transfer bond from one rental to another. We are currently paying $460 week which goes up every year we are retired and live on DVA we can find a much cheaper rental but coming up with new bond is impossible we have $1840 in bond so far we have been in current house for two years our landlords thank us for being great tenants yet we are stuck please help
I would change more consistency amongst real estates in the way they follow the legislation. Also a minimum standard living conditions as some properties are not safe or habitual but owners won't spend money on maintenance.   
If you are a good long term tenant inspections 2 of 3 times a year should be enough. To add to this I always feel uncomfortable when photo's are taken. It always feels like such an invasion of privacy to have some one come through your home when you can not be there.
"The ability to have longer rental periods, with approval for making cosmetic changes to the property to make it your own. "
more availability for longer leases
"Having access to the owners mobile number incase the real estate property manager isn""t doing his/her job properly which results in the tenant not having their rights adhered to."
I don't think body corporate should be able to ban pets. I have no say unless I challenge body corporate. Why should that be the default for me?
More pet friendly rentals
"Availability of rentals allowing pets to live there.
"
The property manager seems to work for the tenants and don't tell you when they are weeks behind so you can't breach them as generally by the time you do find out the tenants have caught up.
More honesty from agents re: damage at the end of the lease. They seem to be only out to take your bond despite all the proof of existing issues.  
"Page 6 Pocket guide for tenants. 
Fixtures can only be added with the property owner/manager’s written consent. REMOVE ""and they do not have to agree to the request if they give a good reason"". 

Page 7 Pocket guide for tenants. 
Sub-letting and co-tenancies If you want to rent out a room or part of the property, you must seek written permission from the property manager/owner. Check your tenancy. REMOVE ""and they must have good reason to say no"". 

"
"Less inspections after 1 year tenancy, owner to provide wall hanging options and respond to maintenance quicker."
Get a landlord who is willing to work with you when problems arise at the rental property.
The property managers are all friends with you till you sign lease then you are a number and they do not care about you. There is no customer service at all.
Allowance for pets after renting for a period of time with no complaints etc
I would like the people renting the house to be made responsible for pest control & full cleaning upon leaving.
"More screening processes
RTA forms that include detailed descriptions of notice periods i.e. 2 months notice is 2 calendar months not 8 weeks etc. "
Improved access to longer-term lease agreements with fixed conditions.
The ability to drop quarterly inspections down to biannual inspections after two years of renting a property if there have been no issues on your behalf in terms of not damaging the property.
To have rental agencies treat tenants with a bit of respect and consideration.
"Legislate solar panels on all rentals. Pets allowed, mandatory repair timeframes."
more allowances for pet ownership
In my opinion all rentals need to be managed by a registered property manager and not directly by the owner. This ensures the property is managed in accordance with tenancy rules & requirements rather than the owners agenda or personal preferences. 
"As a landlord, more access to previous rental records for the rental managers. We had previous experience with a tenant who mistreated our property, but was then able to move on and rent another property without disclosing their previous rental history in our property."
Rent is too much.  It needs to be reduced by at least $100 per week.
Cost of renting is in excess of the average wage. Cost of housing goes up everytime the First Home Owners grant comes into effect (due to Real Estates increasing house prices). Also with 7 children we have almost been homeless due to Owners not want to rent a house to so many.
Invasive rental applications that are 8 pages long. Listings with pictures that are clearly NOT THE PROPERTY ADVERTISED as it wastes everyones time.
Reduce rentals or increase rental rebates for pensioners.
Tenants who understand what signing a lease/contract really means.
To ensure that both renters and Real Estate are both aware of what is acceptable and what is not.
being able to transfer bonds from one place to the next only if you owe no monies and you will get your bond refunded in full.
"look at means of making rentals more longer term than what is currently offered, and look at way of making existing bond moneys transferable to new properties rather than refunding to renters."
More rules to benefit tenants.  Exit cleaning to be provided by rental agent as no matter which outside cleaner you use they find their cleaning is never good enough.
Being more empowered to respond to Real Estate agents unreasonable demands 
Static sting bulling from owners/landlords. 
Better Inspections prior to moving in.
"Currently depending on real-estate agents, there are a lot of hidden expenses which can catch out some people i.e... water charges the rent of a house should include all expenses so that bond can be returned in full when moving to a new residence - it can be financially hard when you expect to receive a sum of money and a real-estate finds an excuse to keep most of that money, also hand over inspections should be done by a 3rd party as there are some agents that make it difficult to use your choice of bond/carpet cleaners."
"Responsiveness to maintenance requests.
Clearer guidelines for breaching rental agents.
Ability to withhold rental payments when breaches are not resolved for urgent maintenance requests. "
"THE LANDLORD HAS TO GIVE THE TENANT 2 MONTHS NOTICE OF INTENTION TO NOT RE-NEW LEASE, BUT THE TENANT ONLY HAS TO GIVE 2 WEEKS NOTICE!
ALSO, WHEN A TENANT SIGNS A LEASE THEY HAVE TO PAY 2 WEEKS RENT UPFRONT, BUT RENT ARREARS ARE WHEN THEY ARE ALRAEDY 1 WEEK BEHIND, NOTICE TO LEAVE WHEN THEY ARE 2 WEEKS BEHIND, AND THEN BY THE TIME THEY VACATE THEY ARE 3 WEEKS BEHIND - LEAVING ONLY 1 WEEKS BOND LEFT FOR CLEANING/REPAIRS, AND LANDLORD IS THEREFORE HAVING TO CLAIM ON LANDLORDS INSURANCE.  ITS NOT FAIR!"
Tenants to be responsible for the damage they do to rental properties.
Dealing with rental agents.  Some are much better than others.
Notice of entry time frames - particularly regarding sale inspections & other sale related entry eg. valuations. More than 24hrs notice should be given if an owner expects the property to be looking its best
Limit the number of people that can be in one dwelling.
"Better cooperation of rental agencies with tenants, price guarantee long term "
Landlords have all the power in the relationship
Standardise rules across all states
To be able to have a dog in any rental property withou. Needing approval or permission.
Better communication with Real Estate
Real Estate agents general attitudes towards tenants. Always appear negative and not openminded.
Fairer laws to protect the rights and property of the landlord
"How tenants are treated by rental agency staff, the property owners, and how properties are hardly ever pet friendly."
The owner to do repairs without using it as an opportunity to increase the rent. I’m too scared to ask for repairs as every time the my have done anything the rent has increased over the next month. 
"1. Create a system where the renters can have an agent representing them, in addition to the agents representing the landlords.  
2. Require open homes to last more than 15 minutes
3. Allow for a longer lead time to rent a house or apartment.  It would benefit ALL parties if renters were able to plan a month or two ahead before I move instead of finding a place and having to organise a move in a week or two."
2 Routine inspections instead of 4 per year
"notification periods, they need to be the same for both parties. I have to give 60 days notice to tenants, they only have to give 2 weeks"
"Im sorry but I can't choose from 2! So first is not being so strict with pets. 
Second is the leaving property cleaning is stricter here! I've rented numerous properties in Vic and was able to clean the property myself to obtain bond back. My last rental here I had so much trouble with getting the cleaning done to their stabdard which was ridiculous. They weren't happy with our cleaner, so we went and tried to fix it up but still not happy! They insisted on then using their cleaner! "
RTA red tape
Less house inspections
As a owner of a rental property the law shouldn't be that we have to give two months notice to leave on a periodic agreement this give the tenant why to long to breach with rent
Better processes in inspections when searching for rentals
I would like to always have the option of an ongoing month to month lease after the initial lease period rather than being locked down to another long lease period and having to miss out on a more suitable property or break a lease to move for any number of reasons 
"BONDs..  Most renters have a problem raising a bond of 4 week rent as well as two weeks rent in advance. especially if they are relocating. 

My suggestion is to instigate a renters insurances policy. Where the tenant has the option to either pay the bond OR take out renters insurance to cover up to twice the normal bond. The renter would take the insurance for the period of the rental and keep it up to date. Renters with a good track record would get a lower premium and renters with a poor track record would either be denied insurance or have to pay a higher premium. "
"'- fairer conditions for renters
- capped rental prices
- easier to view new rentals when wanting to move"
Owners who realise it may be their house but it's our home and simple things like being able to put pictures on the wall make a huge difference. If I can make a house feel like my home I'm more likely to stay long term and put extra effort into caring for the property.
"I find the standards are well below those I have experienced in the ACT.
Safety and fit for use requirements of rental properties."
Giving renters more options and rights
"The realestate coming in every 3 months and taking photos of each room in the house.
personally its intimidating."
Stop the rents going up to ridiculous amounts. Makes it very tough for sole parents.
More affordable rent. Hard to save up for a house deposit.
Better communication as to guidelines for both landlord and tenant
Less paperwork involved
Maintenance requests completed as if it were my own home. Ie; things are left undone that I would want done if it were my home
There was no respect for our privacy with constant entry notices
Frequency of default home inspection from quarterly to yearly
Not have rented proppities up for viewing allowing people to get ther hopes up
More ability to personalise the property 
rental prices are way out of control and with having your rent increase every time you sign a new lease renewal. Also having high rent and nothing getting fixed in a timely matter as well as not doing any pest control.
"Aircon in the house for summer
Allow house trained pets
Allowed to put pictures on wall"
Less inspections and tradesmen coming through the rental property when it suits them and receiving letters stating when they are coming through during work hours. 
Online access for more parts of the process
Tighter regulation - landlords have more power than tenants. The places people live and make their homes should not be an instrument of someone else's profit
Allowing renter's to have small pets.
The unfair terms for a Landlord on time for notice to leave.  Tenant only has to give one month in most cases however Landlord has to give minimum of two months.  This is unfair especially when dealing with an unpaying or bad tenant who is treating your home badly.
Make it easier to get difficult or non-paying tenants out.
not force the tenants to have to be inspected as much as you  do
"When problems or repairs are identified, I feel as a tenant these requests for help are not always delivered or accepted in good spirit."
"Improved communication between the tenant and the owner via endorsed and mediated phone application or web based program.  All communications are then logged and can be used to settle disputes.

Certain attributes should then be rated (Eg. Response speed) so that tenants can view the property owners performance based on previous tenant experience and make an informed decisions before being locked into a 6-12 month contract.

Tenant's must provide references and checks prior to approval to rent but property owners simply let the agent ""sell"" the tenancy agreement on face value and/or promises of property improvements post rental agreement often which are then delayed or forgotten.  There is little a tenant can do to enforce improvement on the property short of breaking the lease due to a real estate repeatability breaching the agreement and then having to spend more money to find, rent and move to a new property. "
"More dog friendly rentals. Laws in place regarding rental properties that are prone to mould due to problems with the premises - particularly not proper ventilation due to no screens on property and therefore place is closed up a significant portion of the day. Tenants are suffering due to lack of laws demanding landlords to ensure place has adequate ventilation. Screening should be mandatory in my mind after I had mould cover most of my property throughout the whole brand new apartment due to no sunlight and no screens. Also, clothes lines or dryers should be standard and minimum. Also need stronger education or measures in place to ensure tenants know their rights and landlords follow through with this. I regularly had my landlord knock on my door and expect to come in and/or not give 24 hr notice and felt obliged to let him in. I had no privacy. I wanted to stay friendly as he lived next door and it was hard to uphold my rights whilst also doing this until things got nasty and he refused to take any responsibility for the mould despite a mould report saying otherwise. Laws needs to also be in place so that landlord cannot try to pass on 12 month water bill. Or if this is the only option they need to notify us that we will receive a 12 month water bill so that we can budget for this larger expense. "
"The cost and conditions.
Not being treted like a low class citizen from real estate agents."
Not having to prove your income if you have a proven rental ledger history of paying your that amount of rent for a very long time. 
More freedom for renters and rent to include water charges
"I'd like to see a more equitable approach to renters.  For instance, you get treated the same whether you're a bad tenant or a good tenant.  I treat my rented apartment like it's my own home, however the treatment to me by the real estate (managing the property) is no better than if I was a bad tenant."
How real estate agent behaviour
Not so many hurdles to jump when applying for rental property.
Allow for longer tenancy terms. 
Pricing of rentals in the Gokd Coast are to high 
Increase housing affordability so we didn't have to rent. It is not possible to simultaneously offer housing affordability while creating an investment market. Negative gearing needs to be abolished for future purchases and capital gains discount should also be changed.
Legislation in place should be strictly followed by real state agents or manager.
"Nothing I think it’s all fair.
"
"That the landlord would maintain the condition of the house as if they were living in it i.e. peeling wallpaper, falling down fences, paint peeling off the outside of the house. "
It would be great to be allowed to have a dog at our property. My kids can’t understand why we can’t have one. 
"I think the application process is stressful . At my previous place the exit inspection was extremely picky. For instance they wanted to take my whole bond because there were a few marks - not holes or gouges - from the car doors on the walls of the very narrow garage. Nowhere else. Just the garage. To me that’s just wear and tear. 
Also at that place there was an attitude of not caring when I complained about the noise of the dog, which I thought was not allowed. "
"Lease auto-renewal.
Rental agents/landlords are always in a position of power over housing as they can push the boundaries of the current legislature and RTA policy that renters feel obligated to accept as the threat of being forced to move at the end of sometimes 6 months leases is always there. Having leases auto-renew unless both parties agree or in the case of house sale and/or the landlord moving into the home would remove this power imbalance."
Modify the Brsibane City Plan 2014 to allow more than 6 students in one household in areas within 1km of Education Institutions
Owners and managers generally have the preference on disputes as tenants generally get disadvantaged when moving out of units and houses.
Have specific details on what internet is available at a residence (typical speeds/download limits). Possibly just services in general.
Ability to make sure changes to property
Have more power to remove tenants that are damaging the property
"Lower rental prices

that property owners do maintainence every year.
To be able to hang pictures on walls."
Level the rules/powers between owners and tenants - today it is more in favour of tenants
More leniency at the end of a lease to find another house as your lease date might not coincide with other propertys it makes it very hard to run smoothly. 
"Price of rentals 
Pet allowances
Real estate agent screening system "
Better quality staff in real estates!
"'-the rent for 2 bedroom properties are too expensive
-agent's inspection - every 3 months is too much
-more pet ok rentals will be nice
-breaking lease is too costy"
Better availability of pet friendly rentals
It doesn't seem to bad at present.
being able to make the house our home more . Hang pictures less inspections 6 months instead of 3 months inline with all other states 
More flexibility and case by case management
Timeframes for QCAT applications to be heard decreased - enforcement of QCAT orders to be carried out faster by the police. 
 Ring able to do more in the yard without permission. Little things obviously not major changes.
I would like the dealing with Property Managers/Real Estates to be more user friendly.
If I were allowed to own a pet in my residence . The landlord has given it the ok but the body Corp say no animals . 
Not feeling like you have to take photo evidence of everything before you move in. Not feeling like you have to deliver a brand new house upon vacating yet it's often not to that standard when you move in
Ability of property owner to raise rent every year when comparative costs in the area are not reflective of rent cost. 
Documented every communication b/w tenant & landlord to avoid miscommunication. 
More affordable rental prices and more secure long term leases
"Agents (such as Ray White) should not be allowed to charge tenants a fee to pay their rent!!
Should not need landlord approval to put hooks in wall or paint a wall!!"
"Clearly Defined Rights and Obligations, more security for the renter in knowing there position, I have been renting for 20 years, but I do not know at the end of each lease whether I will get another change or I will get kicked out, there is no Security for the renter and no Transparency."
"Talent need to take responsibility to do basic brilliantly. E. G, change light bulbs, clean reanghood regularly, and take care of rental equipment like their own"
Make it easier to release bonds
Cheaper rent in inner city suburbs
Property Managers need to be better trained
More support for renters when bond is withheld due to actions of previous tenants AND when you ask for maintenance to be performed not having to wait 10 days to get anything done.
"Being allowed to have pets in any house,  aloowed to make small modifications to make it feel like a home"
Never buy a rental house again
I can't think of anything right now.
Opportunity for a secure longer lease where the rent does not rise yearly
"Stop agents from abuse of power or improve the standards of agents, for example, my current agent LJ Hooker, FAILS to do thorough property inspections but when I give my notice to leave the agent WILL DO a thorough inspection and I am expected to fix issues that were there prior to me moving in. Also time given to remedy a bond clean is insufficient, I was given 6 hours notice to reclean a property."
"Making the time between peridioc inspections 6mths after the first 12 months of occupancy. Having property managers who realise that the house will now be brand new condition when leaving/after being occupied for a certain amount of time. Yearly pest control included. Longer leases like Europe have. Home ownership is no longer possible for many. The ability to change things, hang pictures and have pets or chickens without paying extra bond but with the provision that property returned to original state unless on agreement. "
listing of both private and managed properties available for rent
Inspections less often when it is evident that the tenants are looking after the property well. Easier to rent properties which are pet friendly
Having the availability to sign long term lease more than 1 yr. Also for long term tenants less inspections.
Allow tenants to have pets.
Improve quality of managers
"There is a feeling of distrust towards renters, in the sense that it is immediately assumed that problems in the house are due to tenants. Instead of being neutral, giving us assistance/getting the problem looked at first before passing judgement. "
"One thing?? More renters rights. 

Also: Control over break lease charges. Legal representation for abuse by realtors and landlords (RTA is toothless and unwilling to represent on most cases). Update and increase funding to RTA so they can do a better job. Discontinue quarterly inspections...intrusive and demeaning. Tighten restrictions on the use of eviction without cause (used to frequently, sometimes simply to increase rent)."
Dealing with real estate companies
Remove the power that agents seem to have on exit inspections - they are beyond ridiculous
"Specific clarification of the term ""general wear and tear"" in tenancy agreements."
"Pets being allowed by default, removing the feeling of “asking mum and dad” for permission to hang photos / mount tvs etc."
"I wish property managers (especially those hired by large real estate companies) put more effort into the day to day maintenance of properties and lives of tenants. They seem to only care about the condition of the property when it is time to vacate and they withhold bond as much as possible. Also, bond cleaning is a clear way for renters to get ripped off. At my last property, the bond cleaners quoted us over the phone for $600, when they arrived at the property they said it would cost $1300. They said our only two choices were to pay or leave it. We needed to have a bond clean so I felt like we were being held ransom. At my current rental property, I asked to have my partner added to the leave and they charge me $225 dollars to process this. This was in July and my partner has still not been added and am still waiting on an additional set of keys. "
More freedom to do things to make house more homely
" Some form of Government control over the outrageous cost of rental property in the private sector? ( Hard one i know?)  At the very least, immediate controls by the Queensland Government over the increases to rents, in % terms at the renewal of an existing lease! Most importantly! Longer tenant leases as it stands right now, you can only get a six month lease for a property, going through a Real Estate Agent. ( Despite what the Real Estate Agents say?)  This way they can increase the rent twice a year or evict you and increase the rent even more! ( Even if you are a great tenant?) You have no say, no security, no stable home life in this rental market! Please Help Renters? "
"I'd like more power when dealing with demanding or unreasonable landlords. When seeking a rental property, It's difficult to obtain a property as I have two dogs, Id' like to see this change."
More pet friendly properties and complexes
Agents hold too much power.  There should be someone representing the landlord and someone representing the tenant in all transactions.
Less inspections. Be allowed to bring your pet. Be allowed to hang pictures on the walls
quarterly inspections for good tenants with a proven record
"Flexibility on allowal of pets, alterations to property such as hanging decorations as long as the property is left as it was found."
As a landlord - the current rules & regulations are not endorsed - this is a long term investment in my future & tenants have limited respect for property that is not theirs & ignore requirements already in place!
Cost and more transparency of property management.  
Have greater security in terms of long term renters rights.
I am discriminated against because I'm on an Aged Pension which is ridiculous when you think about it because I know what income I will have every week. 
The rules about letting pets be accommodated in spite of Body's Corporate forbidding them. The Body Corp should be able to make the determination. People with pets should rent a property that accepts pets and not one that doesn't and then take the land lord to the commission.
"Being good tenants, having a 3 monthly inspection is ttiresome. Also multiple entries per year to test smoke alarms seems excessive "
Cooperative real estate agents
I would give Tenants rights to have a pet in their rental property. It has been the cause of much hardship when pets make little difference to the condition of the rental property. I think it is unfair that tenants have the power to disqualify a tenant simply because they own a pet. 
"Allow pets, even just one"
Greater power to manage disruptive and unacceptable tenants
Increase modifications tenants can make internally to make home feel lived in.
Communication between renter and renting agency. Its absolutely appalling. And getting blamed for things you didn't cause (proof of not causing damage) the damage but trying to be tricked to pay for it anyways. 
Not requiring 4 weeks bond - 2 should be sufficient. It’s too much money to tie up.
"Real estates are too extreme when tenants exit a property with condition report, claiming items and expenses that are not required or warranted. "
Properties that are for sale should be tennant's free.
I would like long-term leases to be available so accommodation is guaranteed for a given period.
"As a landlord, ensuring the tennant has an obligation to treat the property in a manner that the landlord would want."
Properties that are for sale should be tenant free
"We were in a townhouse development, where the manager inspected our place every three months. I think this was fine; however, it would be nice (and seems fair) to make it every 6 months if you pass a certain number of inspections, say four or five."
Private rentals - never ending invasion of privacy and rental increases
Things to be fixed quicker a time frame
I feel landlords should be alot more leniant if you are wanting a periotic lease rather than being greedy and thinking of themselves as they are like that far to often. People maybe wanting to move for financial reasons etc so they should be abit more understanding of the tenant rather than themselves.
"Give more power to the renter and owner, not so much the agency"
More rights as a renter to combat against unreasonable owners and property managers on power trips
"Security, long term ability to stay in the same premises 
Able to make it feel like your home"
To have better rights in ending a tenants lease if they do the wrong thing
I believe that it is unfair that our personal possessions can be photographed during inspections.
Allowing renters to have pets
Real Estate Agents and some owners
"I am a landlord and have 2 properties. Again the situation depends entirely upon the relationship and communication between landlord and tenant. The tenant SHOULD remember they do not OWN the property and therefore should respect it, but equally as a LANDLORD it is the tenants 'home' to a degree. Give and take is required. I have had good and bad tenants. I do feel the law is more on their side and as a landlord we have all the risk. Giving more leeway to tenants is NOT what I am after. But I am reasonable and will try to give a good living experience to my tenants.  PS the questions below are too restrictive....the answers are not always as direct."
More properties that will accept pets.
More rights to the renter. For example in many parts of Europe. I've found that nobody takes any pride or responsibility for the houses they rent in QLD because they have no stability or guarantee they will be able to stay there. I've found that most people don't feel 'at home' in their rental.
Nothing as rented privately
It is unbelievable that in a property that I am treating as home that I am subject to approval to hang a photo on the wall. 
Owners have more rights when the tenants default on their agreement
"Landlords/managing agents have too much power.
I was taken advantage of when renting an apartment in the McWhirters building in Fortitude valley.
I was a good Tennant for 9 years
During that time 3 onsite managers who did not pass information on.
I lost all of my bond for what is general wear and tear after 9 years
I was left in a very vulnerable position.
Very, very angry and dissapointed that a bond is considered the landlords no matter what. Not enough time given to dispute the landlords claims as people are trying to find somewhere else to live at the same time.
"
"More rights for renters 
Landlord obligation to repairs"
extend the lease term and allow for 5 or 10 year terms
The rules favour to the owners rather then the renters who are paying the fees for the property to stay float and any profits made.
Having animals freely without consulting the real estate for approval.
More places to allow dogs
cut back on the 3 monthly inspections
"There's little to no enforcement against landlords or property managers who are non responsive or non compliant regarding their obligations, there needs to be more support from the govt and/or greater deterrents by way of punishments for landlords and property managers. A way of achieving this could be through a licencing program enforced by law (not industry bodies)"
"Allowing pets, unless there is a history of issues with that tenant. 
No matter the property size, if the house is tired and old, rent shouldnt be over $500. We should be getting our moneys worth for that high of price, a quallity house. Match rent to condition of house. 
It would be nice to hang curtain or pictures as desired."
Private landlord obligations 
Better property management from the property manager and better property maintenance
chasing up tenants who leave property in bad state and owe rent
"We rented for a short period only and found the experience to be fine.
As a landlord it would be preferable if it wasn't so difficult to get reports on previous tenant behaviour without having to engage an agency."
"'-lower renting prices and laws that protect the tenant
"
"Greater accountability, honesty, transparency, consultation from landlord"
"Better rental security, having certainty of a long lease and less fluctuation in the rent each time a lease is renewed"
"Home repairs. I can’t even bolt a shelf or cabinet to a wall and I have young children. The government recommends to secure them to a wall to keep the children safe, yet The government also doesen’t allow me to do that if I am renting?!?! Yes it leaves holes, but it’s tenants responsibility to fix them! What’s so hard. Europe can do it, we can’t? "
I think landlords need the ability to recope the full amount of damages created by tenants and the ablity to remove trouble tenants asap.  
"the ability to have a cat, without fear of not being successful in a rental application"
"Property managers and owners should not have the power to alter peoples lives so easily. For example, a lot of properties have a no pets rule for no good reason other than it is a bother. Having pets is proven to lift the mental health of people, which all of society benefits from."
"I have a full time job, but spend nearly half of my pay on rent. Although i owned a house and paid a mortgage before my divorce i'm finding it extremely hard at 43 and single to gather the funds to be able to save for a mortgage. I have nearly $250,000 in super due to nearly 20 years worth of full-time and contracting jobs. I would love to be able to tap into some of my super  to get a deposit. As i'm working full time in a secure job, i could re-pay that money back as a part of additional super contributions, and then spend my money on my loan instead on someone else's rental portfolio. 
The world seems to be designed for married or people in relationships, or young people trying to get a head start. There seems to be no contingency or consideration for people who have to re-start mid-life.  "
There needs to be an onus on renters to report maintenance items immediately.
"Owners willing to do more, when things need to do be. EG. Broken dishwasher ""oh it's the old tenants, not my responsibility! We asked for it to be removed it so we can put one in? Answer- NO! Also asked for green garden waste bin we were refused one! But we were expected to trim the bushes, mow the gardens and get rid of the endless palm fronds. Their answer - one skip voucher! On lease renewal guess what wanting more money so no choice but to move :( 

Also being able to have a pet dog, my daughter drives me crazy. owners next door have one, renters to the left side and all across the rear homes all have dogs we can't! yet all our inspections are excellent!"
"Hooks in the walls 
Not have to renew for a whole year after initial period
bond laws changed- had to pay ridiculous amount just for a small compost heap "
longer lease periods
"As a landlord, I would like the law changed so that body corps can't refuse pets.  Within reason of course, and such that the amenity of neighbours is not affected by noisy or other problem animals."
"Having a clearer understanding of my rights. 
Better communication from agents"
more rights for owners with bad tenants - less waiting times to evict a tenant who is non compliant and not paying rent
Having Real Estates cooperate more with the tenant
Prospective tenants need to have a rating as to how they look after some one elses house
Have owners fix things quicker than they do 
Better property managers
Accounting by property managers for landlords rental payments
I would not purchase the investment property.  I would have invested the money in shares or have just kept it in the bank.
"Not be punished for making minor modifications to the premises, ie. Hooks in walls for paintings. "
Rules about pets either relaxed or dispensed with
Having to give two months notice if we dont sign a new lease. 
"Not having to pay for water charges on top of exhorbadent rent.
This has only come in during recent times and needs to be made illegal.
"
Owner and realestate responsibility 
The real estate and how ththeththey deal with the clients.
Renters rights when it comes to useless real estate manager. RTA process is useless.
"Easier application forms relevant to the person wishing to rent, not the general forms and all the questions/references and paper work that they require."
more animal friendly properties
Allowing pets.  Saying on the advertising of houses that places are pet friendly then once you fill out application and hand it in you get told it’s up to owners to approve pets. And need to be under a certain weight or a particular breed
Clarification around wear and tear and having the tenant have to fix things in the house that don’t work. 
Give Landlords more rights to protect property from damage & misuse.
Would like a pet and to be able to hang photos on walls
Tenants being able to make improvements in old and falling apart rentals. Pets.
Frequency of inspections after a set period of time/performance
Giving better rights to landlords.
More leniency for long term renters
"Reverse the onus of proof from Tenant to Landlord.  Tenants must understand that the Landlord owns the property and that has with it historic rights inscribed in law, "
"Less frequent inspections! I can understand inspecting every 3 months with a new tenant, but after a while when they have established that they are good tenants, I think inspecting the property every 6 months or even anually would be adequate. "
QCAT understanding the importance of investors in providing housing in Queensland
Conditions of having pets to be easier 
Get rid of greedy managers
"the need for inspections, for renters that are doing the right thing"
have more control in which utility companies i have to use
"I was kicked out illegally from a retirement village. I took them to QCAT and won, but I got no money. I should have been paid for what they cost me."
Cheaper rent prices 
The rudest of the staff at real estates
"LJ Hooker makes you use proprietary software (DEFT) to pay your rent. If may make their life easier, but it costs me an extra $3.75 a week. Plain wrong."
More rentals that allow pets. 
Banned owners from selling during a lease
Drug testing as a standard condition of tenancy
More feedback and to be praised for looking after properties 
Rights for tenants when owners choose to sell their property whilst it's being tenanted.
There must be reasonable conditions for tenants to break a lease without penalty given change of circumstances causing financial hardship including sickness job opportunity and when family reduces in size unexpectedly. 
The ability to know pets are allowed 
Houses have full checks and all exit condition repairs compulsory before new tenants allowed in unit
Make it compulsory for rental agencies to have a fee free option for rent payments 
Let me put some hooks in the walls so that I can put up pictures without having to repaint the entire unit when I leave (because I'll never be able to match the paint)
Bond given tenancy board instead of cash to agents/landlords to avoid ripoffs
"Real Estate Agents, they think we as tenants own them. "
Allow tenants to make changes to the property with the consent of the landlord.
"Improved options for security of tenure for renters, particularly over longer periods (several years)."
"To be allowed to use standard picture hooks to display works of art. (To explain, we can hang pictures with stick-on hooks, but these are only suitable for light items, and they recommend not using for glazed frames.) "
as a landloard  I would have the 2 weeks notice to tenants instead of the 2 months.
There should be more rights for landlords in regards to damage from tenants and tenants just leaving properties with no real repercussions
"I am an excellent tenant and always try very hard to improve my rental.  I have painted the accommodations, made and upkept gardens etc but I have always felt the power is always with the landlord.  However I do understand there are ghastly tenants also.  I think there should be more security of tenure. Rental costs in nicer areas of Brisbane are exhorbitant and need to come down for lower paid workers and retirees. Where I am living at the moment in a retirement village the rent is extremely reasonable for the are but everyone of us is under threat to move ""if the units become financially unviable"" and this would you believe is a Baptist organisation which is supposed to care. We are all 70 - over 90.  Unfortunately money is the motivation now as with 95% of aged care/seniors accomodation developments.  So to answer the question - long term tenure for good tenants.  More affordable rent for singles, lower paid workers and retirees.  Government or social rentals that will always be rentals for life as in Europe without the threat of non renewal of lease through sale, or giving to family member or some such thing!
"
No pets as I am highly elergic to dogs and cats and always have piece of mind that there wasn’t one prior to my tenancy. The residue of one even after a bond clean still causes poor quality environment for my health. 
Increased responsibility on property owners to undertake routine repairs in a reasonable timeframe without the tenant having to take action.
"When it comes to leaving a rental property, I would like to see the real estate laws change and be a little more lenient and relaxed. "
"My owners refuse to install a front door security door, this should be mandatory "
"We have rented for 15 years in QLD.  We have always got our bond back, always paid our rent on time and maintained each property like it was our own.  We are treated with contempt by most agents we have dealt with despite our immaculate record.  We have had repairs outstanding, entry without the proper notice and have constantly had to ring the RTA to get advice when we have been hounded by agents and we have always been in the right!  We do the right thing but because we rent we are tarnished.  It would be great to see this attitude change for those of us who do the right thing."
Communication with landlord directly and not through agent
Longer rental leases. Better responses to repair property.
"Make it compulsory for all dwellings that require yard maintenance to include a garden shed for storage of equipment and mower fuel.
To provide a certain amount of water usage paid for by the landlord to enable lawns to be kept greener without costing too much. 
"
"Lease,to put mind at ease could be 3 years instead of every 12 months"
The frequency of inspections and random entry notices when you've clearly been a good tenant for over 18 months! Can be very frustrating and inconvenient.
Landlords/real estates compensating you for extra usage fees from faults of equipment e.g. hot water system which spike your power and/or water bills
Force the Real Estate agents and tenants to do both Entry and Exit reports together! As the Agents rarely have any faults marked on their records and the what the tenants find is always questioned. 
"Fair price that is transparent.

Property Manager that use the same standard of cleanliness going into a property and is fair on exit."
Not having to pay water rates
"Allowed to hang pictures,  clear water bill laws and longer leases! "
A strengthening of tenant’s rights. Less intrusion by real estate agents/ landlords
"The renter has no rights, we pay good money yet we are treated poorly. Landlord/property management seem to think they can enter when suits them and not consider the renter."
"Longer lease options for greater housing stability/ certainty
Quicker response times on maintenance
Ability to put up pictures on walls
Allow pets as default
Limit rental increases"
Flexibility on inspections to work around people who work full time 
Being able to speak directly to owners if necessary
"Property not up to standard, agent should do more to have repairs done and issue correct entry notices. "
More flexible terms after initial.6 or 12 month term eg. Be able to go to month by month after
Dogs being allowed in rentals
Banks acknowledge rent payments as a form of deposit to help enter the buyers market. 
Rental agencies or property manager treating use the renter with more respect. I have only experience them as dictators where they only dictate what we should and how we should live in homes where we as the renter pay the owners mortgage and the property manger fees. 
"More knowledge on the neighbours as in if the Real Estate have a history with problems between the neighbour and the tenants in the past then it should be disclosed. We had the neighbours from hell to the point of taking them to court and only after we moved, were we told that this had happened to 2 lots of tenants in the same house with the same neighbours. Because we took them to court we are still having trouble with them even after we moved."
More transparency in bond returns.
have landlords actually have to make repairs in a timely manner so tennent's do not fear repercussions for needing the repairs eg notice to vacate or rental increases. Also allowance of pets (inside or out) but if any damage has been done to the premises it is the tennent's responsibility. Rental applications should not be denied because of pets. Rental prices are also to high for low income earner's.
That tenants paint not just clean after a long term rental experience and that they manage their own internal pest control.
Cost of private renting.  Not enough Government Renting for pensioners or people on low incomes.
"That legislation be enacted in Queensland to clearly proscribe the conditions wherein the registered pets of tenants, which might also reasonably inhabit a residential tenancy of the type being hired out through a residential tenancy agreement, may be allowed to do so, free from any unwarranted discriminatory, or prejudicial control of the Lessee, or the Lessee's agent, under a tenancy agreement.  "
One thing? Inspections by the RE every 4 months are pretty intrusive in my opinion. It's too often.
Power tripping property managers
"some agents ridiculous expectations of renters departing a property to have the property at the same state as when they moved in, especially if it's 3-5 years later."
"Don't favour tenants. This discourages owners purchasing properties for rent. If holding the property is not owner friendly people will not not purchase in the first place. This will result in decline of properties available and force prices up, if not lack of available properties. It is a borderline punt in the first place to buy a property hoping  value will go up. I can tell you from experience my property is worth less than it was 10 years ago and after considerable renovation. I am in outer Brisbane suburbs, not a country town. It has not been worth my hassle and in hindsite regret buying."
Recovery of unpaid rent and compensation for property damage must be guaranteed without lengthy legal battles and delays.
"I am 74 years. I pay $520.00 per Fortnight which is 1/2 my Pension,even with Rent Assistance.
With the higher costs of Power and Phone Food etc. a Reduction in Rent would help the situation.

More updated rules required in the Tenants favour.
"
To have more freedoms while renting. It’s hard to feel like it’s your home when you have to ask permission to hang a picture 
More streamlined rules e.g. the smoke alarm rules are excessive and expensive to property owners.
Make it easier for people with pets to find a rental. Especially small pets like indoor cats or small dogs.
Real Estate must take pictures of the property as part of the entry report.
"Real estate agents having short opening viewing times for renters, long convenient times for buyers.
"
Being able to lay official complaints against useless agents
Travel allowances via tax system to inspect property reinstated
"Removal of $150 changed of bond fee by Metro, Ray White, and other agencies. They do not get involved and charge simply for the incredibly limited paperwork. Such a waste and many people are tricked into accepting such terms. "
"I am currently both, both landlord and renter, soon to be home owner again.  There needs to be stricter vetting of tenants! Should be asking their current employer for a reference."
Rents need to be more affordable
"The communication and support for renters' rights. I have found myself in disputes with real estate without knowledge of my rights as a tenant, or knowing my rights but being unable to enforce them without fear of unjust retaliation."
"Having a consistent property manager, and being able to have extra animals during tenancy"
"Even with various subsidies, basic utility costs, especially electricity, are still far too high."
"Allow pets. Most people in my generation will rent their entire lives, never owning their own home. It is unrealistic to expect an entire generation to not own pets. "
Landlords who are respectful and abide by the rules
Rent price and regular maintenance security lights doors screens
Not being over charged on rent when property is worth less
Having to move regularly because the owner is selling.
honestly or real estate agents
"Longer contracts, 2 or 3 yrs
When in a house block the water to be paid by owner to look after gardens and grass."
That property management/ Real Estates don’t have the say about the renters getting their Bind back and independ company should have the day.
Easy access to opens and more notice of leases becoming available in the future
as an ex landlord - i'd like to maintain control over pets in a house and lease ends
"To be more in tune with the needs of seniors, especially with the allocation of a second bedroom. Aging changes our requirements! Especially when husband or wife suffer from an undiagnosed condition,which compromises the wellbeing of the other. (Our personal experience had us moving 3 times in one year in order to have the required second bedroom.)"
To be able to get landlords to do essential repairs and to adhere to their legal requirements without fear of not having my lease renewed 
"Recognise that I am a good responsible tenant with many years of excellent reports, and understand o will be responsible if I hang something on the walls or have a pet. Allow me to do so
"
"More options, less discrimination against pet owners."
"Being able to choose who tenants my property within my criteria, is non smoker and no pets"
Transfer of bond to new property rather than having to have funds tied up in 2 rentals for a period. ACT has done this successfully.
Being able to have a pet. Also not having inspections so often
"We have both owned and rented.  Currently renting, pets are a part of a family and should be included.  Putting a hook for a family picture in a suitable place, should be easy.  We actually do both, and have no problem, because we always look after it like our our home. Because it is! That's what you pay for!  However, we always fix problems such as dishwashers etc.. ""to not be a hassle"".  "
"More availability for 6 month leases, as getting tied into a 12 month contract restricts freedom of choice and the desire to change out of the rental habit. All renters dream of owning their own home one day and getting comfortable in this system is a trap for personal desire to change."
Allowing pets in all properties. 
"As a renter, there is more than one thing I would like to change:

1.  Agencies/owners should not have the option of walking through a rental property (even if they give the required 24 hours' notice) if the tenants are not at home. This includes inspections held in the middle of the day when tenants are often at work and cannot get home to be there when agents walk through the house. Agents/owners should not be able to give one set time as to when they will be undertaking an inspection (maybe this is another separate point), they should instead firstly check for a day and time with tenants so that it is an appointment that is mutually acceptable. At the moment, tenants tend to be treated as second-class citizens and 'jump' when agents/owners say they have to. It is not an equal partnership.
2.  Have longer notice periods - 24 hours is not enough time to advise of a walkthrough (again, see note above - a mutually agreed time would be much better).
3.  Reduce inspection times the longer that tenants are in a dwelling. If tenants are going to wreck a place, they are likely to do it within the first year and if they are considerate (as most tenants are), then agents/owners ought to treat them with some respect and trust that they will continue to look after the dwelling. 
4.  This would be a huge ask but it would be great if there were impartial RTA employees to witness the walk through at the beginning and end of tenancies and to witness entry and exit condition reports.
5.  Pass on Council rubbish tip vouchers for a property that tenants are renting, to the tenants.
6.  Have annual health inspections done on all properties that are being rented, in between tenancies. Check for things like tap water quality, loose asbestos, electrical safety, hazards within the property boundary, proximity to possible carcinogenic equipment (electrical transformers, etc.).
7.  Have some rules around timelines with breaking a lease. At the moment, if tenants break a lease, the agents/owners have carte blanche as to when to choose new tenants to take over a lease. In some cases, it appears that they make no effort to do so as they know they are assured of receiving rent until the lease runs out. I know of two cases where this has happened, one quite recently."
The cost of rent has gotten too high it’s hard for a person to live alone 
Rent can only be increased every 24 months and the increase must be controlled by a neutral entity. 
Have landlords attend to problems with in a timely manner. it seems as long as real estate agent sends them a request for repairs the real estate is covered. the owner does not have any obllgation to do the work.
Itemised expenses taken from bond
Limiting rental prices. Giving families a better chance with multi-room rentals.
More streamlined dispute resolution process such as an independent umpire to rule quickly on small bond disputes.
"Less personal information 
More protection around breaking lease"
More communication between tenants and the owner
When a place is damaged before you move into it. An then you try your best to fix it. I now have been apparently blacklisted. Because of the real manager who had never been to the house before 
Cost. Rental agent rules need to be same across the board. 
Remove landlords ability to evict tenants without cause.
Ensure that homes are correctly maintained
Rental Properties with in a Body Corporate that do not have individual water meters (because of their age and laws change) owners should be able to charge tenants  water usage.
Make it easier to find an appropriate place and be approved for it. 
Decrease in rental costs
"Owners who have ""changed circumstances"" and terminate the lease
for example, if an owner fails to manage their mortgage repayments then there is NO protection for the tenant for being evicted by the bank, before the end of the lease term..... regardless of the tenants fulfilment of all lease conditions"
Make sure multiple payment options remain available and do not change to one payment option that benefits the real estate business in terms of limiting their costs in the middle of a lease.
"A bit more freedom with feeling like its home, maybe be able to hang some pictures, instead of inspections every 3 months maybe make it 6 months. "
Access to tenants & landlords/agents data base and history/rating
"Make more property managers aware that not all leases have to be 12 month only they can be longer if both parties approve. 
An across the board charge on fees charged by real estates "
Access to pet-friendly properties in good repair/with modern amenities. 
Better help for tenants with real estate agents for communication and rights
"noise and temperature insulation
Windows are very bad quality"
More affordable rents and more places that will accept pets
"Pets allowed in properties with grassed yards, more responsibility and reliability on ignorant and careless property managers "
"more emphasis on getting issues sorted out in the house we are renting. We feel we are at the ""mercy"" of the Landlord when it comes to getting work done when it is needed."
The ability of estate agents to easily over state their claims to rental bonds at exit time.
Standards of health around rental properties and being able to have them actually enforced before loosing all of your belongings / health in the process.
"Leases with a term longer than 12 months, e.g. 2-3 years"
Increase the level of accountability required from landlords when renting their property i.e when a promise is made verbally and in writing by the agent on behalf of the landlord they should see it through
The existing system is very tilted towards tenants rights and ignores the fact that the owner has a large investment in providing the tenant a facility to rent.   In particular I refer to the process the toothless process in trying to remove a tenant which is useless and even if followed to the letter still has to go to arbitration.   So what is thwe point of thw process???
"have a Queensland Government that doesn't discriminate- to those who can't afford a brand new home $400,ooo+ with a first home buyers grant and give all the lower waged people a fare go to have the same home buyers grant  to purchase a Used home$250,000+ so we don't have to pay rent. It Has Been So Unfair we Queenslanders should All be entitled to our Queensland taxes"
"The attitude of real estate agents.   They treat you like second class citizens, they’re rude a lot of the time & dismissive."
Reduce the weekly rent amount.
More freedom for tenants and less bullying by real estate agencies 
"Payment method. Currently, Real Estate Agents have come up with ways of using a third party for a tenant to use to pay rent. The third party then add an additional charges and fees to the advertised price. Currently, paying rent should be very easy without incurring these additional burdens. Make it rental payments easy and affordable without adding extra cost. "
Pets allowed in all premises. Also repairs made in a timely manner. 
Where Tennent has improved property some form of discount/ retribution given. 
"Make bad tenants more accountable for the damage they cause and force them to repay debts that they have incurred, especially when a QCAT judgement has been made about these issues. For a tenant to be able to simply walk away and never repay any money and move straight into another property is unacceptable."
"Once you have been renting for 12 months, not having to lock into another contract.  Less inspections after you have been a good tenant."
Organisational oversight of Property Managers
Homes more pet friendly
have clear rules for both owner and tenants
I think once you’ve proved you’re a trustworthy tennant inspections should be changed to bi annually. 
"Better security in a home, length of lease / ability to renew."
Quicker responses from rental agency and owner
"Have more freedom, we aren't allowed to improve anything, and owners don't want to"
Managers understanding the rules. More respect for tenants and their right to privacy.
Requiring landlords to make repairs in a very short timeframe after being notified
"The agents have too much power. More rights for renters would be a good start, after all it is their home for the period they are renting."
"Being allowed to hang things on the wall and make it feel more like a home. We've been living here for over 4 years.
If you are a good tenant, proven after several inspections and based on your interactions, reduce the frequency of regular inspections, to avoid the intrusion so often. 
Give definition for what is fair tear and wear relative to the length of time you spend in a rental property"
"If rental agencies did not treat their tenants like disposable idiots to use at their convenience. Rented at several agencies and this factor is consistent. Never failed a house inspection/ didn't get full bond back/ never got a noise complaint, etc and in return you are just income. "
A real estate who had contact with tenants and returns phone calls 
More flexible inspection times. They want people with incomes to rent the houses but most agencies aren't flexible with house inspections to view the property to rent. 
Easier access to energy saving & green living solutions.
"I rented for 35 years. Circumstances were such that I couldn’t buy. I was fortunate to rent directly from owners for over half that time. But there was still the threat each year (lucky enough to get 12 mths leases rather than the more common 6 months) of having to find another place. The last place my partner and I were in for 9 years and every year for the last 5 the owner was uncertain about whether they would sell. The whole time we had to live with their horrible decor, but it was a spectacular property. So I’d say, longer European style leases with options to change/refurb interior. More like commercial leases. Given that so many properties are owned by investors who’ve bid lower income earners out of the housing market, and we now have an huge numbers of people who will rent for the rest of their lives, the regulators should give renters more rights, and stop treating them like they are naughty children who’ve failed to buy and therefore have to live in some crappy investment property that needs renovation. Renters would be more invested in maintaining the property if they had lower rent and longer leases and the ability to negotiate on refurbishment and control their environment a little more."
Make it more affordable and fair for people to rent 
More leniency towards having pets.
If i recieve interest on my bond held with the Government.
"Renting through an agency i was subjected to frequent inspections. As a previous property owner who was devistated by the disaster left by a tenant, a dreadful property manager, then suffering sunsequent losses we now find we have the polar opposite issue where we want to feel at home but don't because of frequent intrusion by agents (even though we received great feedback on the inspections). We now do private rental, no agent and have been in the same place 12 years. I would alter the frequency of inspections to be reasonable."
Increase the bond to a level that will cover damage and loss of rent. Also change the legislation so that tenants can be liable for damage and loss of rent so that owners can more easily recover costs from bad tenants
Property Management experience has been poor. Difficult to get bond back/breached over petty things.
Overhead expenses are high for managing the property as the insurance and body coperate fees are much higher tha in other states. 
"Inexperienced landlords
Bond cleaning is a rort 
Landlords rights when a property is for sale
High rents
Attitude towards tenants ( as if they are scum )"
Less inspection...every 3 months is not necessary 
more rental options on the affordable end of the spectrum
Allow pets in all properties
Rents need to be cheaper
I would like to see the tenanant be able to do more things to the unit/house within reason to make the place feel more like a home instead of making the tenant feel their living quarters are just temporary.
When things break or dont work the real estate gets to it right away instead of waiting on owners approval as that can take days and we should be allowed to put our child safety things up without having to ask as it's for the safety of our children
"Either the frequency or the invasive nature of inspections from our current agent, and lack of information made available to us about our rights - our experience has been to receive forms telling us about the agents (or their suppliers) rights to invade our privacy"
making sure the ones who destroy houses are totally blacklisted so that the ones who do right aren't compared against them ever
Fewer home inspections for long term tenants (living in the home for over one year without any issues). 
More pet friendly properties for tenants
More fairer notice periods for tenants vacating a property. 30 days notice would be more fair for owners rather than 2 weeks
More regulation for the real estate agents to comply with. 
"Landlord arrives without following RTA protocol Two rooms left with floors not yet tiled for 1yr. Interior walls unpainted in one room, not painted  for six years in remainder of duplex. Insect screens need to be replaced. Cupboard door broken for over 6wks. No key to security door. Bedroom window has large cracks,occurred during cylone Debbie No key to back door"
To be able to go on a month by month lease if needed.
Better renting management. Previous manager was very slack
Too many and too complex rules and regulations
More accurate tenant database.
Affordable & stable rent prices without $60 jumps per week with no improvement to the property & property managers who actually do their job in a timely manner.
Being able to make it more your own home not space you rent.
No for it to be so on the renter to photo graph everything and still have to fight against there real estate claiming pre existing damages that were on the entry report as your problem and start the process of a claim on your mind before you even go bsck to verify. 
"Stop renting. Current Landlord is trying to force us into a new long fixed term contract after we advised at the outset of our situation where we only require an additional 2-3 months periodic lease at the end of current agreement in January 2019. We are building a house, and they are forcing  us to pay for an additional 6 months minimum rental contract - or they will evict us before our new House is ready."
being able to put pictures up on the walls and making the house more homey
Change the law to allow pets in every rental. Stop the current discrimination against our loved members of our family.
"Communication, ease of access to suitable properties, safety regulations on owners, rent prices need to go down!"
"RTA need to have the right to force an injunction on owners breaking the law and disposing of 
or taking for their own use tenants belongings when they haven't held them for 28 days as per the tenants rights. Only being able to lodge an urgent dispute does nothing to keep irreplaceable memories from getting literally trampled on in a skip bin while police stand guard and keep you held at bay while an owner commits this offence. "
"I think break lease fees are ridiculously high. There should be a capped price that they can not go over. 

I also don’t feel as if making minor improvements to the home such as hanging art, repainting walls to freshen them up etc, should be grounds for a breach. You can’t treat a rental like your home. "
"The real estate agent tried to bully me into making improvements to the apartment and threatened to give a negative review to future landlords if I wouldn't comply. I was living on my own at the time (I am female) and being verbally threatened by a physically strong man in my apartment was an extremely intimidating experience. I tried calling the RTA but the agent faced absolutely no consequences whatsoever. There needs to be a proper review process to deal with such cases, especially if there are repeated complaints. "
Rent through a decent agent
Can frustrating when your renting a property over a considerable period and rent goes up but the property isn’t improved or updated with the rises
Someone to be on the renters side without biased views
Have contractors turn up when they say they are going to be there.
For realestate agents in Qld to be transparent and operate with honestly and integrity. 
Drop the whole RTA rental bond system.
A garage door that doesn’t “wake the dead” every time it’s opened. 
Able to hang pictures
Better communication over repairs that need doing. Owners to slow to respond.  If it was damage caused by the tenant they would be jumping up and down for it to be fixed but tenants have to continually wait or it doesnt get fixed at all.
better communication between landlords and tennants
The ability to do what I want without asking like I'm a child!
"Agents treat you like a second class citizen. Most renters never get there bond back.
Allow pictures etc to be hung. 
Renters are not allowed to make a home."
"All rental properties should be fit with security screens, garden sheds and water tanks."
"Only one? It's fixed, corrupting and stupid to limit such a question and demonstrates profound government incompetency to severely restrict such information coming your way so that you might actually do something constructive to improve these outcomes. 1. Greatly restrict the powers of agents and owners when it comes to them controlling a renter's lifestyle and all the permissions renters must ask to live 'normally' to keep their family safe and content. Frequent inspections are intrusive and  persist long after renters have proven their worth as tenants so it shouldn't be an ongoing trauma. Pets are healthy to have for tenants and their children and are a normal part of Australian life. Making alterations that simply involve a screw in the wall to hang a picture or painting a wall isn't damaging the structure of any property so they shouldn't have a say about it. Children have died from falling draws because the balance of power has been so fucked up and tenants are treated as second or third class citizens because they've been disempowered by feudal economic forces."
Being allowed to have animals more easily. 
"Some properties are very old and in bad condition, and I don’t feel like enough responsibility is given to the landlord to ensure renovations/mound removal/upkeep is completed. "
we are at the mercy of owners when it comes to rent increases - there needs to be more control over when and how they can increase rent
"That the owner should have to make the house as liveable and comfortable for the people renting the property. Simple things like a new paint job, installation of ceiling fans or new carpet should be a must. "
"I’d like to see the arrears and damages from tenants , process shorter. Arrears and damages  can end up way past the bond use before it gets to the courts. "
I changed from incompetent real estate agents managing our properties to self manage
"I feel like I have needed to make a lease renewal decision heaps in advance, I could be wrong but every year I find it hard to renew my lease that much in advance."
Make tenants more accountable for looking after rental property.
Rules for a property applying for all tenants (eg pets and smoking)
Communication between the owners of the rental property and the people who are renting. 
More acceptance of pets indoors. 
Lower the rent prices.
Require all rental properties to undergo a registration inspection to ensure basic health and safety standards are met and that all residential properties offered for rent are meet basic legal requirements for residential dwellings.
To be able to hang pictures & have a dog as a standard part of renting.
More agency experience by individual agents
Landlords have a set timeframe to fix any issues with the property. Especially ones that affect safety.
The extremely high rent for such a small apartment with very aged carpet and fittings
Accountability of Property Managers and its company
Improve the maintenance process. At the moment we are at the mercy of the owner and their timelines to fix issues. If a certain time lapses then we should have reduced rent as the property is not in full condition as agreed.
Improve agent performance
Real estate agent
High rental prices
"I have had no issues so far. Now that I am retired from work, I am worried that I might not get approved for rental if I ever have to move. Financially I am fine but still that fear as you get older."
Landlords need to have more rights 
"Real estate agents that actually care. I'm yet to come across an agent that doesn't have a ""churn and burn"" sort of approach to rentals. I've been in a lease signing where the agent literally said ""I've never been to the property, I don't know if you pay for water or not"" Turns out we not only pay for water but a share of the gas bill too. They couldn't tell us that at the lease signing but I promise you that they've never forgotten to send us an invoice!"
Lower the cost of renting and make it more affordable. Some rental property costs are extremely high for the quality attained.
Allowing me to make it more of my home by allowing me to paint walls and change drapes
returns for investors to be maintained
Less inspections and consistency in what is expected for a rental inspection
Repairs could be a little less expensive.
Agents should be more helpful and should actually care about their tenants' rights as well as benefit
Take off GST on commission paid.
Better management from real estate agency
Allowing tenants to have pets. 
I would like to see that properties are inspected by a licensed building inspector and any issues which are non compliant rectified and a safety certificate issued  before a tenant can move in.
I am a manager of six units in one complex and I do not agree that landlords should have to allow pets into the property
"Less frequent inspections, allowed to have animals."
The ability to remove bad tenants in a shorter period of time and the assistance given to property owners by the police.
"I think it works quite well, if the agent is good.  It can be hard to get necessary maintenance done with long term tenants"
Allow longer lease agreements - make it mandatory that the tenant gets access to more than 12 month lease if the tenant has done nothing wrong and the owner doesn't intend on living in the place.  There needs to be a legitimate reason for ending a 12 month lease.  I'm tired of having to move for no legitimate reason. 
"Respect from real estate and renter (works both ways)
More experience property managers in the job - don't know much about the Act
Discrimmination 
Honesty 

"
Shorter time for dispute resolution. Having to wait 3 weeks for someone to even look at a dispute is ridiculous. 
The premises need to be handed over to a new tenant in the same clean and good condition that is expected with a bond clean / exit report. If the house has been used by the owners or as a holiday rental it is often presented to a new tenant in a poorer condition than what is expected upon exit.
"Pets. As we have to spend years saving for a house deposit in the current market, its unreasonable to say that you cannot access a property at all because the owner decides they don't want pets. "
Stop paying water rates
There is a power imbalance where the owner has control over whether we live in a place for a long time or not. We're perfect tenants but we still have instability
"Allow pets, be able to hang things on walls "
Better legislation to protect rent sharing via AirBnB
Landlords repairing things in a timely manner that need repair 
"The price, as we are trying to sell our previous house in a different location and are therefore paying a mortgage & rent"
The Body Corporate experience has been very poor.
"That rent was not worked out on the value of the the land and building

Exit process.  The manager or landlord has all the control.  Unrealistic expectations set by manager/owners
"Cheaper rent, better real estate agents"
Punishment for unpaid bills & Damage
"Make properties pet friendly as a standard, allow tenants to make minor modifications to their living areas, and make sure that rental properties meet basic standards of living."
"Timely attention to maintenance requests
Minimal disruptions to the quiet enjoyment of the property when property is being marketed for sale"
"If a decision has to be made about the rental property, owner should have the right to make that decision "
Make tenants more accountable for the consequences of their neglect of basics. 
Stop rent being increased every time the contract is renewed. Allow minor improvements eg satilitte tv curtains gardens and fences allow visitors without informing the agent get repairs done quicker lower the rent as families have to have both parents working to survive which leaves the children missing out on family time. Have less invasive questions on the rental applications.    
More support and make it easier for owners when tenants damage and refuse to vacate. Enable a simple police action after all paperwork completed 
Getting hit with big bond claims on both of the last 2 vacancies. I went to QCAT both times and had the amount claimed reduced by quite a large amount but both different Real Estate agents seemed to just see it as the normal course of action. 
The ability to personalise a space if there was a long term lease in place
Allow Tenants to make it their own home. Pictures up without permission etc etc.
"There should be a cap on how much rents can be increased when renewing leases or some other type of regualtion. The main reason I decided to buy and stop renting was that I got sick of having to move every single year. Because each time a lease comes to an end, the property manager tries to increase the rent by an unreasonable amount knowing that you either have to accept it or leave (and I suspect they lie to the absentee owners about what is reasonable). You can try to negotiate, but they generally don't listen and the owner never knows that you tried to negotiate, so even if you're a great tenant they don't have the option to tell the manager to agree and keep you rather than risk the place being empty or getting a bad tenant. So you have to leave in order to find another place that isn't over-priced. And because the increase is unreasonable, they don't find a new tenant at that new price and end up dropping it back to what you were paying anyway. So both the tenant and the owner end up worse off! It's absolutely ridiculous!"
When the property as presented when the entry report is completed should be returned at the end of the lease in the same state with no expectation of improving the condition. Property Managers are not playing the game by the rules
"More freedom in terms of decorating inside the house, for example placing pictures etc on the walls, and the freedom to plant things in the garden without having to gain permission"
"I feel that sometimes there are too many visits, particularly when you are renting for a 6 months only. I recently rented an apartment for 6 months and the property manager asked for access on 5 occasions, for different reasons. 
I also don't understand the requirement to have the property professionally vacuumed or cleaned, when some people prefer to do the cleaning themselves and can do a better job than a professional team. I think the ""professional"" requirement should be removed. I agree with the fact that the properties should be left cleaned and vacuumed to a professional and high standard level. "
Real estate agents doing exit reports unfairly get out the white gloves...yet when they hand over the keys the state of the cleanliness property is terrible...when reported real estates do nothing
Increased powers (legislative and financial) for the Residential Tenancies Authority to monitor and police the behaviour of real estate agents.
I would like the rental agencies to be better at communicating to both partys and do the job they are paid to do
"Realestate agents rules , the continued increase of $5 to $10 each year when you are a good tenant and you are on a pension it gets really difficult."
Clear forms. I found it very difficult to understand the terminology and feel I would have a better understanding of my rights and obligations if the applications were written for individuals and not the industry.
The rent we pay that should include electric.
"improve the way tenants should respect the premises they live in.

Investment properties are expensive outlays for the property owner and the system for recovery of loss from tenants is a total failure. if the tenants is in arrears in rent and has left a mess the bond cannot cover the loss and the tribunal cannot make the tenant cough up the money. "
"Allowing pets at all/most rentals in Queensland. Each tenant has to pay a bond, which is an assurance that any damages or accidents can be fixed and rectified so as not to put the landlord or home-owner at risk. Having a pet is an extremely important part of life and improves well-being and quality of life, and with such a large portion of the population having/choosing to rent, it is an injustice that so many rental properties do not allow pets of any size or type. An application for pets is understandable and fair, and this combined with the bond that tenants pay, is a reasonable insurance for the home-owner that the tenant will take responsibility for their pet and look after the rental property. And with regards to noise, smell, or any other concerns arising regarding pets in rental properties, it is unfair to assume that all pets and pet-owners will cause these issues, so I believe that all rental properties should allow pets, and assume the better judgement of pet-owners, as there are many options for if an issue does arise (breach notices, bond withdrawal etc.) where in most cases, tenants/pet-owners are very willing to fix the breach or issue."
To be allowed to feel like when I rent it is my home and someone else's house.  I feel that it you have a small pet this should be acceptable and also to be able to put photos up on the wall (with care and consideration) so that it feels homely
Get ride of the surcharging on rates by councils
"Better vetting, blacklisting and penalties for tentants who abuse properties.  This will allow a quicker way to get tenants into properties."
Allow pets to more rental properties even if a higher bond is paid
Make sure both parties take pictures of any problems or defects and notes them in writing.
More protection when tenants are destroying properties and when landlords neglect maintenance
"Affordable renting and owners keep the property properly maintained, low income earners have a fixed rental agreement instead of increasing the rent every 6 to 12 months."
The ability to keep my pet without having to pay more or make other concessions (like longer leases).
"Agents claiming the full bond amount as soon as they are able, regardless of it being a legitimate claim - meaning that the tenant is the one that has to take action to get it all back. This practice means all the power is with the agent/owner, and that they are likely to yield more frequent deposit retention with this one act."
Real Estate Agents carrying out their obligations under the Act and owners being made aware of their obligations under the Act with respect to the standard of premises.  
Having all rental applications the same information for all real estates. Having a booklet to explain the requirements for the information. Stop owner discriminating against people on unemployment.
"I'm actually satisfied with current tenancy, but dissatisfied with previous tenancy. I believe the property managers (i.e. Agents) are far more of a problem than landlords. The number one thing I would like changed about current tenancy laws is 1. Term - It's impossible to settle and feel comfortable with 1 year tenancy agreements. I would like to see options for up to 5 years, and if there is a need by either tenant or landlord to break that long term agreement, then have a 6 month notification period (for both parties) rather than 2weeks for tenants and 2 months for landlords. That will create the stability that is desperately needed by tenants and give income guarantee's for landloards, which banks can also then rely on as stable income when carrying out income assessment.. so win / win for both parties. 2. Needs to be an agent ranking system and more avenues for tenants to seek redress. Even difficult Landlords are easy to deal with and find compromise compared to difficult agents. I have concerns that unless there is more accountability for agents, that any real attempt at rental reform will not work. Happy for someone to contact me and discuss this in more detail."
Cheaper rent! Prices have increased so much. Hard for people on low income too live 
"Easier lines of communication between Tennant, Property Manager & Property Owner"

Lower affordable rental prices
Have pets be accepted in all properties
Tenants to have more control over their living situation while renting a property (eg right to make small changes and privacy from landlord incursions onto property). 
"It would be good if the property manager showing you through a potential property could answer specific questions about the property. Quite often they do not know certain things about the property they are showing, for example if pets will be accepted, or if the water tank is plumbed. They expect us to go through the application process and only later they will contact the owner and ask the questions we need answered."

How often the owners can visit.
"Have set time frames for items to be fixed that are enforced.
Allow pets at properties
Allow pictures to be installed on walls.
Remove the carpet cleaning clauses of leases - every house that I have moved into have requested this, but it has not been done prior to us being there.
Agents currently request the house be ""spotless - like new"" for exit cleans. While I understand that legislation states that it must be clean, agents are taking this to a whole new level. There are even agents that incorporate that a paid bond clean be done to receive your refund into a lease."
"The fact that when we leave properties, the landlords are often charging for ""damages"" etc that are from previous tenants , or are just general wear and tear. The only option we have is to either take them to the tribunal. or let them rip us off. I have also had them charge me for repairs and when i returned to the property  4 months later those repairs were never done. Having spoken to numerous other people it appears to be a very common practise

"The cost of housing ( houses that are not even nice are expensive) also I have a large family and find most wont rent to us as we have over 3 Children. Market is limited and we have often had to pay to stay in hotels between rental properties (all of which owners have decided to sell) Have have roofs cave in on us entire kitchen and not fixed for us as we were moving out in 10 weeks and owners said they would fix after we moved out before they sold. Real estate did nothing to help. payed full rent and had to clean up mess ourselves. Have a great landlord now but only ok real estate. They remind us that they could get a higher rent for the property, We already pay top dollar for average house.  Landlord is amazing and we try to deal mainly with him direct apart from payments and inspections."
Being able to make small changes like putting hooks up to hange pictures without waiting for remission from the real estate or the owner.
The legislation needs to be more balanced.
Easier access to the knowing the rights of renters and landlords
"As a tenant I feel the time frame required for completion of entry reports is very slim. To facilitate obtaining keys a physical move and completion of a thorough entry report in 3 days is very tight.

As a Landlord I would consider reviewing the rules relating to Water Charging and Rates. In most other countries it is commonplace for the tenant to pay for waste removal and services to the property in full. "
Stricter rules around withholding amounts from renter's bonds for damages. 
"Pest control being required when tenants vacate at all times, we moved into a property filled with cockroaches and ants and had to do ourselves.  It was due to the way the previous tenants lived..
Carpets too, they were done but still filthy"
Reduce fees for council and utilities
More houses available to rent 
Incremental rent increases for no real reason or improvement to the property.
"Have an independent entry and exit inspection process, taking the bond out of the hands of real estate agents. This would make the process fair and impartial. "
Increase notice periods from renters vacating property.  Only 2 weeks notice to vacate from renter is not reasonable in comparison to landlords' requirement for 2 months.
Improve the standards that real estate agents and owners operate under. They are very slow to respond to issues and ignore the fact that repeated maintenance issues have to be raised so frequently.
That the real estate agents would actually do their jobs properly and fairly 
"Increase Tenants understanding they are renting a property in it's existing condition and don't expect renovations like ""The Block"""

The length of the Bond period when closing out a tenancy that hasn't gone so well could be 5 weeks instead of 4. Not that this happens a lot in my experience but it has taken place and would give slightly more coverage to the lessor.
"Limit annual rent increases to CPI or some market index. 
Establish a bond bank with the RTA to avoid having to cough up bond on a new place before you exit and get a refund of the old bond 
Stop anal agents giving tenants an entry reports with hundreds of photos attached and giving you 3 days to agree with it at the same time you're moving in and probably exiting somewhere else.
Stop agents justifying their agency fee by questioning the cleanliness of a house at exit, when the house is much cleaner than on entry, It happens all the time.

"'- Ability to adequately complain and have recourse against both property owners or real estate agents. 
- There should be an independent body regularly checking the condition of properties before they are allowed to be rented. I and many of my friends have lived in properties where the stove/oven had to be manually lit with a lighter. On one such occasion the oven filed with gas an I didn't realise when I went to light it. Consequently a huge fire ball came out of the oven and I ended up being taken to the Royal Brisbane in an Ambulance and spending time in the Burns unit. Despite the landlord being told that this event had occurred he still refused to get a new oven. As a student it took me some time to be able to afford to move again as I didn't have disposable income. 
I also moved into a property which I rented from Raywhite Real estate the place was infested with Mice, there were hundreds all through the walls of the property and you could hear them running around during the night. The deck to this property was also rotting they refused to have this fixed. Upon living the property I found out that they had not properly lodged the Bond paperwork and had ignored emails from the RTA. This meant that I was unable to get my bond money back. I was advised that I did not have any ability to take action unless I did it privately. "
"Easier forms and documentation
Checking and validating bond on line"
"Make the system fairer for Renters & Owner/Managers.
Stop the RTA from forcing issues to court by giving bad advice to renters.

Support Owners?managers when they win a court case but can't locate the Tenant."
"As a tenant, Real estate agencies do not provide agents for a tenant to help find suitable housing. The real estate agencies do not value great tenants and do nothing to help the tenant in the ""normal"" process of renting"
Less frequent inspections after 4-5 years renting the same property. 
Stop the $10 a year increase
The current legislation does favour the tenant more than the owner.  The tenant can get out of a lease by giving a Notice to Leave whenever they please and then it costs the owners more in legal costs to recover outstanding funds.  Most tenants do the right thing but you have other tenants who destroy properties and owners are left with a property that can not be re rented as well as huge financial burdens.  It is very hard for owners to get tenant's out of a property if they are doing the wrong thing with current legislation time frames.

"The bullying and harassment from Landlords and Rental Agencies. 
Laws need to be changed to  for more protect from rogue agents and their we will or your out mentality.
The whole we can enter your home at any time is just not regulated enough to protect tenants from rude and rogue agents at any time for anyone at any age. 
I have been told they will come any time they like and I dont have to be there.
If you disagree for normal everyday repairs I have had real estate agents say this and then comment they will not discuss this with me in future. end of story.
Pretty sure legislation dictates consultation ??????'
Short of changing the locks we are held to ransom and bullied as these agents will not differ to a time that suits you both. I don't want strangers poking around my home particularly flight teenage aggressors with pimply faces and bad attitudes !

I have had agents try to evict me when they cant look after the property properly and I ask for repairs to be done and to communicate appropriately, I''\m talking toilets that don't flush, leaking taps and a shower floor that was so badly decomposed and leaking through to the bottom floor I nearly went through it ???
I had to beg and then it was like OH dear we must get onto this  blah blah blah .
Agents and landlords need to answer to e better set of laws, and body and we should be able to have mediators that can action instructions by law to pull agents and landlords into line.
Its a mess and disgraceful!!!"
"Some organisation should check on accommodation available for cleanliness. but above all safety for tennants 
If you change accommodation,Bonds should carry over from one property to next as many of us do not have a second bond available. "
"Photos of properties, either online or at the agency, should be date-stamped and renewed for every new listing. The vast majority of properties we have viewed have had, as part of the property's advertising, photos that have been out-dated. In many instances, the photos have been years old."
I'd buy houses rather than units or townhouses - the Body Corporate fees are a killer in QLD!
"More flexible contracts in the tenant's favour. I would prefer continuous renting contract with a 3-month cancellation period for example, instead of these 3, 6, 12 month contracts. There is never any security of being able to live somewhere long term, and you can get kicked out for any reason by the landlord. Tenants need more rights, and appropriate time to find a new rental when needed, not being forced to pay rent until a new tenant is found when given appropriate notice, and what's with the 3-month house inspections? It's hard to find a rental with a pet (dog) and rarely can I hang up paintings (private rentals are more flexible)."
The owners are keeping the bond for house that you have rented for over 5 years as they don't accept general wear and tear.  General wear and tear needs to be defined.  The first inspection report that you take with photos should be lodged with the RTA as real estates loose it and don't accept yours if you don't have dates and time on the photos.  
Landlord to give tenants 3 months notice to terminate whether on fixed term or month to month arrangements.  Reasonable time is needed to find and negotiate another residence.

"An explanation of ‘CLEAN’ so that tenants and all property managers have the same standard.
Bond should be more than 4 weeks rent. Damages often cost more than the bond and an owner should not have to try to get damages covered by insurance. Insurance companies should have the same meaning for damages and list what would not be covered."
"A real and exact standardised guide to what needs to be completed upon exiting a property.  I have been ripped off so many times because I was led to believe that I ""had"" to have professionals do this and that and then pay the rent until all the work was completed even though I had fully moved out."
The vacate process of a tenant and notice period from an owner being 2 months and notice from a tenant only being 2 weeks. Even if there is a large debt the vacate process is incredibly tough on a landlord. The bond can be claimed by the tenant which results in QCAT for a Landlord or Agent to claim at least some of what is owed.

Ability to hang pictures on the wall. That repairs are carried out quickly.

Not having to inspect premises in person. This was very difficult when moving from interstate. 
A code of conduct for Realestate agents that encourages fair representation of renters and landlords
Being able to make our home feel like a home 
Clearer process for requesting repairs and maintenance. Higher minimum standard of quality for rentals. Allow pets by default.
Have tenants that don't wreck your place and also who don't skip out without paying their rent.
Frequency of inspections and automatic rent rises just because properties become scarce. With proven track record for care of property and promptness in paying on time.rented one property for 19 years through same landlord and had 3 rises in that time...... was no outlay for owner as we managed the general maintenance and repairs at our cost by agreement.
"tenants could be required to report problems as soon as they happen, to save further damage to the property"
Encourage institutional rental complexes rather than private investors for more long-term security.
That the owner completes repairs/maintenance on time and not ignore what needs to be done.
More available cheap housing 
"The landlords and home owners have high prejudice against younger couples.
I believe this needs to change as young people have children too and would like to have the same opportunities as older couples."
"It needs to be a fairer system to owners. Tenants can give 2 weeks notice on a periodic lease, owners have to give 2 months."
Longer tenancy periods
More thorough research on tenants before they move in. 
Property manages real estate agents can pretty much do what the want regardless of law.  I have rented in other states and am myself a landlord of a property. I have never witnessed this level of home invasion and harassment dishonesty displayed by property managers and real estate agents.  
"flexibility to break leases for legitimate reasons without being liable for the rent of the remainder of the lease (break up of relationship/marriage, interstate job offers, job losses)

pets

semi-permanent fixtures (shelves, cupboards, picture frames). rental apartments have notoriously bad storage space.

if the apartment was built with cheap and shoddy material in the first place i shouldn't be responsible if it breaks (e.g. towel rack screwed into chipboard, not into beams)"
Decrease the rent price (that likely wont happen haha).

"I live in Victoria and own two rental properties in Queensland.

The council rates I pay are extremely high compared to what I would pay in Victoria.

One of my tenants uses water with little regard and refuses to pay the extra usage which is passed onto me.

Foe me, these two concerns are a reason I am contemplating selling my properties.

1. Reduce  council rates as  it is extremely high
2. Pass on extra water usage charges to Tenant rather than expecting the Landlord to pay for it."
More allowance for pets and possibly for picture hanging and cosmetic changes 
Make agents more accountable for the actions they make.

That their is an income test to see if they can afford to rent their house out. To guarantee that issues that arise can be fixed as to the RTA standards. This ensures that issues are fixed and tenants aren't fighting to just get work done.
Make letting agents more accountable. I have found many agents do not communicate effectively with either the tenants or the landlords.
"The negotiation power of tenants is nule when renewing contracts.

Increments should be regulated not the the speculative price in the suburb but grounded researches.

Additionally property managers are not precisely prised for customer services, I would say 70% of them are focused in getting money and do not provide good services, hence a rating system for them should be appropriate in a centralised database."
The damage some people do to my property
Tenants need to be made more accountable for their treatment of other people’s properties.
"As a landlord with a strata unit, I am very disappointed with the experience of contacting the BCCM.  It is not necessarily the problem with the people I speak with, but the fact that as a lot owner we are powerless to have changes made with a self-managed body corporate.  Our current body corporate committee is not only let us down as lot owners but also our tenant, as she is being bullied by a committee member and anyone who visits our unit and it seems there is nothing we can do about it.  The committee refuses to address at all and it seems there is nothing we can do to address the issue, when there are no committee meetings held or response to our requests.  We will never purchase a strata unit again in Queensland, especially when it is too easy for self-management to occur by owners who have no clue and refuse to be compliant with the Act.  "
Owners being made to maintain their properties.
The RTA needs to provide more roadshows / forums in regional areas.
Give renters more power over their lives and homes.
More cheaper housing for older single women
Having more money to use on rental upgrade. Eg from 1 bedroom to 2 bedroom.
Houses can’t get sold while in a contract for renting
Real estate  cant sell the house while you have a contract and the force you out  
Stricter regulation of registered real estate agents. 
Keeping rent cheaper and more affordable and better service from real estate agents.
An end to periodic tenancies 
getting repairs done promptly
"Allow landlords the ability to evict tenants sooner who are behind in their rent and are damaging property, sooner and have rules in place to make tenants have to pay back money owed and not just allow them to get away with it. "
When moving out of a house it would be better if the inspections werent allowed to gappen until were out. Wr wouldnt normally let strangers into our house for an easy five finger discount so why should we because were moving? 
Not being able to get bond back until real estate signs off that all is well is frustrating at best as all to often agents are neither fair nor honest when it comes to this. Maybe this process could be handled by a third party? A non biased approach is always healthy
have more consequences for unprofessional property managers that don't know the law
1) Quality Standards of Rental properties. 2) Real Estate Agents lack of responsibility and aggressive attitude 
Have laws that make owners fix there propert to make them liveable example refused to fix front door that would not close was told to put something against it.
Easier to make landlord do repairs
After leaving a long term rental property owner should be responsible for a bond clean or a rebate should be given and not means tested to the tenant for paying for a bond clean. I have always been a very good tenant and no issues but just left a rental paying $545 per week including rent increases for six years and the house was very clean but I paid for a bond clean to ensure no issues which was very expensive. I feel this cost should be incurred by the owner.
Provide the new tenant with information from previous pest control. Have strict guidelines to protect the tenant. Have a compensation or review of rental amount to pay when agent is non compliant or does not fix things in a timely manner. Rta do not help resolve issues and no one has time to go to court. 
Owners should be bound by law to repair and maintain their rental property to a good standard.
"The law needs to changed to protect landlords. I have had negative experiences and the law protects the tennants.
It takes too long to evict tennants in breach. The govenrment allows utility companies such as electricity and phone to cut services if fees arent paid and to charge late fees. This should be extended to lessors. If a notice to remedy breach is not rectified then the law should be on the side of the complainant. "
"When applying through an agent, the agent should be required to present your application as soon as possible, rather than holding them back until they have a heap. As a Landlord I want to know I have applications, and as a tenant I want my application presented."
"1. The agents must not have a right to enter the home on any day and time they wish so long as they provide an entry notice
2. Have an ombudsman’s office to approach for families renting
3. More strict laws on agents acknowledging & rectifying repair requirements in the home
4. Make it compulsory for agents to provide a rental payment history to other agents when requested by an outgoing tenant
5. Make it compulsory that agents must not provide a negative reference for outgoing tenants to other agents"
Long term leases as standard
"Longer leases, up to 5 years or more"
 Tenants told when things are broken/ not working earlier rather than waiting till it's beyond repair or requiring immediate attention.
"Rental agents substandard. Can cause friction between two otherwise agreeable parties. 

Forms and processes are generally good, "
I would like it if you could secure a new rental before you give notice at your current rental. It’s very stressful not knowing if you will get a place in time.
"Rude property manager, 3mthly inspections even after 5years, rent increasing every lease and rental market gone so crazy can’t afford anywhere else"
Landlords whom believe they are able to complete repairs themselves and it takes them a year to get it complete.
Badly treated by Real estate agents 
There needs to be better protection for tenants on 'rooming agreements' it is far too easy for the 'landlord' to evict a tenant on a rooming agreement and leave them homeless. Any recourse available to the tenant takes time and is all to often too little too late. 
"Encourage longer leases
Allow for very minor alterations to property (I.e. hanging photos on walls)
Allow pets "
Nothing comes to mind
"TO ALLOW OWNER SAME OPTION WHEN PROVIDING NOTICE TO LEAVE AT THE END OF A FIXED TERM  EG: TENANTS ONLY NEED TO PROVIDE 14 DAYS AND OWNERS 60 DAYS
ALSO NEW REQUEST TO ALLOW  TENANTS TO NOT ASK PERMISSION FOR PETS OR ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO LIVE AT PROPERTY WOULD NOT BE IN BEST INTEREST TO LANDLORDS OR PROPERTY MANAGERS"
Honest and reliable realtor that does what they say when they say and don't increase rental every time your contract is due.
"Little things, like being able to hang pictures on the wall. Or paint a room.

Also being able to have a pet without having to ask for permission."
More focus on renters rights 
"Maybe being able to make a complaint without being vilified that you have bought attention to body corporate matters that normally go via the owner channels and made excuses for why it happened, when as a renter you could be breached and possibly evicted."
Longer / open-ended rental agreements. A publicly-available review process for landlords and rental agencies.
Agents and tere attitudes to renters.
"As a landlord, I would like to be able to evict destructive and/ or defaulting tenants more easily."
"That tenants pay proper respect for the property they are staying in, fix up the damage they create without any issues at their own expense, pay rent on time, don't sublet or bring pets if not allowed."
being able to transfer bond automatically when moving
Inspection process that the real estate agents have a set criteria. Not for them to decide what they want.
"I'm a low income earner in an NRAS apartment.  More options for me,  most places are bigger and more expensive for me. "
Larger bond and the landlord must have control over agreement to have animals in the rental property.
Unrealistic expectations and withholding bond money
"Less frequent inspections for long term good tenants who have had a spotless record. 3 months comes around quickly, I need to take time off work because I don't like strangers in my house alone. "
"Better, more respectful real estate agents. They treat tenants like second class citizens which is wrong."
"being able to transfer your bond and why is there no interest paid on this money?
enforcing landlords to repair and make the premises livable before they go on the market.Pretty much all taps and shower heads have built in inhibiters, so why is this a reason to charge tennants for water useage?"
Small property upkeeps
Maintenance being performed in a timely manner 
"Attitude of real estate agents who are patronizing and demeaning in their treatment of potential and actual tenants. 
Unfair and unrealistic check out process e.g. being called back to a property to pick up a leaf from the garden or you wont get your bond back!"
Cost is very high especially for someone on a pension
The realestate giving legal notice of entry. 
Should be allowed to have pets at any property.
More pet friendly options
"Overall renting has been fine. I found however that since becoming a single parent I feel I am judged and scrutinised. My current agency is disgusting! No communication, letters slide under the door. Emergency repairer not done and emails not responded to."
live closer to the rental property
"Slash the cost. We will literally never be able to afford our own home, because every last scrap of money goes into rent so we don't have any spare income to save up a deposit.  It's impossibly depressing."
repairs need to be done 
I am lucky to have found a long term rental close to family members but I do get anxious that at any time the owner could sell the unit and I'd have to move and it would be very difficult to find another property in my price range in my suburb. This is out of my control however.
Rent that was linked to the area or better amenities 
Sick of telling them every inspection what needs fixing and doesn't get done or does not want too. Why should some tenants get free pest control and I don't.
Tentants being treated as people.
more assistance to tenants with dodgy landlords
Stricter rules on how the bond return inspections/deductions are made
"More support for landlords, especially when there are consistent repairs needed and it appears to be obvious that it's not the building at fault but the people renting the building."
Being able to put pictures on the wall. Being able to have some general wear and tear that is acceptable and not have to be fixed by a tenant within reason. Being able to grow a veggie patch in the garden and making the garden your own. 
"Make tenancy agreements and inspections into a standard, simple online tool so history of property & tenancy can be clearly viewed and tracked."
Unreasonably high rent
Simplified accountability for damages to rental property over the value of bond. 
"Should be much more clear to both tenants and owners, for now real estate agents are bit of doggy with the things, especially when it comes to maintenance etc. 
rules shouldnt be in more favour of owners but a balance."
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A LIVEABLE OUTDOOR AREA 
Agents to be more accountable for letting tenants leave with bond when final inspection has not been completed
Improve rights for renters and make Body Corporates more accountable for resolving issues that occur on shared properties.
"I would appreciate if the property manager followed up better on things broken around the house. For the steep amount I am paying, I wished that all unique selling points with this house actually worked. SO many things that do not and the owner has zero interest in keeping up the maintenance of things."
The judgement from agents as soon as u say u have a pet or kids it immediately gets harder 
The right to have pets in any rental property as in Victoria. 
Make it quicker to remove tenants who damage property or do not pay rent.
"Have more say, landlord more accountable for property "
Centralised application processes that real estates can log into with applicants approval to source documentation. Applying through 5-10 different real estates with all their different criteria of what documentation they want is a huge pain. I've spent days creating applications. They need to be forced to use a centralised system to make the application process easier. 
Landlord fixes broken items. Sharing electricity cost with main house. Not having separate electricity meter. 
"As both a landlord and a renter, I believe pets should be allowed in all properties.  In my experience, pets do not cause any damage, and usually let damage than children."
"Nothing, I am satisfied with the current legislation. "
"Renting prices 
Customer service 
All properties have secure fencing "
Ban smoking on all areas of rental complexes
"Property Managers need to have some sort of qualification. They do not know how to deal with tenants, or the laws. "
Listening to tenants needs properly and actually meeting the landlord.  After all it is their property
"No photos during routine inspections, It’s a complete invasion of privacy to have our personal items photographed every 3-6 months. Pets have to be accepted, less inspections for long term tenants who have had no breeches. Agents must actually fill out entry condition reports rather than handing new tenants a blank one and expecting us to do their job, we should be able to add things but it certainly shouldn’t be blank to begin with when there’s clearly existing damage to the property and things left unclean."
Have a more open communication to get repairs done quicker. Not waiting weeks for something to be done. 
Lower rent prices 
Make owners and rental agents more accountable for repairs sooner as it becomes a problem when something needs fixing and it can takes weeks for it to actually happen.  There is a delay while the agent contacts the owner and then a delay about getting the repairer organised and then there is an expectation that the tenant can drop everything (including work) to be available when the repaired dictates.  There should be a more streamlined process for dealing with issues.  
"Make beneficial changes to the property, with approval of course. Being able to fix minor marks repairs etc without having to wait for ages, or replace old taps at my own expense "
Better communication between realestate and tenant 
Lower weekly rent 
Less inspections. Limit it it 2 a year. Unless damage has been seen in a previous inspection. 
"Less red tape - more decisions based on need and not just to fit mainstream i.e. having to allow access to a tradesman to install clips to window frames to hold cords from blinds in a house that has no children - because it’s the law.  The work wasn’t necessary, it cost the owner, and it was an inconvenience to the tenant.

Also a rental cap that fits the current market.  When market is high, rents become too high and people can’t afford them.  Owners continue to raise rent until a point where renters have to move out again because they can’t afford the rent, when market is low, owners struggle to find tenants...because there’s more competition for lower rent.  A fair cap should be maintained."
A penalty for owners to pay if repairs are not fixed
Body Corp bullies to be reigned in and made to follow the body corp laws with severe consequences for failure.
Allowing pets to.more fenced properties and rental properties that are more affordable 
The amount of paperwork that needs to be submitted to apply for a rental property. This information is collected every time. Can’t it be kept on a database? 
"Owners should fix their homes up 
Even if they live in another state
Don’t let buyers by a home that they never seen besides on the internet"
The way I'm treated by real estates.
Increase bonds or provide tenants access to insurance to cover damage
better communication from property managers
No so easy for dodgey real estates to black list people. Also more protection  for renters putting in complaints.
"Customer service, and respect to Tenants "
Requirement for agents to have formal training. Meet an agreed level of expertise in a relevant field.
Less inspections if complying to rental agreement
Allow Tenants to make the house a home
"Real estates need to have the same rules no matter what business they are with, or where they are. In my experiences my current real estate does whatever they want to do regardless of the impact on the tenant "
landlords willing to repair properties when needs to be done and not rely on just rent money 
After 2 inspections (at 3months and 6 months) decrease the inspection times to 6 monthly.  If there is seen to be a problem more inspections can be increased.  Don't lump all renters into the 'Bad' tenant group.  95% Most of the renters look after the properties they rent 
Shift power to the renter 
Owners involvement in weekly happenings. Bodycorp not responding to conditions
100% clarity and consistency on bond cleaning 
Property managers make this awful for tenants... they need proper training in how to deal with people 
The tenants and owners must have equal rights. What is good for one is good for the other. If a tenant rents a property then they should have no rights to demand changes immediately upon their occupation. If the property being advertised for rent is not up to code then the tenant should notify the RTA to inspect the property in question.
The laws are complex and difficult to adhere to even if you’re trying to do the right thing. 
Apply common-sense and compassion. Treat each case on it's merit.. Not a blanket policy. 
Being easier for tenants to have pets. But also more responsibility for tenants who have pets if they have damages.
I would make it easier to opted out of the rental agreement.
Ensuring a better resolution to help tennents have properties fixed when they need repair
Exit requirements after a tenancy and the level of ambiguity around what expectations are in place for tenants who are exiting
"secure a much longer lease term, say up to 60 months"
Being able to have a pet and longer leases because every 6 mths they put the rent up
The Real Estate Staff and Employers. 
"Similar to other States, continuing tenants should NOT be required to renew their agreement. Real-estate agents force the tenants to sign the agreement for every six months. Whereas the tenants may stay for another month or so after the fixed term. The tenants are require to pay to break the lease. The tenants’ rights are very poor. This system is very complex in this State."
"Generally my experience has been good but I keep informed of my rights and responsibilities and ensure that I, and my real estate, abide by these.  Personally, I would like to see a system where longer term tenants who have proven themselves to be trustworthy, are able to have longer gaps between inspections."
More properties allowing pets
Not allowing property managers to force you to use third party businesses to collect rent. This incurs an extra fee on top of rent. I would prefer just to direct debit the rent only into prop manager's account.
Government help for senior laies on very low income
Listen to the tenant and their actual needs
Wish have more flexibility of inspecions
"The managers who inspect the house for bond etc are usually 19 years of age and are telling you that you house is not up to THEIR standard but you see their car or the inside of their car and its dirty. I just think that they are nice to you to get you to rent their house then they turn nasty when you want to move out, I usually have to go to the rental bond authority and I usually win as they want the house to be brand new and not take into consideration of wear and tear which is unacceptable."
If an owner would like to list their rental property for sale then the tenant should have the option to terminate the tenancy. 
Number of home availble to take in Pets.
"Allow tenants to paint walls, hang pictures up and make the space feel like home, with the condition that they return the residence to its original condition on exit. "
"Maintenance of property done quicker.
"
For people renting the same property for years not to have house inspections every 3 months if they have had a great inspection report
The cost of rental prices and the way tenants are treated by real estate agents at the start and end of taking a lease.
Equality of renters to owners.
"Tighten rules around smoking in apartment complexes.
Easier process to make a complaint about property management."
"Affordability, safety & prompt attention to problems"
"Owners/ Agents & tentants give same time frames for vacating, instead of 60 days for owners & 2 weeks for tenants"
Property inspections and unreasonable rental increases 
Default on rental payment eviction time
I’m a long term renter & look after my place like it’s my own.  I get disheartened when my rent keeps increasing. 
Reduce frequency house inspections very intrusive.  Agents should always leave their business card when undertaking inspections. 
Better arrangements around maintenance
Having more to choose from for larger families and being allowed our dog
Better property management by agents. Better screening of tenants. An accessable database of tenants with proven bad records.
No rental increase unless work is done to the property 
"No longer let landlords refuse pets - if people can have children in a rental who are most destructive than a cat, why not allow pets? Pet owners need to be just as responsible as parents. "
Allow pets as we moved from Victoria and had to leave our cat behind.
"More public housing for retirees, costs to rent are too high. I just lost my wife of 47 years now can't afford renting, not through any fault of our own."
"I think that owners should recieve penalties for not keeping to their end lf the renting agreement, for example failing to do repairs in a timely manner. I also think until said things are done they should be disallowed to charge more rent and should face penalties if their answer is to evict tennants or fail to renew lease as an answer to remedy the breach."
Better lease as per rent increases and selling house from under you.
"More communication between tenants, property managers and landlords"
Not having to fight for my bond back with unreasonable realestate agents. Not the current realtor but certainly all of the previous 3
Allowing pets within reason 
"More flexibility, more time in between inspections, less time between rent increases"
Not have to deal with nasty real estate agencies.
"Mandatory inspection prior to applying for a property. This makes it very difficult when moving from a location that is distant. Most advertising for rental properties contains images of the entire property and anything that you would like to more specific about can be assisted by the agent.
Inspection times are also almost always during normal work hours which makes it very difficult for a working tenant to get to these."
Landlords actually fixing broken items or maintaining their properties 
No everything has been good with me renting .
Being able to make small modifications e.g. picture hook
More flexibility to make the property more homely 
The Method of BOND administration.
"There should be a job request portal that renters can submit a claim through for things to be fixed around the property, that way renters can see if a job request has been actioned or not. "
"All doors and security screens must be tested etc before being approved to rent.
"
Remove difficulties in having pets. 
"Allow pets. 
Some of us have lost our homes through no fault of our own.  Our pets are part of the family. 
We should not be forced to give them up just to have a roof over our heads. 
Landlords/owners to treat renters with respect,  as an equal and not a second class citizen. 
Just because we do not own a home does not mean we are less of a person. 
Maintenance to be attended in a timely manner "
How they respond to burglaries. We should be able to move fast if we are burgled in to. 
Cost of rentals is too high and quality of rentals does not match the outgoing costs for the rentals
Have owners do security upgrades 
All places on the Gold Coast should be mandatory to have at least ceiling fans and at least 1 room with air conditioning.
"The cost, I pay $420 a week for a basic 4 bedroom house, it's ridiculous and almost not affordable, I have quit my business due to illness so now its an existence I no longer have a life and struggling to pay basic bills.."
The manner of treatment of renters by agents.
"Pet policy of all renting agencies and individuals. Blankly saying not is ignorant.  

Large dogs if well trained should be allowed in very large properties, but not apartments, unless they are old."
Allowing to have any pet the tenants choose 
Flexibility and better neogatiation of rent
Renting price kept dropping due to over supply of apartment
Would like the tenants to take more responsibility in looking after the house and repair or replace items they use sometimes very harshly causing the items to malfunction.
"The quality of rental managers. The standards are so different, some are helpful and willing to get things fixed and others look to blame you for damage and expect you to manage and pay."
"Real estates, some are good some are bad. Previously rented with Coronis realty who were fantastic, now we rent with LJ Hooker and they are a nightmare. Pushy and rude, they want to breach us every 5 seconds, their communication sucks. "
Better property managers and decrease rent
"Owners that actually maintain and repair their properties.  Tennants should be able to negotiate with owners and not through agents (with protection laws).  Properties should not all be the same price regardless of area, they should rent according to condition."
The payment method.  They put an additional few dollars on top of the weekly rent just to process the funds which means I essentially pay for the administration fees which doesn’t seem fair.
I think there needs to be better standards for renting in Queensland - not charging a fortune for low-quality (and sometimes unsafe) houses; making it easier for tenants to have essential works completed on a house (instead of waiting months for a disinterested landlord to consent to spend money); it shouldn't be a struggle to find a house that allows pets; tenants should be able to hang pictures on the walls as long as the picture hook holes are small and repairable... landlords need to be accountable for their actions just as much as tenants - and tenants shouldn't be able to be blacklisted without evidence and formal correspondence being issued to allow them to know why they've been blacklisted and how they can resolve the issue. 
The cost of living. Mainly with power
More Pet friendly homes.
Responding to maintenance issues. Condition reports 
"understanding from the real estate about drought, and grass die due to no rain. house expections are an issue. maintain of parts of the rental. "
More notice for contract renewal.
The issue of getting rid of a problem/ non rent paying tenant because the process is too protracted even when adhering exactly to RTA guidelines. The tenant often remains in breach until QCAT can deal with the issue-then there is a period before the tenant can be forcibly evicted by the police if they don't comply with the order 
"Prevent landlord from claiming bond prior to final inspection. Make going to the QCAT to retrieve bond cost neutral to the tennant, or at least on an equal cost basis. We recently had to pay $300+ only to prevail at QCAT. The landlord had to pay nothing."
I often Feel the Real Estate works more for the tenant rather than the Landlord.  
Government should make up their mind about whether pets are allowable in rental properties and set suitable standards for pet owners.
Give Owners more of a say as it is there property that the tenants are living in.
"More rights for tenants, more support and clearer presence of tenant support organisations."
"Renters should be sent the vouchers for the council tip.
At the moment the owners get them as they are the rate payers yet we are the ones keeping their properties clean."
"Allow pets, be able to hang photos on the walls. be allowed to have another vehicle in the yard for restoration etc, have any repairs attended to quickly instead of having to wait long periods or repair by the tenant"
"As a tenant, you have no say in who the property manager is - which means you get lumped with some absolute shockers who take ages to return calls and emails, show complete disregard for the law and don't give a damn about the tenant."
Renting price and maintenance call backs 
"Further clarity on costs incurred on an early break lease.(be very clear on terms if a former tenant (e.g. moved location but still paying break lease rent) is to return to property months after handing in keys-  therefore has no property access, and be held responsible for neglected maintenance/ fallen palm fronds, pool maintenance etc). Transparency on this issue from real estate managers is lacking. 
Perhaps an RTA print sheet of all tenant responsibilities very simply stating what they are obligated to maintain....***but more pertinent***- that they ARE obligated to pay professional contractors to manage their empty break lease property(without option of remedy first). "
Have maintanance issues fix asap
Less frequent rental inspections. Rental inspections are intrusive and treat renters as children. 
limit rent increases
frequency of inspections; speed at which our owner responds to the agent
We were illegally placed on a ‘blacklist’ despite recieving all Bond money back etc. the process to apply to QTAC was too onerous and I had to move rural so the accessibility impacted on the ability to attain justice. The same agency had put heaps of people on a blacklist for no reason. 
"Give tenants more rights,"
"For the tangents able to have their pets.
Less competition when looking at a rental home.
The realestates not able to keep your bond money when they are being unreasonable.
Able to hang up pictures.
No three monthly inspections when the tenant looks after the property.
I find the RTA a waste of time as they are no help for the tenant, they say they are but they are in favour of the realestate."
"As a neighbour more rights in the Act, being able to apply to have tenants who behave badly removed from their property.  Having property managers and landlords held responsible for lack of action over neighbours complaints.  zero tollerance to disturbing neighbours and interferring with the quiet enjoyment of their property"
"Have landlords disclose their intentions when I sign a lease.
I move into a house hoping not to have to move again for 10 years but the owners wont tell you if they are going to require you to leave at the end of 1 year lease. 
When it costs nearly $4000 dollars and a great deal of stress to move house, nobody wants to do it every year."
Request median rental price on each location. 
No discrimination against pet owners
Nothing. Everything works really well. 
That maintenance requests were handled better/faster
"being able to have pets at the rental
able to enhance the the property within reason without permission
being able to hang pictures  to make it more homely"
Have a standard for liveable temperature (ie if the house heats/cools to a certain temperature then airconditioning/heating is mandatory)
"I have never had a problem renting, but I am in a higher income bracket than others. I would really like to remove discrimination from the renting process and take power from owners and put it in trained agents."
Allow pets regardless of breed and as a home owner pay the cost of NBN and bot pass it onto tenants. It's not fair. 
"I feel that decisions are very weighted to the property owner - we have requested access to NBN and been turned down, paint is chipping and tiles have cracked but we have been denied the improvements been made. Yet our rent goes up every year and we have three monthly inspections to check we are keeping things up to scratch (whoch we are impecciably)."
How easy it is to get out of a contract based on hardship. No negotiation needed for part payment or paying off rent and no proof of hardship required.
"how renters are treated by real estate agents, the right for renter to have pets indoors, a more transparent explanation of our rights as renters and the responsibilities of the property owner and agents.

it would be nice to be able to put things on the wall as well. i know thats a huge ask. "
"The RTA seem powerless to impose their recommendations on a land lord or Real Estate Agent leaving the renter helpless. 
Real Estate Agents who get frequent complaints about their bullying tactics need to be prosecutered or have their license revoked . "
To stop owners from over charging Rent on poor/bad condition property
I believe the tenant and property owner should be able to have a lease agreement for a longer period of 12 months that includes a rental review option which may include increase in rent or conditions of rent.
Ability to have pets and to have maintenance issues fixed 
Real estate agents aren't reliable.
"The list of expensive things you have to do when you move out. For example, receipts for professional carpet cleaning, pest control etc when we haven't viewed one before moving in. Ridiculous expectations when moving out, no understanding of wear & tear!"
Able to have pets and longer leases
Approved pets legislation
"Some real estate agent treat tenants like second class people, that needs changing. As well if things need fixing it should not be put on the bottom of the list. The expectation on leaving the rental nicer than when moved in in order to get bond back should be more realistic. There will be some wear and tear, and if some house owners don't keep up the maintenance, it won't improve the value of the property. I'm speaking of previous experience. 
My current house owner is the best I ever had. Very happy now renting there. He fixes things straight away and is approachable to requests (like putting in air conditioning etc.). If the owner looks after the tenant the tenant will look after the rental.

"
The rules need to be changed to protect landlords.  There is effectively no penalty for tenants who do the wrong thing.  The lease really only binds the landlord in the sense that the tenant can simply change their mind and walk away by claiming hardship.
"Have rental agents treat tenants like customers, with good customer service. "
Inspection criteria for selling rental premises 
To be treated better by the real estate.
"Tennants communicate with owners instead of property managers, to voice concerns about the property"
That owners can't make the call on what they consider essential for a tenant and property.
Quicker attention to repair requests. 
I would take the time to get to know the property manager better so that there was a relationship in place and that the landlord had a better understanding of who we are as tenants.
More cooperation when something around the house (broken due to normal wear and tear) needs fixing
Owner/agents maintaining properties promptly.
"Stop the rental agent to telling the rentals who to live while renting, change the rental prices that suite the house or unit that's being rented eg. paying over $600 for an OLD HOUSE is not on."
Lower costs and agents/owners from continuously pushing up the rent at the end of every lease until they push the renters out.
Having things fixed when needed. 
"allowing a small pet for company, especially for older people living alone"
"Part of the bond being able to be released with amount being disputed held until tribunal. 
If pool maintenance is included then that includes chemicals as well. 
Improve the process when properties are not being maintained. With long term renting there will be maintenence to keep property in line with standard when first rented. Many owners do not do regular maintenence that is not the tenants responsibility including trimming of trees above 3 metres. "
"Not allowed to have my well behaved, house-trained dogs in the house.
Landlord coming onto the property without going through the Real Estate agency."
"From a tenants perspective, renting with pets is extremely difficult if you are honest - most people lie. I'm in favour of landlords being unable to refuse a reasonable request to have pets. I've also seen clauses where we've been asked to sign documents saying our animals will be kept outside - this is unreasonable, and particularly in the case of cats encourages cats being outdoors (killing wildlife and roaming).

Similarly, I believe rather than requiring tenants to ask permission to put a picture hook up, they should instead be required to ""make good"" any holes. You cannot treat a rental like your home when you can't do so much as hang a painting.

From a landlord's perspective, it's too difficult to take action in case of non-payment of rent. Landlords risk personal financial ruin because of very relaxed rules whereby it is very difficult to evict a non-paying tenant."
Ensure tenants return a property in the condition in which they take it over in.
Landlords and Real Estate agents  to be not so negative to renters..some are really genuine renters who also care about and maintain the property as if their own.
Longer term leases (greater than 12 months) with fixed rental amounts / or reasonable rent increases 
"As a landlord, I'm quite happy with my experience thus far although not entirely satisfied with the service received from our property manager/s"
"High risk tenants should be known to the lessor , as a high risk tenant roll to help land lords avoid the trash in society/"
"I have dealt with some amazing agents however the agents in Toowoomba leave a lot to be desired.  The ones I have dealt with treat tenants as second rate citizens.  Many  advertised properties are far from what is described in advertisements, it would be nice if they could be honest.  "
"More affordable rent premiums. When we were looking for a property to rent, we looked at properties that were within our budget and they were just awful. We had to go to our absolute maximum of what we could pay before we could find a decent property. So our last dollar earned is budgeted for something, which does not allow for any increases in any living expenses and now our rent is going up $10.00/week, after only being here 6 months. This is going to make things difficult."
being easier to rent as a pet owner.
"If the real estate agents actually got back to you about issues you're having in the residence. 

If owners would approve repairs in a timely matter (the first house i rented - the floor was rotting away & the fence was kicked in by someone - both instances were immediately made known to the agent, but as far as I'm aware, the repairs still have not been done.. The second place i rented - the hot water system short circuited, they sent out an electrician to look at it - he told me that it was a fire hazard & needed immediate replacing - this was not going to be done at all until i threatened further action. There was also no oven in this dwelling - only hotplates. These literally exploded after i had been residing there for around 2 months. Again an electrician was sent to look at it, he told me again it was a fire hazard & not to use it. This was not approved for repair for 11 months. I had no way to cook for almost a whole year, because while yes, 1 of the hot plates was still ""functional"", it wasn't usable unless i wanted to burn the house down.. And in the place i am currently renting - there is a multitude of issues. All of which were made known to the real estate on our entry report. I've been here for almost 7 months now, & nothing at all has been done to remedy the issues, despite me continuing to report them every week.)"
Long term leases. Stable rent prices that don't increase every time a lease is renewed. More rights as to putting pictures on walls and having pets. 
Being allowed to have a pet AND pay a pet bond
Stop all contact with property owner/s outside of our realestate property management contact. So the owners can't just call when they like or visit the property without written notice through the realestate. Except for emergency repairs
"better communication with property managers and owners to be notified of issues of their property 
notification of entry into properties via emails or text messages
"
"To have access more easily to a web page to see if potential renters have not had their bond repaid, or if they have been evicted "
Real estate managers held to account for their actions AND a right of reply to tenant data bases as sometimes that info held is very wrong and impedes the rental application.
Maintainance issues. The last 2 houses I have rented from have had nothing but issues and because they aren’t an ‘emergency repair’ they don’t get fixed.
landlord informs me 90% of rent goes to gov fat cats
I don't like being treated like a second class citizen just because I rent
"More available long term lease agreements, 3 years +"
better accountability of owner/property manager to address issue
Letting the Renter allowed to trim trees and fix gardens or add gardens. 
Tenants expectations when vacating a property. I think they should have to have steam cleaning of carpets and curtains done professionally and also flea and tick treatments done if they have had pets regardless of what happened when they moved in. I am sick of getting to a new house and having to pay for these to be done and I don't think it's fair that the landlord pays either because they're not the ones who were living there. 
Landlords fixing problems
The ability to upgrade things in the apartment 
Owners being held responsible for there property being safe 
Ability to have affix items/furniture to walls etc.
Allowing more open rent agreements incase personal circumstances change and you need to move. If renting costs are going to continue to rise each time a lease is up for re-newel perhaps the owner could offer to pay the water bill
"Being allowed to have pets and put up pictures on walls...,also better response to maintenance requests "
Renters pay a letting fee but it feels like the real estate agents are only looking out for the interest of the owner and some use very dishonest tactics
Rent is too high for average people.
Real estate are like gatekeepers for owners. Owners decline repairs. Ongoing issues with multiple properties. 
"I have had terrible experiences renting privately especially being a single mother,was always treated like 2nd class citizen, even though I worked two jobs and never once had a bad renting history...I even went without HOT water for 2wks once ""the landlord  would not return my calls,and he would ""turn up anytime of the day/night and walk in to my yarz."
"Undue pressure to convert to ""rent card"" type schemes through reduction of other payment methods, only offering alternative payment methods that require additional costs to conduct, and/or creating difficult environments to perform payments via the restricted alternative payments"
Easier dispute channels for tenants so they are not discriminated by agencies
Timely and efficient process to approve and begin repairs (particularly with old houses)
More pet friendly rentals
"Easier to rent with dogs, ability to hang pictures & 6 monthly inspection if previous history of Good tenancy "
Allow pets unconditionally with no discrimnation against those with pets.
Private landords should be forced to obatain a real estate licence or appoint a licenced agent to ensure complaicne with legislation
"Real estate agents treat you like you’re an inconvenience. Whilst looking for a rental property, I had issues with real estates returning my calls.  My current real estate doesn’t follow up either."
Need internet connection at property
Quicker response to having maintenance repaired. 
Lower bank interest rates on investment loans (not just to those starting loans now)
"making being able to rent easier - Currently Real Estate Agents sit as unaccountable decision makers who do not allow renters and owners to communicate with each other and make decisions and then blame the other party (ie - ""the landlord has decided...""  or ""the tenant wants..."" and in almost every case in my experience - its really what the agent wants"
Allow pets so there are more rentals available. Most pet owners are responsible and shouldn’t have to get rid of their pets if circumstances force them to move house.
"The things you can do in the home, ie; aloud to put lace up when only having blinds, just always to make it feel more like your own home. Not have so many rules"
"Tenants need to feel that the property they live in is their home and not just a property.  In order to do this, things like allowing pictures to be hung, minor modifications suchas pay tv etc, pets need to be allowed.  Inspections need to be kept to a minimum once it is established that the tenant is caring for the property (perhaps inspections could be rated and once the tenants have achieved a certain rating over a given period, inspections could be conducted less frequently)."
"I would like the opportunity to negotiate lower rent if I am a good long term tenant, especially when the market changes and other rents go down."
Pets should be allowed in every suitable home and owners should not be allowed to stop your application based on pets.
Allow small contained pets in rental properties 
"Many dodgy landlords take bonds by cash and refuse to give receipt. It is hard to prove that they took the bonds, so at the end of lease they usually would not refund anything. Tried the RTA but the RTA could not help."
Communication between rental companies; tenants and owners.
The availability of affordable housing
Eviction of unsustainable tenants needs to be more efficient and cost effective for the landlord
Real estates being nicer to tenants. Being able to hang pictures up and being able to have pets. Being able to make it your home.
"Property Manager's / owners should be able to request a receipt for carpet cleaning. Whether a tenant gets it professionally cleaned or hires a carpet cleaning machine and does it themselves, they would have a receipt. For hygiene reasons, the next tenant moving into a property should be allowed to feel comfortable knowing the carpets were steam cleaned before they moved in.

There should be more rules about how much compensation can be requested by tenants for appliances etc that aren't working and Landlord's should be given a maximum time frame for repairs, before tenant's can claim compensation.

Tenant's should not be able to make a claim on their bond at the end of the tenancy. It's unfair that they pay a bond for damages etc and then at the end of the tenancy can put in a claim before the owner / property manager and then it's up to the owner / property manager to raise a dispute.

Should be able to request a Pet Bond for tenants with pets.

"
"Been renting at the same address for the past 21 years, have had great service by owner and agent. My rental experience dosen't need improving"
Mandating regular buliding maintenance as well as  prompt and approprtiate maintenance  as reported by tenants to Property Managers.
the rules if some tenant leave accommodation with out notice and behind in rent and the rules landlords have to go through to get there bond only. they can get another property put bond down and then claim bankrupt Then last landlord can do nothing to get rent as now in bankruptcy
A tenant should be aware that the property being offered is an investment or whether the property is on the market. Removal costs are far to expensive for short term rentals.
"Cheaper rental prices, LOL!"
"Prices on renting. If it were cheaper, I would be able to find a decent house to live in and feel comfortable."
Making pets for renters a non-negotiable. Enforcable timeframes for required maintenance
Be able to keep pets
"Remedy to breach does not require evidence at the moment. If the agent is (subjectively) reasonably convinced, the breach can be issued. For example, tenants can be breached for noise complaints from third parties when the agent has 'reasonable cause'. "
Rules relating to pets
Having a better real estate and having the option to go in and talk to someone at the RTA about my issues rather than calling up and getting the standard “fill out form 11” response 
"Increase the accountability of property managers. In real estate agencies, property managers are usually the entry positions and are often poorly trained, inexperienced and don't understand the importance of their role."
More power to Property Managers with damages to property at end of Tenancy Agreements 
"We lost our home and our rental house due the fallout after the GFC so we have experience in both areas. I am sad at my shortedness while I owned rentals houses. The worst thing for people renting is that they can be asked to move after the first lease runs out.  We've been asked to vacate the last two houses we've rented necessitating four moves within the last six years and it is unsettling and expensive. We unfortunately did this to people when we had rental houses and as owners we didn't consider the renters, we were only interested in our own financial plans. Now I realise that people who invest in the rental property have a responsibility to those people renting. They are real people and a very viable part of our society. I have a friend, a divorced mother of three, and she has just been asked to move again within the next four weeks. She has only been in the house for  a year and she is so worried about finding a another house near her children's schools and is asking will she be asked to move again from the next house she rents. She is a great renter, very tidy, spot on with her rent, just unfortunate to have rented houses where the people changed their financial plans. I have lived in Europe where the rentals market is taken very seriously and provides much greater legal protection for renters. It's time that Australia looked after that section of its society, after all the greatest proportion of people renting are decent 'you and me' people who want to live somewhere decent, raise their children and therefore have an interest in keeping the property they are renting decent as well."
If property managers and owners listen to tenants about what is going on and have some compassion when tenants are finding it hard to cope.
Renters should have more of a say than building managers and real estate agents. 
Rent cheaper..  If on centrelink.  Single you cant afford to live.  As all money is on rent.  And not money left for bills
6 month inspections rather than 3 monthly as when working full time and wanting to be present at the inspections it is very hard to organise time off.  I don't think people should be able to enter without you being present for security purposes.
Owner taking more responsibility for providing maintenance of property when required. 
Landlords are bound fo their contractual agreements as the tenants are.
"Real-estate being held accountable when they breach legislation (completing exit inspections a week and a half after lease end, handing over a filthy house but expecting one without a speck of dirt back, not giving entry notices, maintenance not being completed until they want to raise the rent, previous tenants still having a key, using the same entry inspection for years and then writing over the tenants comments or losing the report to try to force tenants to improve the property for then when they vacate, altering direct debit and rent amounts with forged signatures, resigning a person to a lease with no signature when they have documents removing them) "
Prevent high rent increases each renewal period.
"I'd like leases to be longer, with options for 5 or 10 year leases like Europe has."
Tenants that don't do the right thing are extremely hard to remove from your property. They have too many rights when they are not paying their rent it can take months to remove a person. Any bad tenant knows the system & how to play it.
Owners to fix and make repairs.
More freedom in relation to planting in the backyard
At times from some agents being treated like 2nd class citizens
Removing the notice to vacate without cause ability of the landlord at the end of the fixed term lease. The reason being it is extremely costly to move a family and no security is provided when this option exists and leases are generally only 12 months
Less power to landlords
"For the law concerning Bond Refunds to be changed to allow the Tenant the right to challenge Real Estate Agents refusing to refund Bonds.
Century 21 at Urangan (Hervey Bay) have a terrible record for refusing Bond refunds.
The Owner of the property is rarely consulted regarding the Bond refund.
I am 73 years of age and have rented properties all my life.
Century 21 Urangan  has the worst record for refusing Bond refunds.
"
The body corporate / building managers have let themselves into our apartment multiple times without prior consultation so it would be great if that never happens again!
"'- better communication between property managers and owners and tenants 
- property managers not at all aware of RTA protocols and procedures 
 "
Make it easier to get maintenance done and also have limits on rental increases for long term tenants. 
Less house inspections i think for the first year every 3months then as long as Property manager is happy with the property every 6months is acceptable. Less photos. Its very invasive to be taking extensive photos of the inside of the property every 3months. I always feel a little bit violated each time.
Real estate agents
"Having the right to say when property mangers and third party agents (e.g. smoke alarm inspections) can enter my home, instead of being given a date and no choice to change it."
"The landlord, the price for vale"
"Limit timing on water rate payments, my real estate agent tells me they can send me one whenever they like even over 12months later and I still have to pay it."
Be more careful in picking a place to live
More social housing with 99 year leases. 
"Introduce minimum standard for interior conditions, quality and state of the property. Many houses seem OK or even look very nice outside - but inside they are worn out, outdated and in poor condition, and have obviously been through many tenants without any interior renovations. "
Making aboriginal people take responsibility for their actions. Allowing pets in rental homes. 
"No increasing rents each year.
"
"More transparency between tenants, managers & owners.

Better response times by agents when tenants have issues, eg maintenance.

Additional financial support for those tenants who reside in more expensive rental areas, eg Gold Coast.

"
More freedom to the renter who leaves before the lease expires. Life happens as we go through it and I find the likely hood of an unoccupied home for Any significant time unlikely.
Immediate access to a cleaning bond (to cover professional clean/minor repairs) if property is not left in acceptable condition at end of lease (not a few days after end of lease) as prospective tenants are shown unclean property.
Prospects of making property affordable to everyone by restricting ownership numbers of rental properties. By allowing people to own numerous properties it increases property prices and traps people in the rental cycle.
"long term security - longer lease times (5, 7 10 years)"
"Real Estates should give tenants more choice on inspection times.






"
water usage charging. Back dating bills 10months and withholding bond until paid.
"Longer lease options, repairs to be done faster, pets to be able to live inside, quarterly inspection for long term tenants moved to 6 monthly "
Requiring landlords to carry out repairs 
The agent is usually the issue when i have had issues with renting 
"The cost of renting to too high, the competition (we are a family of 4 with a small dog). Couples generally get accepted over families. Lack of available homes to rent at an affordable price. Its very difficult and competitive to get a rental on the Gold Coast."
"Being able to make a HOME ..    Having access to property owner when requested.
Having  agents who advocate for the renter as well.  Not being treated as a second class citizen.."
"Estate Agents need to be more compassionate in regard to ""renters"" owning pets, in particular Cats."
"As a landlord, I have had tenants who damage my property beyond a cost covered by the bond. Twice, dogs have done considerable damage to wooden floors, screens on doors and in the garden.
I would like to be able to better protect my property."
Not allowing tenant to have pets
Landlords and property managers need to negotiate with renters on inspection access times not dictate them. 
"I cant change anything, it is up to the governing bodies to change legislations."
remove the need to complete multiple applications - maybe a centralised online application that agents could access would be helpful?
The managing agents to be compelled to provide open and transparent communication's between the owner and the agent. It is really unclear on who the agent works for as they tend to favour the tenants position many times.
Customer service at Real Estate
"Wouldn't it be great if there were incentives to being a 'good tenant'. There could be a matrix of factors (in order to try and be as objective as possible) which could include if rent is paid on time, tenant responds quickly and efficient, property is well maintained, if any enhancements are made or done by the tenant etc. It doesn't have to be financial incentives, it could be a known rating system to the tenant or scoring system. "
"Renters need to understand their obligations as a tenant in regard to cleanliness, damage, rent payments and living in a community environment with respect for other tenants"
"Allow pets in more properties! The ability to make small changes, like putting nails in walls would really help make my rental property feel like a home. "
"Current agency, efficient and no issues with getting things done.  Past experiences, slow in attending to maitenance issues, staff unhelpful, 
The thing I would like changed is a time frame for an agency to act on a maitenance issues/request."
That there is an equal balance between the needs of the tennent and landlord.
"1. Mechanism to complain against and provide feedback about dodgy real estate agents.
2. Visible pathways to raise voice against unjust and bullying practices by the rental real estate agents and companies"
"For my property manager to get repairs & other things done, I think she is too scared to ask my landlord to do things or it’s a matter of money!!!"
Clear cut simplified rental agreements.
I would like some security screens
Stop realestate agent from breaking the law.
Application process - too much like a competition
Make sure people are treated equal and reduce renting price
"Having tenants pay for their own water bills directly, similar to electricity."
The unwilling to help attitude you get from the real-estate agents When repairs are required.
A landlord who cared about their property
First time renters will have trouble showing proof of previous rentals. A more friendly system needs to be in place. 
Should allow at least one pet if property is compliant with local government and body corporate laws.
A bit more freedom in what can be done
"Having more privacy in with inspection 
Pets not being a basis of refusing an application. "
Availability of rentals allowing pets. 
"Correct advertising/photographs/conditions reports, these are usually misleading, old, and incorrect, wastes a lot of time viewing these proprties."
"The free reign agents & landlords have over the lives of tenants. If they take a dislike over a tenant they can mistreat & abuse them all they want. if they dont get their way, they simply lodge Notice to Leave without reason & even if tenant can prove it was retaliatory & tribunal quashes NTL, agents can re issue another immediately & make life 'hell' for tenants. If agent doing wrong & tenant reports them, a NTLw/oR is exactly what the will get. 

I & partner were subjected to bullying by a compulsive lying bully & had our lives & business shattered by this agent. i was too ill & missed the time frame to lodge paperwork & advised by lawyer that agent will continue to make life hell unless we left, after being there 7 years & when unable to use arms for months & during my fathers illness & subsequent death & i could not be interstate & visit him in hospital for the weeks before he died.   Then agent took all the bond through lies & the adjudicator did not allow enough time in the hearing for the complicated scenario plus i had requested adjournment for hearing which was denied & as i was suffering depression partially at hands of agent i became upset during hearing & lost focus & failed to prove agent lying & state my case properly & adjudicator made a math error in dividing bond & i just had to resign my case in frustration & agent walked away with all but $100 of bond, deceptively. 

A smart caring person could work out what i would suggest from my story.

I will never rent in QLD again. I have also been a landlord for 20 years & treat tenants more than fairly, yet out of 5 tenancies in QLD actually, they were all bad, woeful treatment by agent or landlord. 1 not so bad, just poor management of other tenants in building.

Lawyers advised Gold Coast has worse agents/landlords in Australia. i can say now though, not confined to GC.

Just as there is TICA for tenants, there absolutely needs to be a reporting body, capability about agents, staff of agents and landlords, so prospective tenants can obtain other tenants experience with 1. the property, 2. the agent, 3. the landlord. In fact just in relation to the property alone, there should be a try before you rent system, because a quick few minute view of the property does not in anyway alert you to the problems the property has, therefore the reporting as mentioned above would be the only way around this. 

It is far too easy for people to get into the real estate business. it is so full of young people with no idea or experience with renting themselves and absolutely no idea about property. I had a young girl tell me that a hole in the wall (that existed previously from a door knob hitting it) was 'structural damage'. 

I had an older agent (me as a landlord) look after the interior of the property upon inspections, but failed to take notice of much damage to the yard and surrounds, I am now left holding the bill due to lack of time to collate all the info & so many different quotes required, whilst trying to prepare the place for a new tenant & having to deal with caring for others that I do. Just not enough time to get things together for a hearing.

I say the above even though my son went into property management in his late teens & has done well, but without bias, he is an exception to the rule...he is smart, intelligent and cares, this is so very very rare. 

The agent I speak of that 'is' the compulsive liar...is the principal of the real estate we had to deal with, so making complaints to the agents was impossible, making complaints to the RTA which is what I had to finally do, saw us receive a NTL w/o Reason. During any hearings he lied about the reason...there was no real reason, he just didn't get his way & abused his authority over some one else life, who was ill and not strong enough physically or mentally at the time to fight it all the way. Who will never ever get to spend time with their dying father, who had to say goodbye to the family farm of 30 years, because they could not be there to help. Who was left with spinal issues & many other physical issues, to pack up the house & business equipment stored in the garage, but did not cope with it in the time frame provided & went through the humiliation of warrant of possession & the attitude of the police when I called them to say, I don't have an issue with handing over the keys, that is not the problem, just have all my possessions in front yard, in the rain, trying to pack them in trailer & get them to storage, by myself. Electronic equipment at that... in the rain...oh, point was...the police woman said...well you should have paid the rent....that was not the issue, my father being sick & dying was the main reason. How dare the police just assume unpaid rent is the sole reason a warrant of possession exists.

If agents are reported online for all to see, we can bypass any property advertised for rent by them & landlords would be able to pick and choose instead of having to go through bad experiences to find out if agent is any good or not.

Tenants should be able to by pass the agent to let the owner know just how the agent is acting.

Should be more vetting of real estate employees before getting job. Can't believe the age of 'senior' property managers with just no idea. Age should not be the issue though, yet intelligence & experience should. 

There was more, I am tired and have forgot, I hope more chance later in survey.

Should be able to lodge complaint about agent/landlord anonymously. So there can be no repercussions to tenant.

Should be able to lodge complaint about agent by landlord anonymously too.

Inspections are another area that are dismal. You either have an agent who insists on 3 monthly inspections for mature people who clearly take care of the property, then there are agents who do not do inspections at all, yet tell the landlord that they do & only find out at the end of the tenancy that there were clearly problems. Agents just seem not to be trusted.

So the agent I was under as a tenant, is/was a compulsive liar & the agent I had as a landlord was also a compulsive liar & I can prove both of my claims with written correspondence, yet at the busiest times of peoples lives, who has the time to locate, print, get stat decs etc etc etc in the time frames allocated.

I ended up referring to the tribunal & the rental system as a 'farce' in QLD, due to the agent being able to simply issue 2nd NTL w/o R after adjudicator quashing the first & because a 2 week NTL, does not correspond with the amount of time it takes to secure another property for a tenant.

If you want to go through the NRAS, they take 3 weeks just to process the application....let along, firstly finding a property, then wait 3 weeks, you have or don't have, if you are approved, only then you can prepare to leave current tenancy, if not have, you start over & just lost about 4 weeks minimum, by now you are on the street!!!!"
"Find out what you can about the landlord. If the property needs work when viewing, it won't get done if you move in. Deal with reputable Real Estate Agencies not directly with the owner."
Pet available accommodation 
long term leases so I wont have the fear of having to be moved out after a year
"Easier to access RTA for Rental Agency complaints. Our last real estate claimed a significant portion of the bond for no reason, but it was hard to dispute. Time and cost barriers were an issue."
Greater protection for tenants in terms of making improvements to the property that may affect health (e.g mould)
allowing tenants to make rent payments without bank fees or processing fees
"More rights when renting a house. I pay in excess of $730 a week but I cannot put a picture up, I cannot do anything in the house I pay to live in
I cannot have an outside dog or a cat 
We were having cold showers and in winter unbearable, we had been making requests to install a hot water heater for nearly 2 years and the owner kept refusing, last month we had to pay for the hot water heater and this will be deducted in small amounts of our rent. How is cold showers in a $730 rental fair even Bali has hot water

Overseas the renting market is so much fairer to those paying the money
Tenants really have no rights and you go to the tribunal and they rule in favour of the agents.  I had raw sewage coming through the drain the real estate fobbed it off, the council said not their problem and so it went on
The real estate agent constantly abused their rights and again the tribunal did nothing on one occasion the owner entered our house and did repairs without us knowing 
I film when I first move in as regardless of the entry report real estates want the property left better than when you moved in and are always trying to keep your bond
If I could afford to buy I would do it in a heart beat as it is that stressful renting"
Making it fair for both tenants & investors
More accountability for actions of tenants
"The agent should inspect very carefully of all houses/ units and townhouses before they let the tenant move in the property. The agent also should tell the tenant the truth if the property is in a good condition or not and let the tenant  decide whether they will proceed the leasing process or not.

It is very important that the kitchen and the toilet are hygienic because they are the most important part of the houses, units and townhouses.

It is very important that the agent should pay a high penalty of their mistake.

 



"
"Make it easier to apply for a rental property, have a central register with reference details to track both responsible and irresponsible tenants. "
Limit to how much a rent can be raised.
No option for agreements less than 12 months
Make it fairer for renters rather than the realestate having all the power. They seem to feel the bond is theirs.
"Make it easier to evict people failing to 1. look after the property, 2. do not pay rent on time, 3. do not folow by-Laws in in Unit complex"
less inspections and more freedom over what i can do with the house.

"The importance of what renting is, and the obligations of both tenants and owners needs to be clearer and enforcable."
Longer least options to offer more security
the amount of time it takes for things to be fixed
"Allowing pets in rentals
Allowing tenants to install picture hooks using proper methods"
"Take rental prices back to 1% market value, or at least put a cap on rental price/%value"
having realestate agents that arent bullies when they get something wrong - or make renting easier than non face to face - when issues arise communication is key
"Create a legitimate, enforceable penalties that can be applied against agents and landlords. Tenants are threatened with bond loss, fees for cleaning and maintenance without demonstration of proof, and loss of home (kicked out). Issuing a Breach Notice to an agent or landlord is a laughable exercise - they don't care as there is no real financial or performance penalty against them that is enforced. "
Smoking laws (second hand smoke)
The standards employed by some Property Managers to ensure that housing conditions are maintained to the satisfaction of both Landlord and tenant
Less inspection would be a great thing as to let you breathe from a constant intrusion by rental agencies coming into your home on a regular basis (every 12 weeks) you do not feel like you have your own private sanctuary to come home to relax in. They now enter your home after knocking once and without waiting for you to let them in. It is an absolute intrusion and highly offensive of them and very unsettling. 
Less inspections and rules
"To be able to have an open discussion with owner or real estate if wanting to change or alter something, when asking for example to have a pet. Instead of just a no be able to explain the circumstances and show that you are clean and can maintain the property. "
"For renting to be a neutral experience, real estate agents/property managers need to be able to be held accountable for their actions - more to the point inaction. Inspections not completed on time and/or rent allowed to be in arrears for too long all add to the problems when it finally comes to the crunch and tenants have to be given notice when it is then found the bond does not cover the owners for their losses. Timely intervention by the agent would prevent that and give owners peace of mind."
"Enforcing realestate agencies perform their duties within the time frames written in the tenancy agreement. Enforcing that realestate agencies also use the proper processes for maintenance and repairs. Enforce that vacant properties do not have construction on Sundays as well as before 6am, especially if the vacant property is in an apartment complex."
How often inspections are completed 
"We have spent a great deal of money on our investment property. It's something that we hope will help us gain wealth to retire. We do not want it trashed or damaged - we want to be protected with strong laws in place. With this in mind, we are strongly opposed to changes around the following: 

* Tenants being able to keep pets at a property without the owners consent
* Tenants being able to make modifications to a property without an owners approval
* Certain maintenance being able to be undertaken without the owners permission"
Limit the time property manager/owners have to complete maintenance requests 
Somehow make rent more affordable for the really LOW income renters.
"Tenants to remain in advance with rent. Many tenants will use up their bond by not paying their final month of rent which leaves nothing left for any cleaning or repairs.
The landlord is out of pocket."
"Tenants need to be able to hang pictures on the walls, and have pets."
"Digitise all the forms required, such as rental and bond agreements - having to print them off, fill them out manually, collate all these forms filled out by your housemates and then submit them is archaic and time-consuming."
Clearer guidelines for Real Estate agents when it comes to managing rental properties. Sales is taken seriously because that is where the big money is. People in charge of rentals don't seem to care that much about the owner from my experience. Grabbing money and not providing a good service. Almost yearly they get the annual financail summary wrong.
"It would be great to be allowed more freedoms such as pets, hanging pictures and furniture."
not so strict back ground and income checking for first time tenant
"Agents DO NOT treat renters as customers and ONLY refer to the owner. We have lived in two houses ($650 a week) and we have waited for repairs for months and months and nothing ever gets done. It is rude. If this was a car or any other appliance, this type of behaviour would not be tolerated, If we complain to the RTA - we get a black mark against our name and can't rent another property. It is shocking and unfair."
Agent should never accept or advertise rental until the property satisfies legal requirements.  Eg: security fly screens fitted to doors and windows. Door and Windows close correctly.
Real estates lack of knowledge or disregard of the RTRAA and the rights and obligations of both the tenant and the lesoor.
Better defined processes/procedures for property managers.
Improved and more consistent regulation between real estate agencies. Less grey areas on issues like pest control/mould appearing in rooms/maintenance. It is never clear what is the tenant supposed to do or pay for and real estate agencies take advantage over such greyness.
increase speed when dealing with issues through qcat
"Security of Lease,  always feeling like you may have to move if the property is sold and how hard it is to get bonds back.  "
Impose some level of responsibility on tenants - currently they are not held to account at all.  Pay rent assistance to landlords direct and penalise those who claim rent assistance but do not pay.
The weekly cost of renting a home is a great deal out of our weekly income.
more rights for the tenants and less power to the real estate agents 
More say with upgrades and maintenance to house
Be able to call a rental property home.
The experience has improved so much since I first rented I can't really think of much. Maybe there's a way to upload video of the property instead of inspections? Especially for long term tenants with a good rep?
More accountability for property managers
Laws to prosecute dodgy landlords who privately rent substandard homes to tenants.
"From my recent experience renting in QLD: when you rent from an agent you end up doing the work they are supposed to do. This includes making sure that the property is clean, safe and in working order. None of the above has been the case for the property I am renting, and despite having spent a lot of time seeking advice from RTA, issuing numerous forms my issues remain unresolved. I strongly feel that renters have no rights whatsoever, and are exposed to unfair actions form lessors and agents - while meeting their part of the tenancy agreement. "
A compulsory response from Real Estate Agents as they are our direct link to the home owner.
More rentals that allow pets
Better real estate that will actually communicate with you when there are serious problems with the property. Also allowing pets in all households like New South Wales has done
"Very inflexible leases. e.g. can't pay an amount to cancel lease - must pay monthly until room is filled/pay for advertising.
Haven't heard or experienced many real estates being fair on people when exiting, e.g. will claim full amount of bond from RTA when only small fees are quoted, making it difficult to protect yourself legally."
Have a history of property (i.e. any police action with previous tenants) available so that health of the building may be accessed.
"Periodic tenancy should be our option. Landlords are forcing us to renew our fixed leases or they give two months notice. This is wrong, it means we can not leave when we want to, or it can be problematic if we find work in another city"
the landlords being more proactive and takes more responsibility to maintain the condition of the unit.
"Clearer instructions on vacating cleaning,gardening and tree pruning, cleaning gutters"
"'-Better laws around the condition of properties that are being rented - mandatory safety inspections before new tenants etc.
-Better laws to allow people with pets - I worked for the RSPCA and in the veterinary industry for 10 years. I'm tired of killing people's pets because they couldn't find somewhere to live with them. 
- An easier way to report violate maintenance issues. Having to wait days, even weeks for an RTA hearing or dispute resolution doesn't work when there's a burst pipe in the roof the land lord refuses to fix. 
-Penalties for estate agents who don't follow the law"
More freedom for common sense in make a rental a home for parents and children. 
"Rent based on a percentage of your wage or capacity to pay (eg 1 tenant = % of rent).


"
"Make tenants have the water connected to the property, same as electricity, so they are responsible for the costs and not the owner."
"When reviewing a place check to see if switches, fans & exhaust fans work before signing up."
Having owners repair properties quicker
Real Estates have no reason to care about tenants. 
Increase rent 6 monthly or a least the option
How hard it is to find rental properties. Real estates don’t always use domain or realestate.com. You spend so long navigating around all the websites. Also it seems like there are more renters than rental properties. 
"Those that rent are renting for all different reasons & circumstances, with some being through no fault of their own.  
Everyone need to be treated like they are people and not like they are a nobody.
Not all people are good but the majority are so, each person should be treated with dignity and respect.  If you want to receive it, you have to give it."
there needs to be more balance in regards documented evidence that protect the tenant and the owner and the real estate agent.
Rules favor the landlord more than the tenant  .To many inspections per year.Two would be sufficient. 
"Real estate inspections every 3 months is too much.  I feel Like I have no privacy.  Taking pictures of the interior of my apartment is also taking away my right  to privacy of my home.
Inspection once a year, strictly in my presence and in time it suits me not real estate agency, would be reasonable. 
Renting period of 6 months is another dirty trick.  If the Rental agreement is not renewed tenant cannot appeal.  Renting period for residential apartments should be at least one year with the options for longer periods.  After all  both sides have right to cancel the contract and tenant has right to appeal against unfair cancellation of the contract. 
Comparison with Vic. and NSW law would be beneficial.  . "
"Stronger minimum standards of acceptability... Rental properties are often run down and renovated lazily.. Sometimes they're not even properly insulated!

Our own rental has a damaged asbestos roof the owner doesn't intend to replace, as such it's not really insulated anymore... It reaches 50° on most Summer days and can get so cold in Winter you actually loose feeling in your feet. The ""vent"" in the bathroom ceiling doesn't actually lead out through the roof... It just opens into the ceiling space, the bathroom quickly becomes coated with dust.. You sneeze ALL the time you shower and how can I be sure I'm not breathing in asbestos fibers?

The hot water system was faulty and we were paying hundreds more a quarter, we had to spend our own money to have this fixed, and were only reimbursed once we sent the real estate agency a report from the electrician who fixed it - surprise surprise, our bill was no longer sky rocketing and the system would no longer run empty...

To be honest I doubt it's any fault of the owner as we have only met them once, but the agency is very difficult... And sometimes we feel like they never discussed issues with the owner.."
"Stop giving so much power to tenants.  Owners take all the risk and tenants can do whatever they want with no REAL recourse (QCAT is a joke).  Why should tenants be allowed to continually breach a legal binding document,or not not pay or trash a house and get away with no repercussions, no financial penalties.  There is zero support for owners, its all about bleeding heart tenants."
Bond loans being available to those that are on working incomes. Even when working it can be difficult to come up with a large sum of monies to put down for bond. 
Addition of pets to the rental lease agreement
"Changes to how ""shared houses"" pay rent.. have gone through a couple of agencies that don't know how to manage individual payments from multiple tenants. "
Stop rent going up everyone I sign a new lease (has happened with each landlord)
Have a rental contract that allows a tenant to treat the property as their HOME and not a temporary residence that you stay at at the whim of the landlord.
An online rental form that tenants can click a check box to say yes i have received the inspection notice and there be a law to say that a person cannot come in unless that checkbox has been checked.  Obviously if the tenant has not checked the box within a week further attempts to make contact should be made.  Otherwise a tenant lives in fear of accidentally forgetting to check ones mailbox or email regularly or thoroughly enough and feeling terribly violated when someone forces an inspection when you havent cleaned to inspection standards.  We all live busy lives and whilst i am very clean our family got sick this winter and life stopped and the house became a mess.  What if we didnt get a notice intime and someone entered...how embarrassing. How violating.
"Allowing pets
Fast repairs "
I felt the Rental Agency was to slap happy and had a high turnover of staff / property managers
Better consideration for musicians in the eyes of the law. Being told I can't further my craft of 15 years practice in a place I call my home isn't terribly welcoming.
A little respect from the rental managers.
The all renters must get a professional clean and carpet clean upon vacate as its not fair to move into a property that isnt cleaned properly and you need to clean before you move in when you've arranged a bond clean at your old residence.
impoved communication with rental agents
"I am a owner and have on a lot of ocations had tenants stop paying rent and then leave without forwarding address leaving me to tidy house and loose rental erers
If RTA had more power to locate tenants and make them accountable would be great"
"Agents remembering that they are paid by the owner. No owner, no tenant, no rent, no commission."
some rules and regulations and renting fees
Estate Agents need to be better. 
"Keep rental prices down, stop constant increases, mandatory maintenace"
"The condition reporting,  it doesn't matter how much you clean or even if you hire professional cleaners the real estate agent always says that you have not cleaned and take your bond money.  "
"Be able to have framed photo's on walls, allow pets, maintenance to be completed, be able to put up our own blinds/curtains. We have been here 4.6 years, have asked several times for a ceiling fan in loungeroom, due to sun being on window in the afternoon and making room very hot, owner will not put one in, but has said we can if we pay for the fan and the installation. We are on pensions and can't afford. "
Being allowed to hang pictures and a little more privacey
"It appears to me that all laws introduced go the way of the tenant rather than the landlord.  It is the landlord that has a financial burden in this instance.  If something isn't changed to give the landlord less ""rules"" tenants may just find less properties to lease and exhorbitant rents."
Tax exemption when the family home is tenanted and the family is renting.
Greater accountability for landlords when health and safety risks are caused due to lack of maintenance 
That there is no evidence of discrimination of single mothers on a pension
"I think all rental properties should have solar power panels installed. 
With the on going in creasing price of rentals and electricity, it’s a hell of a burden. 
Would make a huge difference to people. "
Agent's taking urgent repair requests seriously and promptly completing works or updating tenant's on where the request is at all times through it's life cycle.
"I am a renter, I also work in community services and constantly deal with clients that have rental issues.  Real Estates in rural and remote areas seem to have total control of rules and agreements with regards to additional costs for tenants and unreasonable  exit requirements."
The cost of renting is high and as with any rent there is no certainty
Long term certainty 
"I would like to see the stability of rental properties increase. As it stand's it almost im possible to stay in one place for a reasonable amount of timing, forcing tennants to move every couple of years."
"Being a perfect Tenant, only to have Real Estates try to find every reason possible to keep my bond."
"More empowerment for renters. I feel like I have no power in so many circumstances, its unsettling. "
Real estate agent need to respect people more . We have experienced bullying tactics to increase our rent and we have been renting for over 20 years with never any complaints from owners or real estates .
"The certainty that things would be fixed, if you have a good landlord you are fine, if you have a terrible one you might as well move out. "
"Support for tenants in a dispute situation.
Property managers know the system backwards and some use that knowledge to intimidate tenants. "
Simplify the application process and the entry/exit reporting of the rental.
"Having an app that includes your lease agreement, upcoming inspections and an easy way to contact property manager. "
Find more certainty for future security.
Making sure the rental / real estate check the property thoroughly before new tenants move in
"My renting experience is as a landlord, not a tenant. It's clear that the way this survey is framed, the purpose of these reforms is to support tenants (not landlords). 

Anyway, if there is one thing I would want to change is a public register of serial renters who destroy rental properties. Every single landowner I know has had multiple experiences of renters who simply destroy units/homes, with no respect or regard to the property owner. Having gone through this so many times, I'll tell you something for free - the Queensland Tenancy laws is one sides and only support renters. There is simply no responsibility for these serial renters - once evicted, they just move to the next rental property, repeating their behaviour and destroying another property."
"Landlords treating you differently based on pet ownership. I don't have children, my pets are my family and I guarantee they do less damage than kids would. 

I have also had many realtors and landlords treat the end of lease process as a money-grab to get free repairs to their home by threatening the bond refund. "
"More Affordability in renting, Allowing people to have Pets (if they have a perfect rental History). More 1 Bed + Study with a Garage is needed. Owners need to ensure that they are keeping up their maintenance and not stealing tenants bonds for ""repairs"" and never actually doing repairs"
"Rent to be kept at affordable prices, especially for those on age /disability pension. "
Reduce frequency of inspections for long term tenants (2+ years?)
Allowing of pets that live Inside
"The Law should ensure that all rental properties are in a fit condition to be let, and all landlords and their rental agents should be aware of this.  Each property should be presented to renters a) clean and free of rubbish b) safe c) all appliances working d) as represented by the rental agents.  At present, many properties presented in the rental market are not fit to live in for a variety of reasons - especially they are not safe in that stairs and verandahs require repair, windows are not fitted properly, there are no safety requirements, like screen doors or indeed, insect screens for windows; the properties are often very dirty and the grounds neglected.  Stoves and air conditioners often do not work.  This basic requirement for any property should all be mandated as Law and landlords and agents be made aware that there are penalties for non-compliance.  At present, many agents tell tenants to ""take it or leave it, the landlord is difficult about fixing anything""."
Ensure Agents deal with issues correctly and timely
Ensure property managers provide appropriate and timely response before attending the property.
Owners of houses to be legally obliged to attend to maintenance issues 
Not having inspections every three months. I have lived in a property for 8years and I am sick of it. Yes to regular inspections but every few months is so over the top in my opinion.
"A tenant's right to negotiate the length of time between routine interim inspections.
I am inspected every 3 months, even though  I am a valued tenant who has never been breached once in 18 years in 7 different properties or lost a single $1 in bond refunds.It feels like an invasion of my privacy to be inspected so often.
I have friends who rent privately, and they have an inspection roughly once a year, as they are fabulous tenants too.
"
"The methodology in which Real Estate agents apply their mannerism to renters. Some agents attitudes are appalling, and make renters feel like they are beneath them."
Require a tenant to give more than 2 weeks notice
More flexible contracts - appear to highly favour the owner 
Longer rental terms
real estate more responive to maintanence
Have air conditioner in living area...check these things before leasing
More ownership over rental homes including being able to place some nails in the wall to hang photos. 
Being able to fix items onto the wall.  Make other changes to make living experience safe and enjoyable. 
More Picture hooks on the hall
Cheaper rent making it easier to collect a bond
"Accountability for landlords and real estate to actually fix things wrong with the house - they constantly ignore renters and let things get into a huge state of disrepair, and if you're too bothersome they do not renew your lease."
More pet-friendly options in all suburbs (not just houses in the outer suburbs)
Make the owners accountable to the RTA with $ penalties implied for breaching their duties as a landlord
Stop the discrimination towards responsible pet owners
The difficulty finding good tenants
Getting things fixed
"I'd like to be able to hang painting up without having to ask permission - making it feel like my home. I'd like to have inspections less frequently if I have a good record of inspections (ie. after 3 consecutive inspections, the rate drops to once every 6 months). "
Easier to find affordable housing and pet friendly housing for  good tenants 
Private rental to avoid the associated fees for the landlord
Owners of homes have no rights in regards to tenants taking & selling drugs within Queensland rental properties. 
"Property managers not being totally truthful, when sorting out the bond"
No restrictions on owning pets.
The attitude of the rental agents who think they can 'bully' and lie to you and basically treat you like scum because they can!
Owner needs to maintain property.
"Stop rents going up astronomically, this year mine went up $30 a week."
There is a power imbalance in favour of the landlord. This needs to be equalised
"A more proactive approach or system to make changes/apply for changes on the property. E.g. the process of asking for hooks on the wall, or maintenance on plumbing, has been an extremely drawn out process (going on 3 years to repair an ensuite toilet)."
Everything has gone pretty smoothly. 
"A tenant representative, online form lodgement portal to work around signatures on forms required for maintenance."
"When there's a job to be done in the unit, that it doesn't take so long to do it."
"Real Estate Agents - Property Managers. It seems that no matter if you are renting a $300 per week house or a $900 pw house, there is still a stigma about being a tenant. This is driven by poor training, low wages and an industry that cares little about the tenant. "
"1: Inspections- 1 per 1 year lease (last real estate I was at, done it every 3 months).
2: Cost of renting.
3: Real estate allowed to show new tenants through your house, when you are trying to move out."
Being able to put curtains up throughout the house. 
More communication between the tenant and property manager. Telling whether the property manager has changed or if the property has changed real estates. And a 48 maximum reply rate when not on holidays.
"Not having to pay to pay my rent
Less frequent house inspections"
"Ensure there is enough bond to cover the eviction process when a tenant stops paying rent.
This is a legislative failure because the minimum notice periods make it impossible to obtain a Warrant of Possession before the bond has been exhausted.
If notice periods remain the same - then the maximum bond would have to be increased - this is not ideal as it would impact affordability for the majority of tenants who do the right thing.
The best solution would be to reduce notice periods when a tenant stops paying rent, this would have zero impact on tenants who do the right thing.
"
That our house be pet friendly. As the add stated when we first applied for our rental. However the owner then changed their mind after we moved in when we asked for approval to adopt a cat.
tenants seem to get away with so much even when they have done the wrong thing but it always seem to go in their favour
The poor way in which tenants are treated by property agents.
"Better avenues for recovering expenses and unpaid rent from tenants who default. 
Easier to manage eviction of tenants who fail to pay rent or look after property."
Less housing inspections where the people renting have a good history
That the rent was less due to high cost of electricity etc it’s very hard to make ends meet each week.Leaving on a $10 a week for food is not a good life.
"For Landlords to give tenets a safe and secure home to rent, Owners  need to  given better tax breaks. This would only be available  for Australian  resident's  with an investment property, and not for overseas  investors. "
Have rental price increases controlled.
Tenant paying for a service
"If you are proven reliable tenants with references the application process could be quicker and less inspections after a year of renting the property, 2 a year."
Better communication between the real estate and the landlord(s)
Having more  rental properties available at a price a single person can afford 
Faster maintenance repairs 
If water is being charged at a property is must be disclosed in advertising of property
Having homes that are affordable to rent without needing constant repairs. Having affordable homes that have repairs and maintenance completed when required. Not being expected to return the home being rented in better condition than it was when moving in. Not have landlords being allowed to enter the premises when you are not home. Having the opportunity to rent long term for people who are unable to afford to purchase their own home due to low incomes.
deal with people that have some life experience instead of property managers that have not been in that situation themselves.
Tougher laws for private rentals and ability to get your bond back if you have all expenses paid for. Tougher laws for bond cleaners
Sound proofing between units
that real estate companies are held more accountable as they are lazy 
Allow tenants to have pets 
"sign a lease for 6 months as probation then go to ongoing.  Allows the renter to not be locked, probation gives the owner knowledge of the renter; and leases can be broken anyway so why commit to renewing leases. "
"More stable renting and realistic rental increases.
Less invasive house inspections more respect from real estate agents"
Having all problems fixed quicker.
"Having realestate agents and property managers and developers continually up selling rent. All of them hold no qualifications to push the markets the way they do. 90% of them drive the prices out of reachable levels to impress owners and to attract business. THAT IS A FACT......
It won't be long before renting will take two incomes to survive like a home loan, sadly in some areas it does."
Give tenants some rights to a comfortable home and stop rogue Agents from destroying lives
Not feeling like you’re a prisoner in a home you pay towards
Less frequent inspections
Being able to decorate and personalise the property 
"Once a tenant has had a year of three monthly routine inspections with no problems, I feel it should be enough to then have 6 monthly inspections - that is 2 a year."
Rental agent send warning for no reason ?
"Keep units free of pets.
Animals need space and units is too confined.
Tennants will not keep clean.
Animals leave odour and stains in the property."
To have no restrictions on keeping pets
Payment of water rates is now tenants responsibility.  This is fine when living in a unit but when in a house the tenant is to pay ALL the water costs to maintain the Landlords gardens and lawns. Distinctly unfair! 
Property Managers to have references or rating system so know if they are good.
"More respect as a tenant, less inspections"
More property management professional development. 
Owners that will maintain the house
I would love to make the house more home
"An agreement that is an agreement, not an ultimatum.  The tenant has no real bargaining power."
Real estate agents need to be more approachable 
Cheaper rentals for pensioners
Not having to worry about the negative consequences of making maintenance requests. 
"More accountability for owners and agents.  There are people out there renting out substandard properties with seemingly no accountability for maintenance and repairs. The agents seem to responsible only for ensuring the owner doesn't have to spend money on their properties. More often than not, at the end of the rental period the renter loses their bond over nonsense claims against them, but this money would rarely go into property improvement."
"Older residential neighbourhoods are being monopolized by investors. This results in an influx of low-social/economical groups that display antisocial behaviour in cheap housing areas, causing fear and disrupting the lives of new home owners, single income earners, people genuinely trying to save money.  Spread the unemployed and uneducated ppl around, so those that have nothing better to do than hoon and party all week aren't all concentrated in one area. "
Management that know what they are doing. Following up on emails. Telling tenants when they are not compliant.
Not having to move before lease ended so that the owner could move back in. 
Cheaper rent or rent assistance for single people 
Have real-estate agents not be so aggressive and be allowed to have a dog
"landlords greed, increasing rents by large amounts every 6 months.  Too afraid to ask for repairs as it seemed to directly influence the amount of rental increase."
Routine maintenance being done on time.
Longer time between inspections
Quicker response to maintenance
Reasonable landlords and agents.
"Housing affordability could improve so I can buy my own home, that would be a good start! But while I am renting, longer leases at a consistent rental cost would be better than having this terrible inconsistency where I don't know where I will live from year to year."
Being allowed to add more personal touches eg hanging pictures.
Better landlord rights 
Have long term leases so that you can stay in a house long term. At the moment leases are usually only a year at a time. Also that you are permitted to put pictures up on the walls and that you are allowed to have pets and not be restricted to keep them outside.
"Private landlords to be able to access, and actively participate, in register for tenants. It shouldn't require engagement of landlord to access TICA, or REA and other online listing avenues. "
Property managers need to be more attentive to tenant needs 
Honesty and integrity from property managers 
Long term contracts less inspections
"I'd like an arbitration organisation that could consider concerns that I havewith the listing agent. Most agents are concerned with making a dollar and not at all interested in problems that I have.
An independent authority would be helpful in determining what is the correct procedure to fixing disputes. It would only be required where there was a conflict. Issues that are resolved between parties doesn't require intervention from the arbitration."
"Force Agents to look at our ledgers and references and stop them insisting that we provide income and bank statements. We have 10 years of ledgers, and all bonds returned."
 The disruptive 3 month house inspections are invasive. We pay high rents. We need to be able to enjoy our privacy
It was a shock moving from NSW to QLD where a lot of agents try and do you for wear and tear to the property which could not possibly been done by yourself.  
Having tenants be solely responsible for the for damage caused to my property from them not just a percentage of the damage
I would change the rules on keeping pets. I think that all rentals should allow pets as they are an integral part of a persons life. 
Tenants need to have more rights and there needs to be more options for long term tenancies.
landlords having to complete maintainence not just get quotes
Lower rents to cope with daily living expenses 
Be allowed to make simple cosmetic changes to what is my home without pleading for permission. 
More community housing and also cheaper rental properties from realtors.  There should also be more street lighting in suburbs so that people feel safer when dark and more policing around the suburbs to stop hoons with their noisy cars and motorbikes late at night.
"Be provided with an option to sign an individual  tenancy agreement within a shared household. Agencies don't seem to offer it. Yet in today's society the majority of renters aren't close families. They're friends, or even aquantances in some cases. The only tenancy I ever had troubles in durimg my ten years of renting so far was one where one of the three people in the household got $3000 behind in their rent and continuously denied it and wouldn't show her bank statements. That added substantial anxiety to the other two residents including me, with constant threats from the agency about rent arrears, QCAT and potential tenancy database listing that could leading to difficulties accessing credit later in life.

Why would anyone want to rent when you can buy a place and not have to put up with garbage like that? "
Better care of tenants
"It's too expensive, no aircon, maintainence is difficult to arrange and no pets"
Some owners or realestate agents are awful and misbehave with the tenants. Therefore I'd like to hear the experiences about the owner or realestate agents from the previous tenant. 
"reduce the costs involved in vacating places eg pest control, carpet cleaning, bond cleaning water rates are a joke"
"The rental rule is unfair. Tenants wipl have to pay high cost to break the lease. On the other hand, the owner can sell the property during the lease and allow opem home inspection during the lease."
Being allowed to have pet's in more places.
"Nothing. But I am educated and a well paid, articulate professional. I have seen others treated badly because of poor communication."
efficient  leagal process if any party breach rental act
Honesty from landlords and agents 
More communication with agent or owner
Simpler way of understanding the rental system and ceasing of leases.
"Pets acceptance automatically- less abandoned pets
In case of loss of bond amount not being blacklisted- have never not been refunded in full myself but unfair to think one accidental damage can prevent people from renting again
Less constant check - at least 2 inspections annually is excessive"
The quality of the properties needs to be fixed 
Tighter tenancy laws to protect the owner - who has hundreds of thousands of dollars at risk and very little assurance from the govt that this investment will be protected.
Better quality propert mangers.
The repairs and maintenance on a property take far too long to be actioned.
Length of lease flexibility 
Easier applications and pet allowances
"Having bonds roll over to new rental properties. Having houses available earlier online. Allowing pets, even if outside would make renting easier. Finding a home for 2 dogs and a toddler can be hard! Even with 2 working parents/adults!"
"Websites advertising rental properties to have up to date photos supplied, not 5-6 etc years old."
To be allowed to hang paintings and to keep pets.
Make it easier  (less red tape ) for a private landlord to set up direct debit from    social security before money goes into tenants bank account. This can save a huge amount of stress on both the tenants and landlords lives. It helps to provide security on both sides. Many social security recipients struggle to budget their money and also meet their rental commitments. 
Fairer assessments around bond returns.
"I think we need to  keep the same policies in place 
this is my property the tenant need to ask permission for Pets, ETC "
longer rental agreements
More protection should be given to home owners.  The current rules are biased towards the tenant and it is making it increasingly difficult to take the risk of renting out a property.
Restrictions on pet ownership - so many so no pets but a lot of pets do less damage than people. Also entry notice rules - I've had tradesman in the house and not known about it (the real estate has told them that I knew they were coming) plus entry notices dropped in the mail box by the real estate late in the afternoon for the next day but the date of the form is 7 days ago because that's how much notice is supposed to have been given.
To have more freedom to make my house a home. And the guarantee of long term security
Would like to be able to sign a longer lease eg 5 years.
Fairer renting options for single persons.
More opportunity for owners to recoup expenses.
"Timeframe it takes to get approval. You are in limbo waiting to hear back from real estate agents. When you have to move you can't apply too early for properties as many aren't available till a certain date and you have a set date you have to move. Balancing these dates can be difficult and if you don't hear back promptly it is time wasted. Often you apply for multiple homes [even those you don't really like] just to make sure there is something to move into when your lease is up.
 "
The rental people treat all applicants like criminals and have limited sense of leway or justice. Allowing of a pet
"More properties to allow pets and in particular dogs. Lots of properties advertised say pets OK, but then say no to dogs. As a dog owner my choices on housing is limited. I also found rent to sometimes be higher where a dog is allowed, which is unfair as it then penalizes pet owners "
"The expectation that renters will live in a house without causing any minor marks or scuffs. I feel that the ""reasonable wear and tear"" condition is not at all reasonable. "
Allow Seniors to have a Pet. So many Seniors live alone and are lonely and as we all know a Pet can fill a void in ones live so much and allowing Seniors this luxury would help so many Seniors who are renting.
"A greater governing body, with more immediate power, that holds Real estate accountable for their actions. Something that provides more practical outcomes rather than just information."
"Allow superficial changes - eg. painting the walls, hanging pictures, etc. "
"Owners that don’t fix or repair stuff , mouldy carpets in my unit for 18 months plus washing machine mouldy too , real estate was too weak with the owner and never anything got fix "
No change is required we have a fair and balanced renting platform. 
"Communication from property manager to be improved, especially in actioning maintenance issues "
More flexibility to make it a home
"regulation of yearly rental increases. For instance, rental price cannot be increased by over a certain percentage. "
Land Tax on Rental properties and not on Owner homes. Cost just passed on to renters
More disclosure of possible tenant history of care of previous properties
"The requirements of the rental agent and their responsibility to the tenants.  I feel as though, through my experiences with property managers, that they have very little care factor for your living space and whether you need maintenance or not."
Allow pets. Respect privacy.
Stop ripping renters off for the sake of it... Owners and Property managers can breach their contracts without any punishment or retribution and renters have to suck it up. But if a renter doesnt pay on time or whatever they can breach notices etc.
Time frames for maintenance fixes. Price freeze on rent prices in a natural disaster area
Tenants to have more rights and it must be their home and treat it like their home .
Some Agents /Owners do not make renting a good experience.  constantly being harassed for rent even tho rent was paid weekly on due date as per contract and by scheduled Bankers transfer
it is almost impossible to find a rental property if you have pets
More consideration of privacy by the agent.
"All QLD property managers' have wide authorities range. Unfortunately, most of them have abused this authority. Thus, I think the authorities of QLD property managers' should be minimized. "
Easier to understand language on rights when renting (non legal jargon)
"I'm a landlord / property owner, I have allowed a tenant to keep a dog at my Birkdale property. I want to reserve the right to choose on a case by case basis. My property has been acquired through hard work, I do not want to have my rights taken away to allow tenants to make unauthorised changes or repairs to it in any way shape or form! "
Rent is too expensive in Cairns.  I am an owner who rents and I have instructed my Property Manager to keep our rent rate lower than the market value.
Quicker resolution of tenant/landlord issues.
"The need to view the property before signing a lease - this has made it very difficult when moving cities. If I'm prepared to commit to the contract without seeing the house and the consequences that might come from that, I don't see why the government or agent should prevent me. "
"'- To be able to be present for inspections and not be dictated to by the rental agency.
- Only photos of damage or wear and tear to be taken - too many personal items are photographed.
- To be able to influence priorities of items requiring maintenance.
- For maintenance to occur in a timely fashion.
"
More Government assistance for fixed income or lower income or aged renters.
"The ability to transfer bond between properties. Now that we have realtime payments and it's basically coming in and out of the same location, there's a real opportunity to automate this process where the landlord/rental agency agrees and the bond transfer is created - similar to how Airtasker do their payment of services."
Make tenants more accountable for their actions in a property. The legislation is very heavily leaning towards the tenant. 
Better laws on carpet replacement and hygiene standards from landlords 
"More flexibility for renters to allow pet ownership, better access by tenants to bond returns, limits to rent increases, faster responses and action for repairs.

My worst experiences in renting have been when previous landlords have treated my rental bond as their own private slush fund for general maintenance and renovations."
Communication. Understanding that it is very difficult when a Landlord can manage hundreds of properties - technology now provides significantly better ways to communicate and could be utilised better. Legislation access and communication had improved which is great
"The culture. Its is that rental properties are a business, an investment. There is no acknowledgement that it is also a HOME. Many restrictions (no pictures on the walls) reduce the home experience.
Rental agencies make a business of the bond cleaning.
I have lived in Germany, Netherlands, USA and Brazil. Queensland has been my worst experience so far. "
Communication and respect for the renter
The ability to make improvements like photo hooks and putting in side gates.
Tenants need to leave premises in same condition as it was provided and not be shocked when costs are sought to be recovered when the don't
Real Estate Agents must use recent photgraphs of properties
Make the Realestate and Landlords treat all tenants with dignity & Respect. Make landlords accountable for the condition and repairs of their Investment property.
Faster turnaround on maintenance requests and not being robbed of bond by dodgy real estate agents.
Better regulation of real estate agents - often they don't do their jobs properly especially in regard to organising repairs in a timely fashion.
I have only just this started renting out my 1st investment property so this is new to me however my main concern would be making sure tenants look after the property and are held accountable if damage is caused. 
Make bond payments transferrable between properties.
"I have been on unemployment for 3 years with injuries. I rented an old place for 12 years and had to move as the owner wanted to move back in. Since then I have rented some old duplexes that have been extremely overpriced because of the mining boom, then when it crashed I have been left with no job and trying to find cheaper accommodation. I ended up having to move towns and Real estate would not give my bond back, even throw the place was left in great condition. They did not care. Even broke my foot in the move and still would not help me, broke my foot falling down a hole in the yard I had to cover with pavers because real estate would not fix it. Point is Real estate wonder why renters smash places If we have been good tenants and they treat us like crap. "
More focussed and relevant training for professional property managers.
Tenants have rights but some people abuse their rights.  If they are seen to be doing the wrong thing faster action time is required.  People are loosing homes to banks just because tenants can not be moved on fast enough when they don't pay their rent and or cause damage.
Improvements to the timelines needed to be provided to tenants by agents when scheduled or planned remedial works are required. The current timelines are too short and skewed strong in favour of the agent and/or landlord
"Less properties per property manager so they have time to fairly service the tenant and the owner. So many property offices are understaffed and have too many rentals on their books, meaning they don’t have time. There should be regulated requirements of property managers work loads and response times etc. and management fees returned to owners if their contracts are not met."
Longevity of lease options and ability to change plants in my garden.
More support when owner decided to sell.  Owners looking after long term renters 
"The attitudes of Landlords renting directly to tenants.
The attitudes of Real Estate staff towards tenants.
We are not second class citizens and should not be treated as such.
The shaming by the above two and in general neighbours who own their own homes needs to be stopped. Women's circumstances can dramatically change and they can lose their homes and have no option but to rent."
Response and resolution times to general maintenance and repairs
I do not rent but own a rental property. 
"Being a new property owner I would welcome having more rights - e.g. ability to undertake more regular property inspections, ability to oncharge water service fees and also to collect water consumption deposits (along with rental payments)."
"As a property owner, have more rights over my property, e.g. allowance for more inspections, charging deposits for water consumption and have the ability to on-charge water service fees, etc."
Better oversight of smaller rental agencies/real estate agencies.
As a landlord/owner there is ZERO give strategies in place to handle disruptive pets in a rental - the increase in pet ownership leaves councils overworked and I’m very afraid of a potential change in policy regarding landlord rights to choose to allow pets or not .. I have had a number of intsances where my tenants animals have been noisy and disruptive and I have been totally unable to do anything about it.. and have incurred too many extra out of pocket costs when they vacate .. seems “wear and tear” for a pet is co siderednallowable despite them not being on a lease or agreed upon 
"Real Estate agents treat renters as second class citizens (even despite the fact most rent themselves).  Generally act as a blocker to dealing with owners (often don't pass on messages etc).  As a tenant your improvements to a property (cleaning up overgrown yards and improvements) often result in increased rent.  Owners need to work out what they want from tenants, someone who looks after a property or a property that is handed over as received.  Renting is a monopolisation of making money, from those who cannot afford to buy - reward system should be implemented for those who do the right thing. "
The lease should allow the current tenant an option to renew as part of the lease agreement. Like a business would have a 3x3 lease. This gives stabilty and certainty to the tenant who can't be ejected without good cause. This is assuming the property is kept in good condition. Long term leasing means the tenant can decorate house to be a home with more security.
tenants having more privacy and owners of properties having to actually do repairs
pass law's to force property owners to obey building codes
"recognition that in certain regions various social and personal circumstances do not allow for financial circumstances. Of families. Nor the stressors. It’s too expensive. The rental affordability scheme is a joke. There are houses everywhere around me and it’s too bloody hard to have a person give you a chance, people’s lifestyle choices to partake in get rich property investments really doesn’t do those of us who struggle each week to pay for that. Real estates are ruthless heArtless beast willing to be such for the fees and charges they fight for between others like them in order to be themselves survive. The housing dept policies well the opinion is that the government gives not one shit about it’s peoOle. You represent us yet look at you,, it appears that your view is that it is not proof enough that living in ones car isn’t good enough. Being told to lounge surf get a hotel 
It’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve had to do 

Find my family a home. "
At the moment it seems like most legislation is more in favour of the tenant. I believe this needs to be changed to be more even so if you have a difficult or problem tenant it is easier to evict them from the property
"Real Estates that share more information, I had a lot of trouble getting repairs done with my last real estate, with little or no feedback."
"Making rental applications more simple to submit. If you apply for multiple rental properties it is a lot of similar paperwork that could be maintained on one system, rather than each individual real estate's systems."
"Being allowed to have pets.

Being able to ask for things to be done without fear of the rent going up. "
"the bond refund/transfer process, currently you need to pay out an additional bond plus 2 weeks rent then only after leaving are you refunded you old bond. there should be a way of doing this without laying out so much money "
"knowing a bit about the owner, letting them know about us"
Making all homes pet friendly
Making it easier to find a suitable property to rent while owning dogs.
Better property managers
"Pets allowed 
Making the home our home "
"We are property owners not tenants and we have had fantastic tenants in the past BUT when you get tenants who are not following the terms, we feel property owners do not have enough rights when/if things go wrong."
Independent person to do entry and exit report 
Having a local advocate that could be approached on a face to face basis to help with dealing with the agent/Landlord would be a great help.
Fairer property managers the owner seems to be the priority instead of fair reasonable decisions for owner and renter
There needs to be longer leases and more leeway as to how rentals can be decorated and personalised.
"Past - ok but in this rental I have acquired a cat of which I advised the agent/owner and received unofficial approval. The cat is now my own and fully vetted and is an indoor-outdoor cat approx 7 y/o. But it is clear  that, as current laws stand, the cat will severely limit my rental options for the future. "
Overall very positive. Current system works well.
Water use fees - bias to tenant
I would not have purchased an investment property in Maroochydore which has resulted in a 20 percent decrease in value since 2017
"I have two nice rental properties. The last tenants in both properties damaged my properties and the bond did not cover the repairs by a large amount. It was also difficult to get any bond back to cover repairs due to vague terms for  ""wear and tear"". I do not call red paint splashed on my carpet or having to replace 18 month old hot plates as wear and tear. "
My renting experience would be improved with fewer inspections
The frequency of routine inspections
"There should be units that do not allow smoking inside or on the balconies as the smell comes through the doors and windows even when they are all closed.  There should be NO SMOKING ANYWHERE BUILDINGS, for people who like fresh air and no STINK in their units.  Also the breathing problems the smoke smell and fumes cause.  
These days all rental premises need to be DRUG tested before any new tenant moves in.  Renting because of drug people has now become very dangerous.
There should be NO SMOKING ANYWHERE BUILDINGS for PENSIONERS ONLY so they have peace of mind and can feel SAFE in their rental property and these properties should be inspected every 3 Months.
For tenants that don't and won't adhere to the NO SMOKING, NO LOUD MUSIC OR PARTIES RULES,they should be given a warning and if they do it again, they should be EVICTED.  Why should GOOD TENANTS have to SUFFER these people.
When you are renting in a block of units it really is frightening sometimes as you get tenants that smoke marijuana all the time and stink your home out and its no use complaining to the Landlord or the Agent as there is nothing they can do.  The Police come to the property, the drug addict says we are not smoking marijuana and the Police walk away. There has to be buildings for NON SMOKING, NON  DRUG USE tenants at reasonable rental rates."
Behaviour of rental agents towards tenants.
Being able to transfer bond from one property to another.
More rentals need to allow pets. Makes it very hard to find a new a home as a pet owner. 
Renting with pets is extremely difficult. Properties are very limited and rent seems higher in pet friendly properties.
"Having an onsite manager to resolve issues when they arrise, rather than having to wait days even weeks to hear back from the property manager."
The paperwork involved in renting is ridiculous and changes from one real estate to the next. There needs to be a standard form for all real estates. 
The lack of properties to choose from. 
Strengthen tenants resposibility for property to make it fairer for landlords 
Allow for terms longer than 2 years. We have had to move several times less than two years after moving in due to owner selling and new owner wanting to move in. The costs of moving and cleaning outweighed the benefits of renting.
How landlords treat you when they do inspections and I would like to see inspections change to 6 monthly
More freedom to change stuff in the house. 
Help from the real estate agent to get things fixed or updated from the landlord
"Cheaper two bedroom units
For single person"
Ability to have more negotiating power when it comes to making changes/improvements to the home. Longer lease terms. 
Having a ‘fee free’ way of paying rent
Ensure that once a tenant is behind in rent / hasn’t paid the water bills that action is taken immediately. If any damage is made to the property that the tenants pay. It appears “wear and tear” is an excuse used for everything which seems to let the tenant get away without covering damages they have done. 
Allow items to be attached to walls
I own rental properties and would prefer a better checking system on prospective tenants.
Availability of more properties to be pet friendly.
"1. Ban fixed term contracts - they are an absolute evil favoring rich landlords cashing up on tenants. We do have periodic tenancies available as an option, but every landlord says its not an option citing insurance conditions. Life does not happen on a select date - that new dream job does not find itself as per plan of end date on your tenancy agreement, kids don't get born as per that date. Life just happens, on any dates. Tenant may get a sudden need to move to another location 3 months into tenancy, or 9 or 8 or 15 months into tenancy - they should be able to do that with a 4 week notice, without being tied down by a contract that says they pay rent no matter what for remainder of they tenancy, that could be over a year away if signed on a 24 months lease. Such fixed term contracts should be completely outlawed. Normal periodic tenancy agreements should compulsory include a close that rent cannot be hiked for 24 months after move in. 
2. Change sale of property rules from 6 months after a new tenant moves in to 24 months after new tenant moves in. Property cannot be sold for 24 months since move in - unless landlord covers all costs incurred for moving in and out, including cleaning current and previous apartments, furniture movers etc, plus extra $$ compensation for inconvenience, and tenant agrees with all that. Current 6 month term is too weak - I've been in a situation twice in a row where spot on the day 6 month into tenancy they try and sell, at huge inconvenience to tenant.
3. Ban commercial cleaning requirements from being in contracts - self cleaning for everything should be enough.
4. Provide clear penalties system for landlords not fixing broken parts of the property - i.e. doors/windows/taps - say tenant can stop paying rent until fixed."
We struggled with houses being approved sight unseen before the inspection. You'd rearrange work to attend only to find they were cancelled due to an approval but there had been nil inspections. Very frustrating.
Having the issues I raise at house inspection time fixed
The ability to check tenants history more in depth before entering into an agreement - we had tenants who had business go bankrupt and owed money but no checks were able to discover this due to privacy. We ended up $6K out of pocket
The amount of paperwork required to apply for a rental.
"Being able to Place things on the walls. Posters, photos, ornaments etc

Being able to have pets without declaring first. You are discriminated as soon as you say you have a dog or cat

Longer leases (2 years)

Tougher penalties for owners turning up without notice

More rights to tenants in regards to entries and inspections limited to 6 monthly"
Cost of rent is very dependent on time of year meaning it's easy to get ripped off with inflated prices based on time of year. Safeguards and rights for renters need to be protected and upheld by agents. 
"Real Estate property managers have a habit of not sending notices of inspections of properties. I have noticed this not just with my agent but neighbours agents. And what they do is every time they have an inspection they just bring the keys along and if no one is there they legally enter the premisis. And if anyone questions them they simply say.... OH you mustn't have got the inspection notice. It's a common practice that needs to be stamped out. Just last week i questioned the agent as she emerged from my neighbours property when no one was home... Again same story... ""OH they mustn't have got the inspection notice"". They all do it..."
Not much to change apart from if you have a bad tennant they seem to have too many rights
Reduce the red tape involved in compelling tenants to meet their obligations under their tenancy agreement and associated legislation (Residential tenancies and rooming accommodation act)
"Pet friendly residences 
More protection for tenants when a house is for sale around inspections "
Ensure property owners have rights when real estate agent/property manager do the wrong thing
More communication with body corp
Flexibility of tenants to be able to make adjustments to houses e.g. putting up hooks for pictures or planting in garden beds. Also availability of pet friendly rentals
Freedom to make things ‘homely’
Allow pets if owner is responsible and shows it. 
"Allowance of pets, after 8 years of renting the same home. Inspections to be more infrequent. They are every 3 months and always different people coming in who seem to have no idea of wear and tear. 
"
I wish my landlord cares more about our needs and rights 
Property manager communication 
"More consideration for the tenant as a human being seeking a 'home' and not simply a cash-flow instrument to maximise profit for the owner and for the rental agency, more security of tenancy beyond the unilateral one year lease (no 'option' in GTA as found in commercial leases), more initial clarity and detail about the methodology used (if any) in the ongoing process of rent increase once the tenant is installed (and relatively trapped) when staying or moving are both frustratingly  losing and unpleasant options.,   "
Better communication and faster acting with maintenance 
"Owners wishing to view property without prior  notice.
Rental prices.
"
Enforce individual meters as mandatory in all units to ensure people are accountable for their usage!
"1. Prevent tenants from refusing to pay rent at the end of their lease so they can use up their bond money and leave the Landlord with no claim on damages.
2. Why not let the Dept of public housing take over the handling of rental money and bond payments between tenant and landlord if the Tenants are on Centrelink benefits. Thus guaranteeing the Landlord payment and damages compensation.  
"
"The rules on Pet's  
They should be allowed in rental property's, it is heartbreaking to give up pets  even hard when you are trying to surrender them as you can not have them as you are not allowed to have them and animal shelters are at maximum capacity and they turning you away.  This is why so many get either dumped on the side of the road or put down."
"As a private landlord it's difficult and/or expensive to gain access to the various tenancy databases to try to ascertain whether a prospective tenant has any complaints against them. It's also not easy to report a delinquent tenant as a private landlord. This significantly disadvantages private landlords when assessing tenants and gives bad tenants a ""free pass"" as private landlords in particular are unlikely to be able to report them. I propose that the RTA should be the maintainer of the official QLD tenancy database and searches and/or listings should be made simple and inexpensive for all landlords (commercial & private alike)."
"Be able to have small, fully caged and no nuisance pets (guinea pig) without rejection."
Not being discriminated for having house trained dogs.
"Pets being allowed to live. Having more freedom in regards to music, friends visiting and a bit of noise within reason "
More prompt responses to things that go wrong. Removing smoking (due to passive smoking) from rentals (outside and inside). Allowing tenants to have pets/making it easier.
Allowing pets and landlords acting upon maintenance requests
"Preventing tenants from doing a 'runner', ie leaving willfully and knowingly not paying rent and knowing it will so easily cost the landlord time and money that the case is eventually passed over. They should automatically be forced to pay their dues without putting added costs on the landlord.  "
More flexibility when it comes to pets 
"More freedom to be allowed to have paintings/photographs/artwork on the walls, even if this means using non permanent hooks. Would be nice to be able to add some personal touches to a rental property so it feels homely. We have very expensive artwork and professional portraits sitting in the closet as we are unable to hang anywhere."
Make renters more accountable for damage they cause.
The treatment of tenents when the house is for sale.
Too much red tape.
"Tenants can do far more damage to a property than the bond held. They can not pay rent to a certain point before you can issue a remedy to breach, then leave the property in such a state and the owner has no recourse because the bond covers the unpaid rent. Landlords get very little time to act but tenants get a lot of time to act. Tenants can damage the property eg iron burn on carpet, and can repair this by putting in a patch from carpet in the wardrobe. The wardrobe carpet can be left with a hole in it. If I accidentally damage someone's property I am legally responsible to fix it, if that means replace it I have to eg car bumper but tenants are subject to different rules."
The rents are unnecessarily expensive so I would like to see them frozen for 12 - 18 months and then a law put into place that they are not to rise over a certain amount on an annual basis.
I would like it to be much easier to find a decent property that allows pets. 
Agents allowed access to your home without you being present when doing an inspection 
Ability to make my rental feel more homely.  Clearer rental guidelines
"I would be much more happier if I was able to pay my rent through Bpay straight to my rental agency rather than having to go through a different company such as RE connect, that charges fees every month and also take money here and there just so I can pay for my rent it’s not fair "
"That if you put down for repairs to be done  and that the owner of the property decides they will not do the repairs, for eg.  I have a front door screen that will not keylock from the outside, and the only way it will close is if you pull it from the inside for the lock to activate.  I put in a repair advise to the Real estate only to have the owner, who I know personally come out tell me I can put up with it and do a unofficial inspection at the same time.  Also this owner is always  on holidays  (at my expense), but cannot do the repairs and also is wanting to put the rent up when they refuse to do repairs.  I believe that if repairs are needed that they legally cannot put the rent up anymore until they do their repairs.  They are supposed to put away a certain amount each fortnight for said repairs, but this owner has done absolutely no repairs for well over a year and now wants to put the rent up."
Longer and more flexible leases 
"Affordable rent
Don’t discriminate against young people "
More rights and protection for the Landlord
Having Pets inside and able to hang pictures
Having open homes outside business hours.
Real estate agents should learn to be more understanding and less intimidating.
"Allowing tenants more control of the property they pay to reside in - ability to keep pets, ability to hang paintings, paint walls/make cosmetic changes. Think it is fine to expect tenants to pay for any damage created (holes in walls etc), but think these changes should be allowed without tenants having to seek constant permission. "
more security of long term renting
The fact that most owners will not allow inside dogs and never specify this on the rental agreement until you have signed the lease.
"Not having to worry about pets.
Paying water, state and local charges.
I feel we should only have to pay once."
Communication with the  rental ageny staff  could be improved significantly by having consistent staff to communicate with and having  staff show positive and effective communication skills 
"Better communication with the realestate. We have been in our current property for 3 years and have had 7 property managers, all who have no idea about previous information that the old property manger knew of."
"60 day cooling off period...noisy neighbour
"
Being allowed to place paintings and photos on the walls.
"I am not a tenant, I am a home owner and I have an investment property.
In my experience, agents don't look after the landlords, they look after the tenants"
Large yearly rental increases giving you no choice to move to a cheaper place which is not a cheap exercise.
When it comes to town houses and units ownership of dogs should be only for the elderly and the disabled. Dogs in units and town houses that do not have access to a yard are excreting on outdoor deck areas which can be adjoining other units. This continue use of a deck area for gigs peeing and poohing is offensive. As a renter I’m am turned off a property if I know that it has pets in in. Doesn’t matter what you do you cannot get rid of pet smells from the exterior or interior. Also the problem with barking when owner is out... very very irritating 
The inconsistencies with the different Property Managers.
"Easier to find rental houses that allow pets 

"
"First and foremost, I'd abolish no pet policies.
I ersonally wouldn't mind paying an additional pet bond in order to be allowed to keep a pet."
The price and being able to make the place a home with adding photos etc 
haven't had any real bad experiences yet
Renters rights to demand damage/ repairs to properties at completed & completed in a timely manner
Stop landlords increasing rents without performing any improvement.
would require longer notice from tenants for leaving
Allowing pets in more premises. The emotional bond between people and their pets is so important for mental health and so many people are forced to choose between a home and their loved one.
"Quality assurance when entering a tenancy, have a same standard when viewing, leasing, and entering a property. Having tenant ledgers being standard from real estate to real estate; being sent out to tenants on a regular basis; and easy for all tenant to understand. "
"Make landlords be more transparent in how much bills included in rent are costing them, since the RTA states landlords can only charge what they are billed."
Restrict agents from claiming 100% bond unless they have supporting documents. Provide agents with rules around how long they take to action bond refunds.
OWNERS THAT DO REPAIRS ON TIME
Less frequent rental inspections
Checks on property managers that they are doing the right thing by owners and tenants.
more freedom to personalize the living areas within my home
More places that allow pets 
Have the water in my name like Victoria 
"Polite and a respectful attitude from property managers, more urgency on issues of broken or faulty items. "
"More available, cheaper accomodations"
Make it easier to evict tenants who are in breach.
For owners to not be allowed to reject tenants for having pets. Small children do just as much damage and they don't get discriminated against the same way pets do. 
"Less waiting time to move in.
Allow pets. "
Allow pets in all rentals.
"Pets are part of family life, and it's far too difficult to find a rental property that accepts them."
The amount the property is inspected 
Give the renter the respect they deserve as the Funder of the landlords property. E.g. full rights of use equivalent to the owner.
"Quicker responses to maintenance and enquiries. 
"
"Being fair,it feels like each time trying to get your bond back  they find the the smallest Thing unless I've struck bad real-estate"
As a property owner the tenants have more rights. This is unfair. 
Maybe quicker response to maintance doing repairs
"Allow dogs
Many owners state no pets and the houses that allow pets don’t usually suit the family needs"
Modifying the no pretty policy to allow small pets. 
"When something breaks down eg the air conditioner, it needs to be fixed within 24 hours not several months"
Improvements to Landlords rights
Tenants have responsibilities for damage and neglect they cause to property and furnishings 
Landlord that fixes things. 
"Being allowed to actually have the same rights and quality of life as home owners. After all, renters are the reason the landlord can afford to keep an investment property. "
Longer rental agreements with CPI rent increases 
"I feel fair wear and tear needs to be cleared up as I have first hand experience where bad tenants have left me with no recourse even with landlords insurance. If the rules change more loosely towards allowing tenants free reign to make minor mods with no agreement, have pets with no recourse for increased wear and tear. Do you think rent won't go up in price? Cos it will and if it doesn't I am out the rental game"
Encourage people to work 
The owner should pay to have repair work done by professional people not the body corporate personal 
"Being able to have animals, I think that animals make the the family and also people will be a lot happier."
Being appreciated for being a long term renter who takes pride in the home eg. approved pets and trust.
Need for a reform in how landlords rent their units. There should be a body set up to expose all the bad landlords and start fining them for their failures.
"Allow renters yo be able to keep their pets when they move between properties. I had to givd up 2 dogs, 2 cats, 2 birds after marriave break up. Even though the pets came with renyal references. No-one wouod take a single mum, with pets. Get rid of pets off application and instantly approved. There would be thousands less surrended animals to RSPCA shelters if pets were protected for owners, when moving. "
Finding a place with a pet to be much easier
Minimum 6 monthly inspections.
Make it mandatory for a cooling off period with the rental especially when the owner will not fix and repair issues with the house.
Same price to bring my small dog.
Pets allowed at any house
Routine inspection  time extended to every 6 or 12 mths for good long term tennents 
The real estate's customer service.
More flexibility with existing my lease
Parking for 2 bedroom apartments to have two spaces so we dont have to park on the street
To introduce a yearly cap for rental payment increases.
More respect and rights for tenants. I often feel the owners don’t care about us but we don’t have the autonomy to make decisions about our home because we don’t own it 
"Stop the Rent going up more then the Pension, it goes up $10 per year but we don't get a $10 increase in the pension so we are falling behind and below the poverty line."
End of lease process
Better real estate agent regulation 
All maintenance and problems to be fixed before you move in 
"Pets allowed, cheaper rent prices"
Choose an excellent property manager.
Not be judged on the amount a children or pets
Pet friendly accomm
"Being able to treat a rental more like a home. Hanging photos on walls, easier to have pets,  installing curtains etc"
Let renters have some rights. The owners and real estates seem to have all the power. Why do real estates have the right to come into my home. Take pictures. Go in my cupboards. No privacy at all! 
Be able to hang family photos and pictures on walls.
Being allowed to put Pictures on the walls
If things were fixed quickly.
More transparent vetting system for problem tenants

No need for special approval for pets
"Have a longer lease duration than 12 months, such as 2 - 5 years, with an option or a clause for the landlord to increase the rent upto the CPI growth of each year."
"Pet friendly which means pets can be inside. 

"

All.properties allow pets
Allow for bonds to be more than 4 weeks rent
"Introduce a system where a long term  tennant has greater visibility as to landlord’s intension to re rent, sell or inform tenants to vacate property, Every new lease agreement can be stressful time of uncertainty."
Never Rented. Moved Straight out of home into a property I brought 
"Better communication from the manager, for example to send out notices when water will be turned off. "
"Landlords/agents could do a better job ensuring that the property is fully fit for purpose in so far as nothing needs repair such as taps, stoves and other fixtures and fittings. Its frustrating to move into a supposed clean functional(?)property only to find shortcomings and then have to enter the repair/replace merry go round. "
Tenants liable for damage to an amount greater than their bond.
More affordable options for single seniors
Cost of house insurance in many Queensland houses is high. 
More Pet friendly properties 
"Long-term leases, allowances to change/improve property, pet-friendly. "
A much more positive relationship with the landlords and real estate agencies. It would also be nice to be allowed to secure our furniture so our child does not get killed by falling bookcases etc 
Houses need to have regular checks to make sure they meet acceptable living standards. Not just inspections to make sure the tenants aren't destroying the house. And old rental properties need to be brought up to current building codes. 
"There has to more protection in place for landlords.As they are taking on all the risk ,taking out a mortgage."
Routine inspections every 3 months is too often
Longer term leases
getting bond returned some RE offices think when you pay your bond its theirs as a bonus 
Better communication from real estate 
"I would like to not feel second class just because I rent. I would like to have a pet, specifically a dog. "
Agents need to be responsible for managing tenants and accountable for damage/loss if found to be not properly monitoring tenancies.
"Change the 7 day grace period for rental arrears to 2 days. Every tenant is aware that they can be 7 days behind in there rent with no penalty whatsoever. consequently many do, using the landlord as a bank. The 7 days also increases the amount that the landlord is out of pocket when they finally get a judgement in QCAT."
"Being able to put up photos/ pictures with out getting into trouble. 

Being able to have pets."
No higher rent prices for allowing pets
Remove 3rd party rent collectors that charge additional fees above the actual rent amount
"Use previous renting history to reduce or eliminate the required bond payment - ie if you have been a good tenant in the past, the bond becomes unnecessary."
Making it easier for renters to install solar hot water systems and solar panels
Allow pets & lower rental prices.
improved vetting of tenents
Ensuring agents respond to requests for information in timely manner.  
"Regulations that educate tenants that the owners have hundreded of thousands of dollars invested in the property and the tenants only one weeks rent, a couple of hundred dollars"
Not having to stress about trying to find a home that will accommodate my pets 
Clear and concise information about specific requirements expected from the tenants ie: utilities who pays what.
The Sunshine Coast is becoming extremely expensive to rent in.
The way realestates try to claim more repairs or cleaning then was done when you moved in just to get your bond back.
Faster repairs by landlords 
"Tenants shou,d have responsibility for maintaining the grounds of their rental property."
"A bigger bond, easier removal of tenants and cut red tape delays. "
"In Gold Coast found very hard to find a place, huge demand for rentals and pricing is extreme in areas. Add pets and it’s harder but that is understandable. Biggest issue was with the real estates rental departments, just often lack of communication and particularly when moving out getting account ledgers is incredibly confusing they intentionally make it hard to understand and there is no reason for it except to rip people off"
"Rules around what the owners should not be able to show biase against potential tenants. e.g I am am a carer for my grandchildren and it took me 15 applications to given a chance for a rental property. the stigma of a single parent with children, I am financial and I was not on TICA."
Only have inspections every 6mths. 
"1) All Estate Agents should have Police clearance as they want to come into unattended properties for inspections. There are also sometimes children present.
2) Photo's should only be taken of actual damages. There is no need for photo's to be taken see what the property looks like. No damage., no photo
3)Inspection times should be mutually agreed. A timetable with time slots which can be mutually agreed on and booked could be an idea. Estate Agents should not be allowed to give notice of inspection and come into property by themselves, unless mutually agreed.
4) Estate Agents attitude towards Renters should change overall. A lot of Agents are very arrogant towards Renters almost as if Renters are scum. They must remember Renters are one of their main incomes.
5)  Guidelines regarding timelines for  Maintenance repair requests need to be addressed. I've been waiting for weeks for some repairs to be done. This is very poor service and I have no recourse. I should be able to get repairs done, after waiting a certain amount of waiting time and deduct costs from rent money.
6) The ""Fair Wear"" clause needs to be more specific as it seems to be a loophole for Estate Agents to not refund deposits.

"
Maintain property in condition you moved. Ie fix appliances not disconnect!!
"I’ve always been in a position to apply for houses on my own. Sometimes the only thing real estate agents have a problem with is me having a dog, but I usually only apply for houses that are pet friendly."
Property maintenance. Should be done in a timely manner and owners should have to fix things that impact the movement in the property. 
Communication with property managers
The Agents coudl be more proactive in ensuring payments are made and reparis are actioned.
I have a small dog- under 5kg And even the places that said small pets on application denied us rent. We end up having to pay more rent just to get a place with a dog. Allowing pets would make it a lot easier for families and anyone renting to find a place.
Better accountability for property managers
Tenants be allowed to have pets 
"Property Managers need to know the laws and how to apply them correctly.  I have had negative experiences at the hands of unprofessional, inexperienced or poorly trained  managers.  I have won the battle at the end of the day, however, they were battles that I should not have had to fight.  It was only down to the ppty mgr not knowing their job and trying to force me to do something that was not required."
"When you get accepted to a house the bond has to be paid within 1 week, when you leave, even with no dispute it can take up to 2 months to get your bond back when it is at the most expensive time to move and you have to pay the rent at both houses.

Having people coming through your home inspecting it every 4 months is so incredibly intrusive and a constant reminder this is not your home its someone elses house. 

definitely renters should not be discriminated against for having a dog - they are not second class citizens "
"Less frequent inspections, and the real estate not being picky about unmade beds etc. "
"Finding a better Real estate.
Not one that promises everything at the start and then fails to answer emails and will not talk to you on the phone.
One that has the ability to get minor jobs completed within a timely period. "
Routine inspections changed from every 3 months to 6 monthly for good rental history.  
More information about the property eg connections without having to ask the question 
too high cost of average rentals
Consequences for agency's that do not comply.  For example blacklisting agents. Allow pets!!! 
Return of rental bonds. It appears to favor the land lords.
Make tenants more accountable for damage to property and non payment of rent
"Not my current landlord, but a prior one and their real estate. The owner never wanted to fix things or make improvements, even when I was willing to take half the cost, communication with the owner was very lax and difficult. At one point during that tenancy I was being harassed by the then property manager (I am a disabled pensioner) and threatened with eviction even though my tenant history was perfect with no arrears. The rent was exorbitant in relation to the surrounding similar properties. In the end I had to break my lease as my partner and I needed to move for his work and luckily we had a good property manager (not the one referred to prior) who helped us fight the owner regarding breaking the lease, partly because the owner would not contact the real estate. People with pets (within reason) should be given more opportunity with leases, trying to find somewhere you can have your pets is very difficult and because of this many people are either getting their animals euthanised or surrendering their pets, breaking the owners hearts, which causes more animals needing to be rehomed in shelters through out the state, a lot of the time there is no happy ending in these cases. I spent a lot of time living on my own with my son and two cats, I'm a disabled pensioner, a responsible tenant and pet owner, once my son moved out my cats where all I had and they largely contribute to my well being and overall health. Luckily I currently have an awesome landlord and real estate who think that I am amazing in the care that I take of the property. "
A total ban on inspections. These things make me feel like a second or third class citizen. Breach of privacy and the sanctuary of my home. I do not like paying 500 a week and then have someone doing an inspection and being expected to cope of with complaints to meet their KPI
Letting more tenants have pets on properties that are safe to do so. Even if they're required to pay a pet bond. 
Greater accountability for landlords
Repairs needed on houses need to be fixed. There is nothing forcing owners to maintain their houses. Yes I can issue a remedy breach form. This usually ends in my lease being scrapped. That’s not fixing the problem. Now I have to find another place and move. Also the next tenant gets to put up with the house’s issues. 
"More rental properties available to locals, especially those on pensions & being allowed to have my senior dog with me. "
"One thing the Govt should change is set up a free data base like TICA as the law as it stands give most to all protection to the Tenant. 
"
Landlord bound to bring home to liveable standard 
My renting experience has been fine but I know of others who have had terrible experiences.  A tenant should not be able to apply for another property without a reference from the property manager who handled the tenants last/existing property.
The competence and skills of property managers. It's all driven by money but when you deal with people's homes its all about respect and relationship. 
"The process of applying for a rental property and the criteria used to evaluate your suitability.  Many older people dont fit the 1/3 rule for income assessment, it should have more value put on your rental history.  Many couples are not considered as income is too low and presumed a risk.  We rented 1 house for 14 years then it was sold and we had to rent another.  We have a faultless record but were not considered.  Only got a place if we put our son on the lease even though he soent live there just to satisfy the 1/3 rule and even then had to settle for an unsuitable property just to have a rook over our head."
I think considering the tax benefits and also the way the rental market is at present renters should not pay for things like water.
More options to rent with pets
The attitude of the real estate agents administrating renting who think they are god and they can do what ever they like contrary to the law. 
"Pets only owners consent.
Pet bond.
Regular inspections.
Notice period both sides."
"More transparency with realtors.  I recently left a property and was told there was an outstanding amount.  Went in to hand keys and pay and was told there was no outstanding amount.  Then I was told that there was damage to the property and I know there wasnt.  The property manager would not provide proof of damage despite numerous requests.  The total of the damage and gardening (had a professional cleaner who said there was no damage - lawn maintenance by professional landscaper) was the amount of the supposdely owed monies.  They refused to refund bond and stated that they didnt have our account details.  They threatened to leave negative feedback and as my son was on the lease he was scared that this would affect his future rental prospects.  Once I paid the money for the supposed damage that they refused to show proof, the full bond went into our accounts without me having to let them know of my account details.  They were rude and threatening and I did not appreciate their treatment.  I am a registered nurse/midwife/clinical educator and I was treated with no respect."
Better education for real estate agents on renting laws. 
Std code of conduct for rental property managing agents-owners
Agents inflexible negative attitudes
"There should be proper consultation between tenants and proper administrators of rental property , there should be more than just an email"
Having the security of not having to move after end of term
"The invasive 3 monthly inspections, "
Rental affordability. The cost of housing is awful.
More rights for tenants to stay in properties on renewal of lease. Tenant feedback on inspection reports.
The ability to be able to make small changes to the property e.g. hang artworks. 
Hold landlords accountable for repairs and dangerous hazards in the property.
Researching the history and the rating of the owner of the property first before deciding to move into a particular place. 
"That prices dont keep going up every year as it it does we, like many others will have to maybe go into a very small country town that is far from anything or we will be homeless like thousands of others."
Giving young first renters the opportunity to prove they will be great tenants. I was 18 when I moved out of home and my partner and I were knocked back countless times because we had insufficient renting history. We've been in our current place for more then 6 years and make better tenants then some. 
Get off the highway.Move to a quieter house.
"Not having the house put up for sale during tenancy
"
More bond should be held by landlord/property manager to secure their asset 
Nothing I'm happy with my experience 
"Longer time to complete the condition report, problem are sometimes not noticeable until after after living in the property for up to a week or so. Treat prospective tenants with a little more respect when looking for a property to rent. "
Ethics and sensitivity training for Real estate agents.
More properties that are pet friendly
"One thing - The inspection experience for the tenant sucks.
* Stop real estate agents from visiting unannounced (they have the keys).
* Stop real estate agents visiting on short notice (The excuse can always be property valuation).
* Stop real estate agents from taking pictures during inspections.
* Real estate agents should schedule a time that works for both tenants and agents, and shouldn't be a long window.
* Inspections should be conducted no more frequently than 6 months.
* The right of inspection should be forfeited for 6 months if the real estate agent doesn't show up."
"Entry and exit reports. I live in FEAR of being ""blacklisted"" as I am a bankrupt, single mother of three and if an exit report says I have damaged things, I fear I won't ever be able to rent and will end up homeless. The current house im living in, the Entry report done by the real estate agent was shocking. She missed SO many issues. For example she said that there no comments about the wall in the lounge. When there was clearly 3 half assed patch jobs and several severe marks due to either previous tenants or dodgy building. cracks in tiles were missed, stains on carpet, mailbox is dinted badly and hole in electricity box all missed, power points were ""supposed"" to be there according to them, when there were none. Its half assed and the photos they took were like they were taken on a using a phone from last decade. "
Improved process for tenant debt recovery
The competency of the rental agents managing the properties. Need better training or further government guidance and input to regulate.
More pet friendly apartments 
Pet friendly accomodation 
More rights as being the Owner of the property.
"The way contracts are structured. We moved in on the 4 November 2004. Our lease now expires on the 5th June yearly. But we have to confirm if we are staying or moving in April which is when we are required to sign our lease for 12 months. If we don't sign in April and decide to move there is 2 months where if we move, we have to pay rent for the property or have someone take over our lease until it Expires in June. We have to pay rent on 2 properties."
Consider the location with living near an industrial area
"allow pets, quicker resolution of issues like water leaks... ability to communicate with landlord directly instead of real estate.
real estate issued warning for not paying rent. I had to get external company to go through my bank account to proof that I was actually 6 weeks ahead. real estate refused to look at their accounts till I said I will call the police as I think their is something dodgy going on"
Make the paperwork easier and all electronic.
Pets allowed at more properties
A shift to a lessee benefiting model vs the current lessor/agent bias.
"Minimum standards for energy (and water) efficiency to help with reduced living costs and more sustainable living. 
"
Definitely would take more time on entry reports.
"instead of a Bond have an insurance policy, tenants can do far more damage to a property that bond covers"
The way that agencies can add you to the ‘black list’ without notifying you 
We are landlords and have only had bad experiences in the 6 years that we have rented our property. This is due to constant rent default and damage. we had to redo our whole house which was so stressful as it hadn't long been renovated. These people just took off and are now renting elsewhere and we are out of pocket as insurance will only cover so much. Very disappointing these people are allowed to continue to get away with this. 
More respect for decisions by owners from tenants
Have more two bedroom properties for rent especially for over 50 year olds
Attitude from rental  agents.
"Increased legislation around urgent repairs.  I waited 5 days to get the stove fixed (stopped working Sunday arvo so I rang it in on Monday morning) and it was only fixed late Friday after I told the property manager I knew my rights.  Said if it wasn't fixed today, I would get it fixed on the weekend and charge them."
Management need to be a little more polite and stop playing god with people's lives
"As landlords /owners we need MORE control over our investment with regard to what the tenants are allowed to do or not to do, and we need MORE control over the size of the bond, and the duration of notices given."
Less frequent house inspections if first 2 three monthly ones have been fine
Quicker action around maintenance requests or rent deduction requirement.
More responsibility on tenants paying rent.
Have tennent pay for water as same as electricty
"More power for tenants to complain without fear of payback. For example, when landlords decline to move on an issue, there is a lot of reluctance to complain and take the matter further for fear of reprisal come time for lease renewal - either through increased rent, or terminated lease. Additionally, complaints about living conditions can sometimes take a long time to be sorted, and communication with the landlord is totally dependent on the relationship with the real estate agent. We are long term tenants, and have had a number of real estate agents due to staff change overs at the local ray white office. It would be much better if we were able to communicate directly with the landlord. "
Allow owners more rights to evict tenants who don't pay rent.  
RTA consultants need more training when giving advise to clients
New keys for each new tenant
I would like to be allowed a pet without being disadvantaged. I would like the right to hang pictures and would like less inspections for a long term tenancy with a good record.
"Enforce landlord and realtor obligations to keep their property in top condition, eg having it cleaned before renters move it, ensuring all appliances work to their best ability, taps and faucets don't leak, plumbing is safely affixed and noise is minimised, and external stairs and railings are firmly affixed and safe."
This is the first time I have rented at age 48
"The term 'reasonable' and 'quiet enjoyment' when it comes to frequency of Sales Inspections by a Real Estate Agent selling the property on behalf of the Owner. Real Estate Agents should not be allowed to bully, intimidate and harass Tenants to gain inspections and inspection times should be a mutually agreed arrangement. Property Managers and Owners should have to pay Compensation and Reduced Rents whilst a Property is for Sale for the inconvenience and added cleaning and tidying that is expected of you. I would rather be given notice to leave and Compensated, than be treated the appalling way that we have been by the Real Estate Agent."
Standardised bond clean expectation
"the major issue i have with renting in qld at the moment is with rent cards and the ""you don't get a choice other than rent card"" due to there not being any proper legislation around ""Rent cards"" i.e. forcing you to choose between Money order / Bank Check ($10 - $15) or the rent card all as to force the renter to pay the processing fees.   "
more regular inspections and photos on the property
No pets are allowed at premises
Reduce the notice period to move tenants out to 30 days.
Have a third party manage incoming rent so neither the owner nor managing real estate are at risk - sort of like the superannuation for transient workers
Easier access database to see which tenants have defaulted before.  
Ensuring fairness for the tenant in any wear and tear or damage during the exit inspection 
Allow small pets in rental accomodation. 
"Allow pets even if it means having an extra pet bond when you move in.
Also when we moved into our current rental and it wasn’t clean and the carpets weren’t clean and the grass was overgrown from the previous tenants, I think it should’ve been done and the bill sent to the previous tenants cause I always make sure I’ve had a professional clean and carpets done prior to moving out"
Put the onus back on the owner to ensure repairs are done in a timely manner
Pets being allowed everywhere 
"Contracts don't count for anything in terms of the lessor. The lease is allowed to break contract but not the other way around, costing the lessor a lot of money. 
Separately leasing agents do not support the lessor as their money comes from the landlord "
Rental agent accountability and integrity
"Feedback form from the real estate on what improvements can be made to the property, for the owners' consideration"
"Truthful about time available for renting .
Short term or long term"
Our landlord not being able to have such interference with our rental (ie she visits the property. Most maintenance is carried out by her un trained family members- question the saftey if the apartment)
More freedom to enjoy property
"Have Rental debts and damages be able to be collected by SPURS then passed on to the landlord
.   Be able to submit alias's to the Black list register"
Allowing tenants to hang pictures on the walls.
"Better regulation of landlords/property managers.
"
Owners not being allowed to put a house on the sale market when a lease is signed.
"Allow pets, it's impossible to find a place if you have a pet. I have a cat who makes ZERO mess. All of my owners have never even known I have a pet."
"Give more control back to landlords to protect their property against tenants who become unruly.  Applicants tend to show a squeaky clean presence until locked into the lease then the parties start, the damage begins and become completely unreasonable because they know the rules protect them.  Worst situation when repairs are required and they won't let you access the property to repair.  "
"Landlord hasn't made repairs promised when we signed the initial lease.  If promised there should be a requirement for the landlord to complete these within a set timeframe.  Only able to sign a lease for a 12 month term, would much prefer the peace of mind/security from having the option to sign a lease for a longer time frame (2-5years) with agreed yearly rent increases."
rental agreement and other forms to become an online version or mobile phone app for an easy access.
"If a tenant is on Centrelink payments, being able to get rent payments through Centrelink easily, BEFORE tenants spend their money on alcohol, gambling, whatever. Being able to deduct their centrelink payments to pay their bills, before they get the cash."
"Maintenance being done when requested.
More affordable rental properties. "
"Less frequent need for tradespeople/real estate to enter the property. If multiple wroks are required, having them organised for the same day. I work full time and have a large dog so am required to be home when someone comes to the property however I am not usually consulted prior and then have to arrange time off work on short notice."
"More notice required to enter for general trades (e.g. annual pest service, smoke alarms etc).

I am a reasonable person. During my adult life, have mostly been a homeowner rather than a tenant and I am also a landlord. The property I currently rent is immaculate and the gardens are in better condition than before I moved in. 

Despite this, I am constantly disappointed at the lack of respect given to tenant rights and people entering the property. If a maintenance issue is not urgent, common courtesy should be provided and a few weeks grace period. Where the trade is not relatively to safety, this is completely reasonable. "
Complete transparency and honesty from real estate agents and landlords and consistency in thier communication and more importantly thier actions. A seperate body that  ensures property managers and owners adhere to laws and fulfil thier obligations without being able to subsequently penalise tenants in rediculous manner and negatively affect future rentals for the tenant.
"As tenant: more than 2 months notice from landlord, if contract is not being renewed.
As property owner: equitable laws balancing rights of landlord and tenant."
Make longer leases such as 5 year terms available with market average increases or decreases at yearly intervals to make the longer term viable 
Enforce no pets internal to building unless agreed to by owner
The cost for a landlord having to prove the damage done by a tenant is actually so whilst the tenant has  to do nothing even though they have signed a Tenancy Agreement/ Entry condition report  to say the premises were in good condition before the tenancy commenced!
Long term renting contract
more power for landlords to evict tenants and recover costs
"Tenants being respected more.
Tenants being allowed to treat the property more like home than just a house. "
Quality of rental properties lot of dilapidated homes on the rental market. 
"I have rented in-between selling and re-buying and found the renting experience to be good, with fair protection for tenants. The only things I find unfair to tenants is when owners don't maintain their properties and sell not long after leasing.  Note regarding 1.3 below - as a landlord myself I do have one main issue and that is timeframes - at the moment they are in tenants favour which is fine with a low vacancy rate.  However, if this changes - it will become very difficult for owners. Therefore, needs to be considered in any changes made."
Ensure the realestate agent has procedures to follow to ensure they are not able to move the goal posts when it suits them. 
"Ability to hang pictures, curtains and make a home feel like home. Also have longer tenancy periods - 3 to 5 years for certainty "
Allowed to have animals and hang up a picture or two
Better quality real estate agents who are held accountable to a higher standard of qualifications and ethics. 
I don’t think animals should live in high rise buildings.
"Cheaper rent! 
Also have properties in better conditions "
"Add more resources to QCAT as wait times are ridiculous for all parties, particularly when things are urgent to resolve and it is a long wait."
"the owner has no rights when it comes to having a property on the market. Access is denied and nothing can be done. It negatives the sale process and value achieved for
Sellers "
"Pets, longer rent contracts, using bond from one house to get another one when moving needs to be easier. "
Constant intrusion and invasion of privacy. Very different from my experiences south of the QLD border.
Easier & more efficient contact between all parties
"More freedom to have my home feel as much like a home as possible, renting can feel very clinical."
Dishwasher and be able to hang frames. 
Owner forced to do preventive maintenance and fix broken items in 48 hours. 
"Most recently, more care for landlords from the RTA."
"Property maintenance that I have always looked after and paid for. Example electrical switchboards upgraded to standard, leaking roof that never gets fixed, promised upgrades to get you to move in that never happen"
Pets allowed as long as cleanliness is maintained and damage prevented
"The ease of renting to buyers with pets (or at least certain pets). A pet bond would be reasonable, or pet references from previous rentals. If children are allowed then pets should be allowed. Not much difference."
Owners of rental properties should not be allowed to drop in unannounced or be allowed to physically watch their properties from their cars. Greater penalties need to be applied to owners who are in breach.
"The tenant's control over the property - having the rights to paint, hang pictures etc. Or to update things as required without waiting and to with good quality  (to then be billed back to the owner) - ie. when flooring needs replacing etc. "
Tenants need to have more power over real estates and owners who do the wrong things.
Longer rental contracts 
"Having NOT TO ask permission from owner for small improvements/changes of the house that are not permanent, as putting a nail to hold a picture on the wall or painting the interior in a different colour. Things like those are not permanent, and can be reverted to what the house was before at the end of the lease. I should not have to ask permission to put a picture on the wall"
"Once you have been at the same address for a year and no issues with inspection for inspections to be 6 or 12 monthly. Allowed at least one dog without having to get approval, because some say pet friendly and then exclude the applicants with pets."
More power to tenants to have critical issues fixed in a timely manner. It took 5 months for our property management / owner to fix our oven that wasn't working at all. It then took the same people 3 months to fix two air-conditioning units over a full Ipswich summer. We moved and now have excellent property management /owners (hence my satisfied response). 
Id like to see all pets allowed in rental properties. I'd also like to see the guidelines in place regarding the price of rent in relation to the state or value of the property. 
To be able to have pets in our rental house. Animals are a huge part of a family these days and I think it should be allowed.
"More confidence in real estate being ‘fair and just’ when exiting a rental (i.e bond return, exit inspections)"
Property managers be held accountable for their mismanagement. And stop trying to make tenants lose their bond
"Being allowed to put pictures up.
Paint walls"
Decreasing the price of rent
"I am on a Careers Pension, I look after my mum who has advanced dementia, she receives a age care pension.
I have struggled financially and mentally for the past 5 and a half years due to high rent prices, and I have been on the waiting list for public housing for many many years listed as high level need for myself and my mother and as yet the department has not helped us, I have been lookin after my mum for 15 years now and her safe care requirements for housing, example, fully high fenced property so she can’t wander, en-suite so she can find the toilet easier, preventing access to the kitchen stove, etc, I pay $380 per week for rent and it is extremely difficult to have any quality of life "
Higher standards for property management. 
Houses are expected to be returned cleaner than they are rented. Landlords like Ray White charge tenants extra cleaning fees always on exiting properties and only photos and the tenancy tribunal can see full bond monies returned. Often tenants cant wait for tribunal decisions and take less bond back just to have living money after a move. It's a rort AND I have moved 26 times in 20 years always because the owner  sells. Tenants should be told if rentals are long term or short term but agents refuse to disclose information.
Owners being less strict on things like hanging up photos and also allowing pets. 
"Owners should cover cost of returning property to original condition when tenants are given notice to leave when no breach by tenant has been made, even if lease is ending. This would help ease the stress of the instability in these circumstances and reduce the use of evictions without reason to punish tenants for upholding their rights. "
"(1) more rights for tenants
(2) penalties for shady landlords
(3) allow pets if reasonable
(4) make longer term rental agreements the standard
(5) protect tenants if they have a complaint against a landlord"
Constant denial of pets
When things needed to be fix they get done straight away and not the cheapest option. 
Make all real estate agents use a standard form with a standard 100 points system.
"More rental assistance from federal government
Long-term leases 
Not being able to rent a property on your own because of the cost. 
More affordable housing "
More autonomy as a proven good renter
For the owner and estate agent to view the property before leasing and start of leasing with the tenant 
Get a PO box to reduce the change of address issue
Ability to contact or meet the owner rather than always going throught the agent
"Price of rent should be governed better.
Or be more transparent "
"get the real estate to do repairs, at the moment nothing is getting repaird"
It needs to be more straight forward when tenants are refusing to pay their rent and are damaging property
Having to allow your own choice of pets as long as they are well looked after an what every they break you fix
"A better balance between tenants rights and those of the landlord, especially regarding length of tenancies in the last 10 years the longest agreement I have had has been 12 months.  At my age 62+ years and being where I have been for the last three years trying to plan for retirement and addressing long term health concerns (which medical experts to choose, records of treatment etc) is problematic when you only have 1 years tenure.  The stress of having to move gets more with each passing year as you just don't have the physical capacity to do it. I have had to move twice in the last 4 years, once for work and the second time because my landlord wanted to change the use of his property and evicted 25 units of residents to do so, 3 months notice to relocate. Of course affordability is always a biggy especially as I face retirement."
"Pet friendly-ness, more places should allow pets"
Being able to have more input into house making it a home ie pictures on walls improving  the look and stability. 
Being treated like a responsible adult not like a pubescent teenager
Being in a house that the owner cares to maintain 
More efficient responses from property manager in regards to repairs
Real Estate agents being proactive in reporting tenants who are treating the property poorly.
"More control, more freeedom. I.e. gardening how I like, keeping pets etc"
Having maintenance issues dealt with in a reasonable time frame.
Not to give moving out when your not ready to move out atleast the landlord should give tenant minimum  5 years  tenancy
"Inspection frequency has been changed to quarterly, had a tenant trash my rental.
1 out of 5 tenant I have had rent my property since 2010."
"Stop owners increasing the rent per week when renewing a lease. 
Prevent inspections when the tenants are not home. "
Being able to get tenants out sooner when they don’t pay rent or damage the property
"1. That landlords comply/ be held accountable for what existing laws governing rental agreements/tenants 

2. That human rights laws be introduced to the existing laws on renting"
"I would like to see less frequent inspections. As a renter of more than five years (I have not yet decided where I would permanently like to live) my inspections have always been perfect. For tenants that say for the first six months, can demonstrate they are neat, clean, tidy and capable of looking after a home, I think it would be a good idea to reduce their rental inspections to twice annually. It feels like a kick in the guts, and that you can't be trusted when you have to have your ""home"" inspected every three months. "
Timeframes when dealing with disrespectful tenants
"Enable tenants to exercise their rights to have their pets live with them in their home otherwise we are contributing to the trauma and high numbers of animal euthanasia at RSPCA and kennels

To enable tenants to put art and family images on the walls of their properties - tenants need an outline of how to safely put a picture on a wall 

Enforcing owners to ensure that the property is both safe and well maintained by responding expediently to maintenance requests"
"1.  Extend period of notice in the instance where the owner wants to take back occupancy.  60 Days notice is insufficient.  This should be increased to 3 months so that tenants have sufficient time to look for new accommodation.
2.  Owners forced to comply with mandated turnaround time for repairs."
The bond return system. We’ve had our bond held for 3 months while waiting for an owner to make a decision
I'm a landlord & am happy with how everything is working at present.
Rents are high but landlords are reluctant to fix things and if they do they increase the rent
Quick court process to relet property
"Notice periods are in tenants favour. 
Needs to be balanced for both tenants and property owners. "
"I am both a tenant of a rental property, the mother of a person with a disability who is renting privately and waiting since 2010 for public/social housing, and a landlord of a rental property. I believe that the tenancy laws do not adequately protect landlords from terrible tenants, nor do they protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords.  As a landlord of a Bay Island property that is a very nice house - I have not been able to ever obtain the rental that the house should attract and finding good tenants is difficult even for the property manager.  
The Dept. of Housing and Public Works could have a register of current and eligible social / public housing tenants operate similar to Flatmates.com where those who are eligible for public/social housing can choose their preferred co-tenants.  Those who are eligible and privately renting should have their rental subsidised so that they only pay what they would in social/public housing.  (the National Rent Assistance Scheme is available but is not sufficient for those who are eligible for public housing but have not been found an adequate property). 
For landlords who have problem tenants, there must be a means to evict them without resorting to extreme measures.  While there is a move to allow tenants to have pets in their homes, my daughter had a co-tenant at her house and her two indoor house cats wrecked her furniture and yet as a sub-let housemate, she has no recourse to have this matter redressed.  I think that pets should be allowed in private rental properties but this should still be at the discretion of the owner depending on the type of pet and the access areas of the house.  It is not reasonable to expect that home owners should be subjected to mandated pet tenancies especially when some tenants may have more pets than what they declare and do not abide by the agreed rules of pet access to carpeted areas.

"
2 months notice to terminate contract is too long.  
Have better axcess to rental hestory for private landlords.
The quality and training and attitude of the Property Management teams as well as their efficiency.
Make it more affordable to live with instead making it hard for the low income earners
"Pets should be allowed in rental properties. It is ludicrous how this form of discrimination is still occurring in 2018. If a family with two children is refused a rental property due to having children, which are capable of causing far more damage than majority of pets, it is unlawful. However, if a pet owner is refused a rental due to having a tiny Chihuahua it is lawful. "
Allow pets and minor modifications such as picture hooks 
"Pets allowed, less inspections for tenants in place over a year (with a good inspection history)"
"The way rental agents treat you, the tone in which they speak and communicate with you."
To be able to make alterations to the place that will benifit both parties
Switch to annual inspections for tenants who have been in the home for a year and have passed all the 3-monthly inspections. 
That you can make it more like a home put up pictures (I would fix up the holes) maybe have a dog as long as you leave the property as you found it 
"My main issue is the current Qld regulations relating to Tenants having Pets in rental properties - houses or units, as together with any Body Corporate laws and the Body corporate ability to prevent pets ownership when renting. Very discriminatory when prospective tenants only have 10% source within the property rental market when around 65% have pets. Many mature age people are downsizing and a large percentage have pets and struggle to find good accommodation if they are a pet owner.
Simple things like the capacity to hang a picture or secure a television to a wall to ensure kids safety or have someone stay with you temporarily without seeking landlord permission.  "
"Rental properties should all be pet friendly, but should have to declare they have a pet and must increase the quality of the bond cleaning at the end of the tenancy."
The power of tenants to have pets inside a rental property without the consent of the rental property owner
Realestate doing their job more effectively 
"Pets should be allowed for responsible tenants.
Special Conditions as an annexe to lease agreements are out of control and can be discriminatory."
"Some real estate agents make renters feel like second class citizens and are rude and difficult to deal with. 
Repair and maintenance issues are not always dealt with in a timely fashion.
Routine inspections can be quite traumatic and invasive.

I currently rent through Buranda Housing and have none of the issues noted above - they were my previous rental experiences.
"
Getting minor repairs done more promptly. The agent should be able to get minor things done without having to contact the owners/landlord.
To be able to treat the house as if it were my own eg be able put pictures on the walls and be able to put up curtain rails and drapes
"Greater affordability. Places are getting ridiculous in price for the average tenant, and rent increases are beyond the wage increase rate. "
"This survey appears geared to renters rather than landlords. Anyway, we have property managers and we have good tenants. As they take care of our property, we take care of them. Eg. Installing brand new air conditioning within 3 days."
The ability to have pets- to make it more viable for tenants to have pets 
Have Renters Rights and a body to stand up for us
"Open houses/open for inspections/private viewings when renting a property that is listed for sale. Perhaps, when there are more than a certain number of Open Houses scheduled, rent should automatically be reduced per week for tenants. I'm not sure that property owners and real estate agents understand the extra effort involved for renters when a property is listed for sale - the extra time spent cleaning, moving personal items to ensure the property is ""sale ready"" (""sale presentable""), making sure that valuables are hidden away. The renter is hugely exposed when their rental property is up for sale - every nook and cranny is viewed by potential buyers; the wardrobes and drawers, laundries and bathrooms, nothing seems to be private."
Ability to have pets no matter what. More bargaining power when it comes to lease renewal. No discrimination for having children.
More time to complete the entry report.
"Below refers to when the owner is sell their property with tenant in possession and with a current  lease on the property. I am not referring to, if the lease has run out and the tenant is on a periodic lease.
Restrict open homes to 1 per week, weekend inspections restricted to 1 per fortnight, when the owner is selling while property is still under contract lease.

Compensation paid to tenants per inspection/open home when selling with a valid lease.
Compensating for...
Inconvenience.
Restricted use of the space which has been paid for.
Exposer to damage/thief of possessions property.
Loss of privacy, eg Photos being taken without permission, draws being opened.
Tenants should be given a right of refusal for a buyer to enter property, if their is a personal, safety concern/ history between them that that person may cause damage to possessions property or person.
Real estates to be held liable for compensation for damage/ theft of tenants property during open homes.

Stop real estates using photos of tenants property to advertise the owners property.

Restricting real estates and landlords during general inspections, to only taking photos of damage to their property, excluding taking identifying photos of tenants, their children and their possessions.

Not to take identifying photos like rego numbers/faces, at the property and then list on a website or a public place.

Landlords to take photos of their property for promotion when empty. 
Or a cash payment of the equivalent to staging costs paid to tenants, if tenant agrees.

I am a tenant and landlord.
Renting on and off for 28 years.


"
"1)pets allowed more often
2) more rentals in the Fraser Coast area. We're in a rental crisis, no rentals
3) rogue real estate agents be given harsher penalties. "
Make sure that real estates can't add fees to rent payments
When moving out of rental accommodation the standard of cleanliness required by real estates is variable and it depends on the attitude and personality of the agent and consequently how pedantic they can be
Tighter SLAs for rental agents to respond to tenants enquiries. I have found myself on some occasions chasing up responses multiple times.  The main challenge being service is inconsistent. 
Rentees and lessors sharing the cost of air conditioner and carpet cleaning costs. Allowing pets in more homes. More nras and housing commision homes.
"What has annoyed me the most is that the owners will often increase the rent when your lease is due for renewal to cover the rental repairs done on the property more than market even though the market has moved as much as the increase. I am also an owner for many years and my rental increase (if any) is always reasonable. It is a hard one because obviously it depends on the market. If you can easily replace the tenant then that’s what would happen if the tenant didn't agree to the increase, but there needs to be some middle ground I think. Perhaps an increase of more than $10 per week needs more evidence of market movement."
Tenants must abide by QCAT rulings
Less aggressive landlords re payment when paid on time on my end and they did not get it on time their end. Checks on rogue landlords who re-rent out same property and ignore paperwork so I had to get partial refund on my bond. Repairs are done in timely manner on insultation in roof and damaged power supply in backyard when contractors are incompetent on Dept of Housing unit I live in instead of ignoring problem and giving run around. HPW is very tough on tenants.
Make sure all agents/agencies are members of REIQ so that when they breach terms (eg. entering property without giving notice) REIQ are able to do something about it.
"Have the details of the property included in the lease.
Ie: number of bedrooms and whether it includes a garage etc"
"As a previous (retired) Real Estate Principal/Property Manager and property owner renting out my own properties, I now find that being a ""real"" tenant is very different. 
I would like very much to have an agent who is a ""person"" instead of a ""machine"" under the control of a company system that does not allow any changes!!"
Greater ability to access the tribunal to recover funds over and above the bond for tenant's damage
"Reduce  number of inspections
"
Better communication and management by agent
Less frequent renr raises when economy is not rising. 
More liberty to make fixable changes
More flexibility with viewing times. Open houses are a nightmare as we always have to take time off work to go view an open house with another 20 people. one is herded through the house like cattle and if you can't make the open house then bad luck because no one cares and enough takers for the property.
The attitude of both the property manager and the home owner towards the tenant.
"To have more transparency between the owner and tenant.
I feel that the agents tend to complicate matters."
Property Manager is extremely rude
"Allow negotiation between owner and tenant re pets and smoking.
Possibly an extra cleaning or repair bond.
When a property is damaged beyond the value of the bond, The tenant can do more costly damage while repair negotiations are negotiated."
nothing - I am completely satisfied
"From a property owner's perspective, tenants view a property and sign a lease for the property as it is and should not have free reign to make modifications as they see fit i.e. add additional wall hooks, plumb dishwashers through existing/new cabinets. "
Renter to respect the property they are renting
I think ceiling fans should be ssomething that all ll should have in property's
"Real estates being held to their obligations. Responding to repair requests, safety issues, being fair when it comes to exit reports and bond returns, etc"
"The ability to communicate with landlords effectively. Have clearer guidelines and procedures for things to get done faster and more efficiently. This includes anything from home repairs, renewing leases and taking rental payments. The entire system needs to be streamlined. "
"Give the landlord more control over tenants - undercover, covert actions with pets and changes to the rental  property's fittings such as smoke detectors, and burning of aromatic candles etc in the premises. 
Tenants should be up front about their pets and not sneak them off the property during inspections.
I think a pet bond should be considered along with a personal bond.  The pet bond has to be able to cover damaged curtains, scratched wall/fittings and damaged carpets and floor coverings and in some instances replacment.  Scratches to polished floor and vinyl flooring need to covered. The bond should be such that it covers a forensic cleaning of carpets, floor coverings, floors,  curtains, under house and yard areas etc etc. .  I had an experience where a flea plague stared about 18 days after a tenant vacated the premises and had an undeclared pet dog.  Difficult to rent a flea trap.  I tore up the carpets in al effort to cleanse the property. Had to redo the pest control at the premises, under house and yard area.  
One tenant disconnect the smoke alarms so that aromatic candles and other burning devices were used through out the house.  The agent said the tenants were annoyed by the smoke alarms going off.   An  undeclared cat was also on the premises and shredded curtains.
One tenant has permission for 2 persons in the contract, upon inspection I found 6 extra persons living there for the long term.  The agent knew nothing about this gross overloading of the premises.

Agents are money, sorry, profit driven, and the 6 monthly rotation of good tenants for get a bond payment stinks.  They pay the shopfront rental with tenant turnover.

One agent told a tenant that if he complained about a loose step tread, the rent would increase.  I inspected the property and happily repaired the tread an did not increase the rent.
Agents do need to be kept on a tighter leash when they need extra cash flow for what ever reason, usually expansion, self gratification.
The trend for centralized real estate groups looking after a larger geographic area causes problems with property management.  Staff turnover sees to be high, so no real focus is placed on the landlords property.  Regrettably the staff/residence ratio is such that effective inspections are not the norm.  Generally neighbours or personal inspection is the only way to see the social impact on a residential area.
"
6 or 12 month contracts are unflexible for tenants. They should run indefinite if mutually agreed and tenants should have a right to stay when the house is sold.
More flexibility to make changes and personal touches.
Freedom to have pets and hang stuff on the walls
Make the bond 8 weeks rent and have an additional pet bond
More flexibility in breaking lease in certain situations
Being able to find a rental easily that will accept indoor pets
"make it easier to rent with pets > prevent real estates from asking about pets, may even stop so many pets being disowned"
"Get a better property manager, one who actions requests, gets back to you, doesn't need constant reminding to follow up the landlord on decisions. They are a bottleneck and add very little value, and there is no way or changing the property manager when you are the renter."
Some pets cause damage to inside and out side of properties and should be the decision of property owner. 
"I don't  like how many landlords won't  let you hang pictures on walls. I think letting people put a few hooks up, as long as they are properly done, should be allowed. I have not a single picture hook or anything to hang any sort of decoration. I also think there should be penalties for landlords that turn up whenever it suits them."
Consistant procedures and minimum standards across Queensland for Property Managers
"The suspicious culture between renters, property owners, and real estate agents. As a renter, there is always a concern of being blacklisted or evicted (and no corresponding reward for being a reliable tenant year). Is there a way to match long term tenants (who want to treat a place like their own home) and long term landlords (who are happy to have someone live in their home) and sign longer leases with more flexible conditions (i.e. more like Europe) to reduce the stress for both parties?"
Just recently started our journey in investment property in Queensland - I might have more inputs over time
Having option for longer lease agreements
Allow landlords to quickly remove tenants that aren't paying rent
"I would like having one person to deal with in an agency, not so many new people all the time. Also having more houses that allow pets, as it can be hard to find a house allowing pets. Less inspections after one year of renting should also be considered if the tenants are taking care of the house."
Balance of equity between Tenant and Landlord
Easier for older people to find housing
Landlords took forever to conduct repairs and agents treated me like a second rate citizen 
"Insist on seeing references, photos of where they currently rent, and be firm about 3 monthly inspections.  Be firm about all damage & repairs being paid for by tenant."
All tenants should be held accountable for restitution of damages / outstanding rent regardless of their perceived capacity to pay ie. those on Government Benefits
"House inspections that do not require me to take time off work, realestate are not flexible with the time and say you don't have to be there. No owner would let strangers have access to their home why do renters have to. I have had my door left unlocked on one occasion. The cost to the economy with people taking sick leave to accomodate this is potentially huge. RTA states that agents should arrange with the tenant but in my experience this doesn't happen."
More affordable rentals for big families.
Allow tenents to have dogs.
"Ability to treat the home as my own, for example, having a dog live inside with us, putting in temporary fixtures like pictures and paintings"
Changes to the rules about entering the property by agent or third party 
"Fairness to a tenant who ALWAYS pays on time and keeps the house as their home in good, clean condition. "
Better protections for renters rights.
More affordable rental accomodation 
Being more selective in the rental process-asking more questions of agents etc before renting
None - as I manage my rental property personally.
more notice of the sale of a property
Pets should be approved in all rentals. 
"If the tenants do damage to the property or overuse water and electricity, it is very hard to do anything about it.  If they don’t pay or don’t fix it there is no real way to execute on the compliance.  "
Property managers not being so overworked they don’t have time to reply or act in a timely manner
Stopping the owner selling the property while you are on a lease 
Allowing pets in all rentals 
longer rental lease period
Ability to have pets. Choice of longer leases signing lease for 2-5 years. Prompt action on repairs.
Not renting with lying property managers 
Clarity on tenant and owner responsibility with regard maintenance
Owners need to fix when things need fixing 
House renting has to be regulated by the state. Increase or decrease in rent has to follow certain reasonable guidelines thru regulation.
"Dealing with body corporate rules in apartments, specifically pet rules"
Greater responsibility of tenants to maintain the property.
Fairness for property owner
Need to cater more to low income renters.  
Cost/availability of renting
Turnaround times for repairs are too long sometimes.  Smoke alarm batteries are not changed regularly or without prompting.  Would like to be able to hang pictures and change curtains without needing permission.
"Make it easier to get problems fixed, make the agents/landlord more accountable for passing on information to the appropriate people. "
Option to break lease without penalty when there are issues with neighbours
"To be treated like a normal person, no lower class for choosing to rent.  "
Real estate Agencies treating prospective tenants and tenants like second-class citizens.
"Pets always being allowed, being able to put up picture hooks "
Better building insulation/climate management standards.
Entry times would be negotiated to a time that suits me as the tenant.
"Pets should be allowed in all properties.

Given that most people have pets it seems crazy that there is currently a BIG issue for people with pets to rent a unit. Its virtually impossible due to body corporate laws which is highly unfair. It is also difficult for people wanting to rent a house - a change of attitude from home owners/real estates is needed. It should be expected that people will have pets. Most people would be happy to pay a pet bond in order to rent a house or unit and keep their fur babies with them"
"When your tenant trashes your property, that they should be placed on a register, so as they cannot do the same thing to others."
"The cost. Renting in most towns has become unaffordable for single income, or sole parents "
Greater access to homes that allow pets.
Have a bit more freedom of how you live in the house eg: commando hooks are ok to use as they remove easily. Making the house you rent a home to live in. Allowing your pet dog inside the house as children/adults make more mess and damage then animals! This could be a thing if Renters could show proof of living correctly and without any damage to the property for the 1st 6 months. This can be shown what inspections are done quarterly.
Locked in rental amount. Linked to condition of property. 
Allow pets and more regulation on owners and real estates
Better communication with Property Managers
"There is a lot of construction work occurring in the Brisbane area, I think that there should be either wider consultation with those living around about work hours (Saturday 6:30am until 6:30pm means it is near impossible to stay home), and also consideration given to cleaning exteriors etc. as this additional mess and the inconvenience results in more costs for the tenants. "
The owner vs body corporate relationship. They're never on the same page. 
More organised real estate
"Rental company notifying when a change  occurs with manager of property, so I can contact relevant staff member. 
Receiving lease renewals before they expire. "
Allow pets in all rentals
I think that if you have a good record and have been living in the premises for over 2 years the inspections could be completed 6monthly instead of 3 monthly as a trial basis.
too early to say. Have only entered the rental market as a property owner in the last few months.
Property Managers to show respect
Real estate taking photos of your personal items. I feel it invades my privacy. Why are they checking. Can’t they just make a report and if there is damage then take photos. 
"I object to the quarterly ""inspections"" where usually a junior member of the Real Estate agency tramps through my unit taking photos.  I never let anyone in without me being here although Real Estate agents seem to think this is the done thing - just take the keys and enter the unit.  I find it highly intrusive and insulting.  I am 60 years of age and a mature and tidy tenant who always pays her rent on time.  My neighbour in our small block of 5 units (all units are occupied by mature women) was told the inspections are done to make sure the tenant is looking after the place and not putting holes in the walls.  What an insult!  They should reduce these inspections to once per year.  It is an intrusion of privacy. I can understand if the tenants are young and prone to holding wild parties but not older tenants who live a relatively quiet life."
Having pets allowed - many suitable properties are ruled out because they don't allow pets.  Pets do little damage and any damage done should be fixed by the tenant.  
Last minute notice for non urgent entry 
"More freedom withing the house I'm renting, like being allowed to change certain things."
I think the current rules are fair.
stop landlords from discriminating against animals
"Better property managers. Someone who is more interested in ensuring the landlord is not being ripped off, than trying to keep an excessive, damaging tenant quiet. "
"Better privacy protections. I was put in danger when a real estate agent told the neighbour who was harassing me that I made a complaint (I and a female uni student and would often be home late from class and this neighbour would be leud and make comments on what I was wearing and would ask when my partner would be home). 
Ventilation and air quality should probably be a consideration for regulation, it's hard to fix as a renter as aircon cant be installed windows can't be made. 
Ability to have a pet. I have a cat who comes with recommendations from previous landlords and yet I can still be refused or not even considered. "
Better and fairer service provided by Property Manager's
Fewer inspections and no photographs
Better oversight on renters. Landlord need automatic coverage for rental defaults etc. 
"Be a little bit more flexible towards the tenants. I have been in my current house for 6 years and yes there are some marks on the garage wall, but I will fix them when we move out. I can only speak for myself, but I treat this as my house and it is way better off now than when I moved in 6 years ago"
"The ability to make changes to the rental, i.e. freah paint and carpets."
Improve letting agents competance to reduce time between applying for a tenancy and receiving an answer.
Property Managers to be better qualified and to complete mandatory trg and be held accountable by both tenants and landlords for good and por performance.
Better communication with renter and landlord.
"Seems tenants have too many rights and owners have limited rights. Tenants only need to give 2 weeks notice owners 2 months to vacate, too long for tenants to do damage and not pay rent. Tenants used to be somewhat responsible for some repairs but now owners do the lot, owners are getting sick and tired of having to replace little things at great cost when the tenant is using the property and wearing out the items like tap washers to use an example."
I don't like the invasion of privacy with inspections. Our realty inspects our home every 8 weeks which I think is excessive.
"assured longer term tenancy, properties that were purely for rental purposes even if sold"
Sewerage charges should not be paid by owner. It is directly related to water used and it should be passed on to tenant. More incentive to conserve water.
Rental prices should not be paying off the entire mortgage costs for the landlord. Rents have grown so high for something half decent and landlords are basicslly having the tenants pay their entire mortgage which isn't fair
Better management from the agent
Deal with a more efficient government department then QBCC when building the rental.  
Meeting owner of property.
"The notice time to tenants is to long  no minor changes are allowed and no pets 
All this should be accepted from the lad lord as the property is his or hers. 
I am selling my properties in QLD as it is getting to hard.   "
"Clarify rules around exit condition reports, increase penalties on real estates which are found to be in breach of their duties"
"Tenants with an excellent reputation should not have to submit to housing inspections every 12 weeks/3 months.  Inspections should only be carried out twice per year.  Phonographs of the tenants property are intrusive, taken illegally without the tenants, permission and breaks the privacy act. A photo should only be taken of any structural damage that may have occurred or of items that may need repair. An outside photo of the home is permissible."
That landlords can’t turn ppl away with pets if the home is suitable. ie. ground floor apartment or house
The real estate seems to think that a renter is a second class citizen and that any repairs they refuse to do are OK and the tennant should just suck it up.
"To have property managers more willing to accomodate the needs of a working tenant, whether that be for inspections, maintenance, or reviewing a house to see if it meets my needs. Property managers DEMAND you comply to their working requirements, which means that I as the money earner, can not see most of them as I am earning the money I need to pay rent, and can't visit them during business hours."
Make landlords/agent accountable for repairs and maintenance.
THE REAL ESTATES NEED TO BE  UP FRONT ABOUT THE HISTORY ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT A TENNANT IS ABOUT TO RENT . AND DO NOT LIE ABOUT THE TEANNANTS  THAT JUST LEFT JUST TO RE RENT THE PROPERTY . MY SONS EXPERIENCE THE HOUSE HE HAS JUST RENTED A MONTH AGO A YOUNG GUY HUNG HIMESELF IN THE GARAGE AND REAL ESTATE DID NOT TELL HIM HE WANTS OUT OF CONTRACT BUT THEY WILL NOT LET HIM.
"More transparency and accessibility with the advertising and contracts. I think that most people (regardless of age) don't have a good understanding of their rights and what they should expect from a property manager etc. There's a real fear of asking too many questions or making demands, in case you're not offered the place on that basis. There are also places that are advertised either disingenuously (intentionally misleading or omitting information) or with false information. "
Agents to be held accountable for how they treat tenants
Open communication with the landlord.
quality of property managers at real estate agents
More rights to remove bad tennants. 
Stop agents from jacking up the rent at greater than CPI 
Agents need to comply within the Qld Housing guidelines
Stop treating Tenants like criminals. RTA is wildly unfair to tenants.
That your bond can be transferred once approved to the next house you rent.
Make the resolution process easier
"I would like to see from a private rental perspective that owners are made to rectify maintenance issues on a property. Owners can refuse to complete maintenance yet still charge or increase weekly rent on a lease. This needs to change. 
for public housing i would like to see that the legislation changes to give more power back to the department to remove tenants who after all avenues of support and service just cannot sustain their tenancy. Changes required to be more harsher penalties for illegal activity and clandestine drug labs. "
Ensure an equitable bond return system 
Transparency on the owners future plans so the tenant can have more stability 
6 weeks bond should be required for a property
Less intrusive inspections (currently having them every 3 months) and far better property maintenance. 
A bit more clarity and communication on the rules to all parties.
More of a balance between the rights of the property owner and the tenant. At the moment it is unfairly in favour of the tenant. The Government should not legislate to allow tenants to have pets. Under no circumstance should the government tell me what i am able to do with my property. If i don't want tenants to have pets in my property then that is my decision and not the Government's decision.
"something to prevent rent being put up every year, even though the market in the area doesn't warrant it, also allow pets more easily."
Improved rights for renters
Shift the balance in residential tenancy law so that tenants can assert their rights without fear of retaliatory action being taken by landlords.
"The ability to have more control over making a rental a home. Small things lie being able to put up picture hooks, adding more shelving to cupboards, or even paint a room if it needs it. These things make a house a home, especially if you plan to rent long term."
Being allowed to have a pet approved.   I think it's very unfair that it is considered a serious breach.  There could be something in the legislation about being a responsible pet owner and some clauses included to clarify this so that people can have a pet.
The renting plateform is very unfair ranging from housing commission to private so called discount gov. Properties especially for those with long term health issues. Any company/staff members that represents the public should not treat their tenants as though we are scum & deserve nothing better. Bullying & abusive behaviour to the point you don’t want to make contact. Dirty on entry of property & spotless when I leave is so wrong. Unbalanced.
Property managers have a knowledge of the law - currently they just yell at us if we tell them the law and tell us we are wrong...
Incremental costs are making it harder to justify owning rental properties
Give Landlords more rights.
Being advised of housing commission properties in the area (have had ongoing issues with next door neighbour for over a year)
Quicker turn around times on property fixes. We've had a broken back fence for over 9 weeks now and have a dog on the premises and can't have to dog outside because we don't have a back fence. So having rules/regulations surrounding timeframes on when things need to be fixed. 
Maybe the honesty of the Real estate Industry. They dont always tell you everything you should know.
Better return on investment
"Real estate agents are way too strict on tenants, if your house doesn't look like a brand new display home that no one lives in when they come to do inspections, they complain about everything (eg. A clean oven with a couple of bread crumbs on a oven tray WE OWNED - they complained about the breadcrumbs even though the oven had been professionally cleaned only one month prior and was still spotlessly clean!) "
"More allowance for pets and their owners who are legitimately well-behaved. I'm more than happy to provide dog training certificates etc, but currently looking for somewhere new that allows pets after being in my current tenancy for 5 years without issue while having pets that whole time is proving extremely difficult."
Property managers keeping a closer eye on managed property's to ensure the landlords investment is being looked after 
Better support for tenants with pets
The inspections ever 3 months
Pets should be authorised in all rental properties.
property worth the rental price - that repairs or problems have been considered in the amount of rent or rent reduced for occurring problems
"Increased amounts for Bonds
Pet Bonds
Tenants Breaking Leases and walking free"
"More security of tenure (long leases etc) and improved capacity to personalise the experience of having a home (plants, pets, pictures)"
Ability to obtain a lease term in excess of 12 months
The low number of rental properties makes it so hard to find somewhere to live when you are only given 4 weeks notice to move out.
"My rental is MY home, I'd like to treated with respect. I should have the right to be present when someone enters , enough notice to manage this is most important"
Less inspections for good tenants 
"Culturally appropriate staff.
Larger family homes.
Cheaper rent 
"
Allowing pets in properties
"If tenants are abiding by their lease, they should have rights to treat and live in the property as their home.
If tenants are not abiding by their lease (eg. damaging property in a way they wouldn't their own home or not paying), the owner should have greater rights to remove them from the property utilising an easier option than the court. The cost and delays involved in going through the current bureaucratic process should not be borne by the owner."
I'd like to be able to own a pet + I'd like to be able to make small modifications like putting up wall shelves.
Feeling I know my rights and more control over my rental situation.
"Landlord(Real estate agent) do not respect tenants. 
"
A maintenance request should be registered with a impartial third party so that they can keep the property owner to account and ensure if request has been acted on if not unreasonable.
Strengthen tenants rights to privacy and long term tenure
Enforceable rules that allow landlords to recover damage cost that don't fall under malicious damage by law that are greater than the bond
"As a property owner, I feel we are disadvantaged now after the Act 1994 was abolished. "
Increase bond so tenants would respect contract.
Watch who the owners are - unfortunately the experience i have had with Italians and Asian owners has not been good. They are too tight and won't pay for things to get fixed.
"Tighter laws around tenants and rental payments, especially international students or visitors from overseas."
"Notice to vacate is massively in the tenants favour, periodic agreements 2 weeks vs 2 months notice seems unfair, if it is assumed a landlord is able to find another tenant in 2 weeks it should be assumed that a tenant should be able to find another rental in the same 2 week time frame. 1 months notice for either party would be fair"
Make all properties pet-friendly
"Need to protect property, as well as protecting tenants' interests."
The balance of power between renters and agents
Would make the organisation that I rent my property to easier to contact and change the rate of contact made when there is an issue.
People should be allowed pets. 
"allowed to make small changes such as put up pictures as part of normal wear and tear
make pets allowed by default. so few properties allow pets, most people I know who rent and own a pet do so in violation of the terms of their lease."
more options for evicting bad tenants
"During application process, if the property is under application already we should not be able to apply. Was such a waste of time attending inspections that were already under application. "
"The way the real estate agent handles maintenance and other enquiries. They are very one sided towards the Landlord, very intimidating and passive aggressive. Very difficult to deal with and put you down for being a tenant and not a home owner. (They have actually said that). eg. ""you would have to pay for ... if you were a home owner."""
nil fees for direct debits when paying rent
More pet friendly properties.
"Ability to hang pictures etc within reason and without it having to have picture hooks etc approved by the owners.  The need to constantly jump through hoops often has people living in houses that don't feel like homes.  Almost everything needs to be approved by owners, so you're paying high rental rates, but can't make it a home without someone's approval."
"Changing the notice tenants need to give landlords before they move. Two months is far too long to know if you've got another property to go to. It would be better to have it at least at one month like other states, so tenants aren't doubling 2 months worth of rent to move."
More availabiloty when it comes to quarterly inspections. 
more protection for landlords in terms of renters breaching contracts eg abandoning properties
"Communication Skills.  Between all parties - Real Estate Agent/onsite management (in the case of apartments etc), the owner and the tenant."
"More freedom for renters to make the house their home (with negotiation with owner).  

Clearer definitions of general wear and tear - to make bond refunds more efficient and with less grey areas. "
Rent in newer places so I don’t have to rely on the owner to fix things.
improve landlord protection against tenants breach of contract
"For new migrant (or people who have not rented before) who wants to rent, they should not be restricted to be rented only when they could provide previous rental references / tenant ledger. The landlord or property agent should consider to rent to these people when they could provide full supporting documents plus any additional rent deposit or rent in advance. Else it is not fair to deny renting to these genuine renter with good intention and background  who are new to the country or first time renting and without previous rental reference or tenant ledger.  

Secondly, the renter should also be required to pay a deposit for water consumption (when there is individual water meter installed for the rental property), this will reduce the chances that the renters are trying not to pay for their outstanding water bill owed to the landlord and also overcome the difficulty to obtain timely interim water bill from the Urban Utilities company when the renter move out.  "
Being able to make a house more a home
"Complex Manager's have a good understanding of English and all the rules regarding notifying tenants of entry to the premises and also do repairs in a timely fashion.
"
"Make rental agencies understand the duel nature of their role, they work for both sides."
"Tenants to really appreciate the importance of the property care /cleaning/ maintenance. All this is explained at entry to rental agreement with the appropriate literature from Government sources and in house management. However, there is a short term memory loss I'm sure. Have noticed a community training programme being initiated in the Ipswich area to address this. Great Idea."
"Remove the water charges. People rent so they don't have to pay for extra things like rates, water etc.
People should be allowed to have small pets in Townhouses, provided they aren't able to roam, such as inside completely and or even be allowed to temporarily enclose their courtyard so their animals cannot escape.
People should be allowed to have pets in rental houses too. Why should they miss out. It's horrible to hear how people have had to give their loved ones away or sleep in cars not to loose them."
"Better communication between tenants, realty and owners "
Closer observation to regular maintenance
"Pets should be allowed. 
More rights surrounding entry by maintenance workers."
Lower rental prices to a more reasonable standard. 
Making the landlord more responsible for carrying out basic R&M.
that the RTA have more to help resolve disputes when a tenant or agent is being unreasonable the rta should be allowed to say so to help resolve the problems  
"Make pets allowed, make the application recess simpler, allow long term leases, allow tenants to make small changes to the property such as hang a picture, give tenants the right to choose their own utility provider, currently some real estates make tenants go with their provider."
Being treated more fairly and also better communication from property managers.
"After renting the same property for 5yrs I hate the inspections every 3 mths, I feel it excessive after no incidents during our entire tenancy. After 2yrs of no issues I feel it should go to 6mthly or once a year. Renters are entitled to their privacy too and I feel it’s intrusive every 3mths and excessive."
"Ensuring lease agreements actually mean something. Tenants and Landlords need to uphold their end of the agreement. Especially if a tenant needs to break lease, then they should honour their contract until another tenant can be found so that the landlord does not suffer financial hardship. "
The negotiation service between renters and owners needs to be able to be enforced when wrongdoing is found either with renters or owners.
There needs to be a better system in place to address the issue of delinquent tenants.
Real Estate agents should not be expected to go into dirty houses and catch sicknesses and then have them taken home to their families
"For long term renters and property owners, have rental agreements for longer periods of time eg 1 year with 2 or 3 year options.

And have agreed rental increases for at least one year in advance so that the agent can't get greedy and substantially increase the rent when your lease is about to expire.

The only reason most real estate agents will not issue rental agreements for any longer than one year, is because they get paid extra money every time they issue a new rental agreement.  So that commission would be lost if they issued longer leases.

By not having longer leases the renter is less likely to invest/upgrade things in their rental property as they don't know if they will be there next year."
"More rights for pet owners.
Rent control
"
Rules around pets
Some women flee FDV and not everyone has the ability to take out an order. Without an order women cannot prove DFV and this places them at risk of homelessness. It needs to be easier to factor in vulnerability for seeking housing. It needs to be easier to remove debt incurred by DFV. 
Ensuring that reporting regulations and requirements for Property Managers / Companies are followed and met so that landlords and/or tenants don't get a surprise of massive repair bills at an exit inspection as recently happened to me. 
The amount of entry notices in one year should be monitored.
More information available to landlords from RTA for tenants that leave and do not provide forwarding address
More flexibility/allowance for pets would substantially decrease stress upon moving house.
"Better communication from owners and real-estate. Have been asking to get a couple of things fixed for almost 5-6 months and nothing is being done about it. Have been brought up multiple times with real-estate and they always respond with ""We are still trying to get in contact with the owner"". This has happened with 2 of the rentals we have been in now."
i still have quarterly inspections even though i have been renting the same property for 15 years. it would also be good to have longer than 1 yr rental agreements
make it illegal to exclude pets - I have a very well behaved and well trained older cat who mainly lives indoors but an still excluded from some properties even though I can provide excellent references for us both.
Limit the number of investment properties that an individual owner can have!
"We are renting  and in the past have had major issues with property managers, either not responding to emails or returning phone calls and then when you make a complaint about them to there managers they make life hell for you "
"make it illegal for a tenant to stop paying rent to use up the bond. make rent payable to the last day then have the bond for repairs, cleaning and yard only"
Stop imposing more rules and obligations on the property owners 
"Allowing people to have pets - i don't think a pet bond is a good idea. It allows them to use your pet as an excuse to take the money. Some places said the owner hates cats so you can have a dog or no dogs just cats. I feel like you need permission for a plant or a fish. 

Allowing you to do what you would like in your own home within reason - I don't smoke but i don't want someone telling me I can't If i wanted to. 

Can't put hooks in the wall to make it homely. 

Entry condition reports are a joke - you get 48 hours to try and go through every single nook and cranny in the house and you can never pick up everything and get blamed. 

Entry notices - we had a realeaste agent that issued an entry notice every week and came in to our house. They didn't care if we were home or not - i may not own the house but all my personal belongings and dog is in it. No privacy. "
Being able to have tenants pay the full amount of damage caused and not just the rental bond. 
"More rights for tenants to ensure longer term housing security through long leases, and the ability to undertake minor cosmetic changes to properties such as painting walls etc."
"The price of rent. It would have been good to have been able to rent something bigger, but trying to find something affordable beyond 2 bedrooms was impossible for us."
"Have mandatory bond cleans, carpet cleans and pest sprays with each tenancy - or owner if it is being tenanted for the first time."
I think that the landlord is not protected enough against damage and loss of rent
More/better communication between Agents & Tenants (& Owners)
"Making landlords more accountable for their actions ,and having financial penalties for landlords who are delinquent with regards to safety and the condition of the property they are renting out"
lower vacancy rates
We have had a few maintenance issues which were not dealt with in a timely manner. It takes several emails/texts before our property manager deals with any issues. 
Be able to hang pictures on walls. Allow tenants with pets in any house with a yard as long as the tenant has a good rental history 
"Permission to have pets in any rental property, provided the tenant takes care of any damage that may have been caused and having the premises fumigated when moving out of the property."
Allow good tenants to have bond money transferred when moving as it is very expensive to have to come up with that large amount as it used to be but for already proven great tenants I understand there are bad tenants but reward the great ones.
"Make it easier to move, more protection from agents who do not maintain property standards, stop crazy high ‘break lease’ fees, allow pets, hang pictures and a place to report dodgy leases."
A move level playing field for owners and tenants.
Stability in long term tenancy & being able to have a gardenbed or hang pictures
"The ability to rent long-term (lease periods greater than 12 months) and to truly make it your home (hang pictures on walls, have pets, ability to re-paint or make minor non-structural modifications, etc.) so long as it is returned to its original state (plus fair wear and tear) at the end of the lease, similarly to a commercial rental."
Notice Periods for Tenants and Landlords should be the same
"Requirement for owners to attend to maintenance requests within certain timeframes, otherwise ability for tenants to deduct rent"
Tenants to have more 'allowances' in the home such as hanging pictures/mounting furniture to walls for child safety/animals/water usage etc
Push to have lower rent due to no maintenance work done for about 20 years
"Length of leases, for some families a long lease is essential. We have been subject to rent hikes and had house sold on us twice "
"Make moving around more affordable, so that rental increases werent so much of an issue."
"Allow tenants to put up photos, allow dogs and allow 2 car parks per unit in apartment buildings."
Making sure that the real estate agent is managing the property properly
Being able to speak to owner directly
Rent to buy options.  Find it difficult to pay rent and try and save money for a deposit to buy your own place.  
Provide the ability to charge a larger (double) bond where tenants want to have pets on the premises
More funding from the government so I'm able to live in a place with good public transportation and access to healthcare without it using 2/3 of my fortnightly centrelink pay
"More control over control of how the property is used. So long as I return the house in good condition the owner should not dictate whether I can have a cat, or put safety fasteners in walls so my daughter doesn't kill herself knocking over a set of drawers. My daughter's safety should not be put at risk for an investment property."
To have periodic tenancies. Especially after successfully signing more then 2-3 fixed term tenancies in the same property. 
"Accessibility to alternative options regarding utilities eg. Solar power, water charges to be as an excess only, especially when maintaining gardens & cleaning rental properties."
Ensure the legislation respects the rights of the landlord. Some of us are not wealthy and the rent pays for groceries   
"As a landlord, more control over your property. Currently extremely biased towards a tenant."
Allow Bond transfer
More control for landlords -- tenants have too much power.
"As an owner of a rental property I believe that there should be a change in this difference: the Lessor being required to give the tenant 2 months' notice to leave, while the tenant is only required to give 2 weeks.  "
More responsibility on tenant to take care of the property and fix broken items when they have caused the issue.
"lower and stabilised rent
minimum standards and facilities in rental properties
getting rid of no-grounds evictions
longer leases
no random inspections
Pets allowed
Better support with RTA"
"Larger bond being mandatory. one months rent is not sufficient to cover, general cleaning, minor repairs, garden maintenance service which is left unkempt, and 2 weeks missed rent which happens to us every time."
A much better real estate management.
"Improve ability for the owner to inforce penalties or better safety nets from
Tenants missing rental payments.
Also inforce penalities or better safety nets from tenants not respecting house rules in sharing accomodation. 
 "
Having more consistent laws to support landlord when tenant is in breach of agreement
Allow Landlords to have more rights considering they are the ones that own the property & pay for it's upkeep.
Remove the 'nanny-state' rules around annual external fire alarm inspections and having to have cleats attached to window frames by law.  
Pet bonds. Making it more fair. Owning an investment property is heavily weighted toward the tenant with our laws and the Act. 
"Making the owner pay a bond, so that when something needs fixing the tenant doesn't have to wait months to get it fixed it comes out of the owners bond. A rental house should be safe before it is aloud to be rented."
Make property owners and managers enforce the rental contract conditions  re: issues relating to amenity / noise / criminal activity with a rental property. 
"Allowing pets on tenancies with less discrimination. It's very difficult to rent having 2 dogs and given the absolute unaffordability of homes, we can't buy a place for many years."
Real estate agents should be encouraged to provide further information to their tenants
Increased acceptance of pets
"Being able to rent a property without physically having to inspect it - especially when the property is more than a day's drive eg: living in Gold Coast, looking to rent in Mackay."
"It would be wonderful if it was easier to have pets and make the property more homely/personal ie in new homes without colour of pictures or gardens, have the ability to paint, place picture hooks, landscape etc.
"
I’m am sick and tired of having to inhale second hand cigarette smoke every time time I open my doors and windows or walk outside my apartment. It needs be made legislation that smokers need to follow the same anti smoking laws that they do everywhere else they go in public. This is just not good enough! 
Giving tenants less than 2 months notice to vacant when they only have to give 2 weeks.
"Cancel fixed term lease completely, all leases should be on periodic lease with 30 days notification from both parties. 30 days is time long enough for lessor to find new tenants. 30 days is time long enough for tenant to find new property. This would take a huge stress off from property managers, thousands of disputes and claims from QCAT and RTA ! "
Currently it’s the owner doing shoddy repairs. Standard quality would be better. I also think rentals should be transparent about asbestos in buildings. 
Better rights for landlords to deal with non compliant tenants
When it comes to collecting you're bond it doesn't matter if you get a bond cleaner or not you never get it all back no matter what there is always something. 
"stop real estate agents on-charging bank fees for paying rent.
I currently have no fee-free way to pay rent other than direct deposit.
I don't trust agents with bank account details."
Better communication with Real Estate
Prevent misleading advertising
The way my property manager treats me 
More clarity and easy to understand terms - plain English. 
A database of current renters to enable landlords to identify risks.  
Taking the power away from real estate agents who are tyrannical.
Fairer legislation for landlords. 
I feel it’s unfair on Lessors that they have to give tenants 2 months notice to leave when the tenant only has to give two weeks.
"Rent payment. Any default should rectified immediately. And if not possible, next steps should be instigated within days."
Make the tenant more accountable for treatment of and damage caused to the property.  Tenants should use common sense/take more responsibility in dealing with minor issues that come up. 
"Have rules about everything, no more ambiguity "
"Allow more freedom to personalise the house - hanging pictures, having pets, etc. Most people know how to do these things respectfully without making permanent and unrecoverable damage and they make SO much difference to the atmosphere of a family and home."
"Being an aged pensioner couple we sudgest that rents be set to a maximum, though we are satisfied with our accomadations and have no viable complaints, all is OK."
No direct communication with owner.  Tenant MUST be present during inspection 
Some things on both sides tenants and landlords need improving
Keep rents affordable and lower. They should never be the same as a mortgage repayment!!!
Making it easier to stand up for your rights as a tenant without risking your reputation for future rentals
Avoid proposed rent increases during tenancy. 
"More comprehensive Entry condition report when property not managed by agent, it is managed by owner."
"I would create a public database of properties or real estate agencies with their evaluations/ratings and allow interested potential tenants to access it. Properties and real estate agents that loose a case or decide to come to an agreement in a Fair Trading court would have their name listed (and basic details of the matter). Another very important thing is to disallow a property to be sold within 3 months a tenant moves in, unless in special circumstances."
"Being allowed to have pets, install pet doors and being allowed to treat the home as if I own it and hang pictures etc"
Have unbiased property managers that follow the Real Estate laws.
Approval for pets. Pictures etc around the house. Property managers that expect a house to be spotless.
An independent party to access upon vacating 
Make renting more affordable for pensioners. 
Longer tenancy agreements
"Be able to make minor alterations ie hang pictures, paint etc."
The accountability of property managers 
longer leases 6 - 12 months is too short.  need to be able to lock in for a lot longer if you want to
Terms of lease to short
Agents to be more accountable for arranging and following up on authorised maintenance 
Ability to make minor personal renovations/cosmetic changes (hanging pictures etc.) 
Easier to get house i had place 47 application before got my house im in now
Be able able to pay my rent by direct credit to Estate Agent instead of through the REConnect oneCard mob......which cost me fees monthly. Not happy!
Have rental managers be more reasonable when it comes to final inspection for return of bond. I have left every rental cleaner than when I moved in yet almost every time they have tried to claim that it is not up to standard for full return of bond and I have had to go back and clean again. This has been infuriating! Why did they not make the tenant before me return to clean better??? I feel it is just an attempt to unlawfully take money from the bond in the hope that the vacating tenant will not fight it.
Introduce longer term rentals and pet bonds.
"Allow me to organise repairs, as the real estate is ignoring requests. I would be happy to submit quotes, so long as I can guarantee the repairs are completed."
The high cost of renting (I pay $460 a week)
Get rid of lazy property managers
Less flexibility for landlords to select tenants on whatever basis they choose. Legislation that prohibits tenants needing to offer more money when in competition for a place. Less frequent rental inspections after the first year of tenancy.
"As a property owner, I feel that when tenants do the wrong thing, they have more rights than I do as a landlord. Whilst most tenants abide by the rules, others don't, and when disputes arise, often it's not worth the effort as the RTA tends to favour the tenant in its decisions. "
Property owners should be able to have more say in the tenants they get.  This may prevent damage to property by children etc
Make it clear who is responsible for what. E.g. lawns & gardens. What is tenant clearly responsible for and what is landlord clearly responsible for... eliminate the grey areas.
have a better contract that is fair to both parties
Making property managers more accountable 
Allowing pets like dogs/cats. 
"That the process of inspection, applying be more personal. It is really difficult to attend inspoections with 25 other interested people- and attempting to juggle around work commitments etc- I miss the days I could look at a property with a set of keys.

"
Nothing - I'm happy with the way things are working currently.
At present the bond is insufficient to cover property damage by tenants and a three month turn around to satisfy disputes is ridiculously long. The idea that people who own properties are rich moguls is utterly ridiculous and most are mum and dad investors who have worked hard and have planned for retirement so that they ARE NOT a burden to the community.
If a home has solar and owener wants to keep it in there name to maintain rebate. All Benifits should be past on to renters as they are renting the infrastructure that is creating the power.
"Better communication between tenants and landlords. Landlords realizing that the tenant, in most cases, is just wanting a home to live in, not someplace to trash. When tenants are allowed to treat the house as a home, like being allowed to put up pictures, they are more likely to respect the house as a home as they will feel at 'home'"
To be able to make the house/unit that I rent feel like a home.  By being able to hang pictures on walls etc.  
Come inline with other states and improve availability of pet friendly rentals 
"Better/more communication between tenant, agent (real estate) and owner when requesting enhancments or improvements."
Real estates attempting to claim bond despite issues being raised on entry reports
"1) Up front communication for known issues with the property -i.e. faulty garage door and how to operate 
2) Credit system that allows good tenants will face lessor inspection and easy to get next rental without hassle
3) Remove unnecessary surcharge over all rental payments by removing surcharge fee on bank payments
4) Credit low water users by allowing minimum 30000 L water usage allowance before charging water
"
Being able to store and sign documents electronically
Water utilities should be payable by tenant (as per power/gas and other services).
"Look at European models in general. Renting feels temporary in QLD, and the place never feels like your home."
"If you are happy with the rental property itself and you are a good tenant, but you complain to the owner about the way you are treated, you are faced with ""well you can always move"" or non-renewal of the lease. The option to move elsewhere represents a much greater hardship to the tenant than it does to the owner as the rental property becomes their home. So tenants tend not to complain and suffer in silence. I don't know what could be done about this but perhaps non-renewals of leases could be more justified by the owners so that tenants could have more security of tenure.   "
Make real estate property managers more accountable and limit the number of properties a property manager can be managing 
"Stop allowing renters to do as they please. Property owners bear the costs of damage done by tenants, then have the worst time trying to get bad tenants out."
More properties to allow pets. Less extremely personal questions asked during rental application. 
"Ability to clarify rules and regulations around repairs and maintenance. Allowing pets up to a certain size per dwelling but having specific restrictions (such as annual pest control, damage obligations and noise restrictions). "
Request for repairs to the property shouldn't take follow up emails to remind them.  
"I've never any problems renting, I have always looked after my rentals. I do own a house in Rosedale Qld and I have always been honest and up front as to why my son and I require a rental property."
The time frames to evict a bad tenant 
"Minimum notice periods for when a property is listed for sale. For example, from the time the F10 is issued, 7 days should be left before agent or lessor can take advertising photos."
Not having to beg to have a pet or put pictures on the walls
More protection for tenants and a government run register for black listed tenants as I have experienced malicious blacklisting and had to go through QCAT to have resolved. 
"Pets allowed inside in all rental properties.
It was very hard to find a rental property.

Also need realestate agents who care more about their tennants (where their money is actually coming from not the landlord)"
A relaxation in the stringent conditions owners/real estate agents are allowed to put in lease agreements. 
"Stricter laws with return of bond. 
I left my place almost 3 weeks ago. 
I requested being in attendance for the walk through. The property manager agreed, and then went ahead and did it without me. (Ray White)
Following unanswered calls and emails I was finally told that they are waiting to hear back from the property owner who lives in Melbourne before returning my bond. Am a single middle aged  female, living on my own and left the place spotless. Being told ""I work for the owner not you"", by the property manager left me gobsmacked.

At my last rental place 6 years prior, the owner tried to keep my bond on the basis that he felt the narrow strip of shrubs behind my unit wasn't at a standard he thought was high enough. I organised a remediation with the RTA, which was unsuccessful. I then organised a court hearing and he revoked his statement prior to the hearing. This took time, effort and was highly stressful for me. "
"Consultation with a tenant seems to be a taboo subject. Why shouldn't a tenant get a chance to be consulted when issues arise. Owners talk about how they want tenants to ""look after my property"" but nobody seems too interested in fixing the minor issues that arise that ultimately could point to something larger going on. If the tenant sends an email about a leaking tap, its not because they are being precious, its largely because they are trying to ""look after the property""!"
allow tenants to have pets by removing all-inclusive 'no pets' rules
Recognition of the investment by property owners in respect to outstanding rents. These are difficult to recover at best. 
"Rental agents can be hard to deal with sometimes.
Also, more pet friendly places should be available."
"that owners do not keep properties & fixtures/fittings in good condition.  AC unit is not considered an 'essential item', so you rent a property with one, breaks down 2 weeks after entry and is never fixed.
Placing pictures on walls - owners should put up the hooks then no problem"
"I would like to see a larger bond, as if damage has occurred four weeks bond does not go far to repair replace ready for re-renting."
lowering the price of weekly rent to make it more affordable
Timeframes for Property Manager responses to maintenance issues
Realtors and owners need to actually care about carrying out maintenance issues highlighted by tenants during tenancy to help tenants safeguard rights and ensure full bond refund at conclusion of tenancy
"Promote recognition of tenants as an asset to the property owner and recognise that even as a tenant, I should feel that the property is my home to reasonably manage and habitate as I see fit."
Didn't rent very long in the open market. 
Longer notice period when lessor ending lease to sell or ending periodic lease.  Renters need time to find something alternative.  Can be a very stressfull time for people.
"Ability to have a pet, nail photos and art on the wall and change wall colours."
property report accountability
Queensland seems to have more paperwork for buying or renting out a investment residential property
DOH/Rental Agencies/Landlords must begin to differentiate between chronic bad renters with repeat bad behaviour from those who have clean records and positive referrals. Bad behaviour from renters/owners must be more heavily penalised and good behaviour of quality renters should be rewarded with advantages/incentives offered to said individuals.  
Have tenants be accountable and take responsibility for their (negative) actions.
"The real estate representative to adjust attitude toward tenants. The process of contact with owner in regards to property, there seems to be an unsurety as to communication with owner in regards repair maintenance and requests for options to continue lease for up to 3, 5, + years. I enquired about longer lease with agent to be told NO we don't do that. Why not assess on merit of previous rental record. Especially for older people. Greater transparency required by agencies in the dealings with owners and tenants.
"
"Legislative reforms enabling and compelling tennats and LANDLORDS/Property managers to comply with the contract. Enable Fines/ penalty units for both if they do not comply!
Ability for a tennant to break the contract and leave with no financial responsibility towards the property (in terms of rent till their contract ends) if the real estate/owner/property manager isnt not complying with the contract!

For example Two individual properties in the last year ive had to take all the way to mediation and one is pending a qcat date over Real estates breaching contracts.  
One for excessive cleaning charges after demanding we use their cleaners and the seconds over failing to maintain the property. The owner doesnt want to replace the items so just drags his feet and the property manager plays along. (Oven, Dishwasher, Airconditioners, carpets and curtains all broken or damaged needing replacement) 

Agents and landlords know that breach notices are little more than a nasty worded letter, Mediation is just toothless talking on the phone (with no ability to use whats said as evidence let alone compel or argue in anyone's favor.) and Generally QCAT will rule in the favour of the landlord as 90% of the QCAT tribunal members are not at all impartial to renting in QLD. 
"
Landlords to be accountable for promises made to tenants.
More reviews and compliance checking with Property Management agencies.
"Lower body corp fees
Claim GST back 
Reduce insurance costs
Lower council fees
"
"Tenants should have more flexibility to make minor modifications to properties to make it a home, for example, be able to hang pictures on walls, paint walls, plant gardens etc."
"Tenants can damage unit and it is up to the owner to chase costs though a overloaded court process. Costs of rental agency add to the costs.
"
being able to get things fixed in a timely manner
Increase bond amount so as to cover for possible rent arrears and damage to property on exit.
"Land lords/agents understanding RTA act better and not feeling like as a tenant we have to make to landlord/agent happy and to bend to their will, other wise the lease will not be renewed. "
My real estate agent
Allow proven reliable renters to have a pet.
More rights for renters in terms of painting and hanging pictures
"Why does an owner need to give 2 months notice, but a tenant can leave with 2 weeks notice."
"the time it takes the real estate agent to organise requests eg safety lock in bathroom, from the tenant that I have agreed to being done."
We now rent direct from the owners due to the agency not complying with the Act and not carrying out the owners instructions regarding property maintenance. Agencies in Qld are a law unto themselves and need seriously reigning in.
"Nothing, I am very fortunate to rent a quality apartment in a well managed apartment block in the centre of the City."
"Clearer rules for tenants regarding looking after the property and their obligations. Provide consistent answers to tenants (the RTA) when tenants call about their liabilities to pay for damage. 
Encourage tenants to take their own set of photos upon entry."
Cost restriction. How did it get so high when our wages and welfare payments are so low?
Agents feeling they can take advantage of tenants particularly through increasing property rent with no economic proof
Price increases in rent
Dealing with owners directly instead of property managers that do nothing
RTA is actually a supportive service that helps renters. Mediation services are ineffective and inefficient. Real estates are aware of this and abuse the faulty system to take advantage of renters. 
Having a competent real estate that takes my concerns about their ineptitude seriously
"Try to ensure that tenants, owners and managers of rental properties are all treated with honesty and respect, and that no bullying is allowed. I can't rent my house without tenants; tenants can't rent a house without an owner. Managers make the renting possible, accountable and easy. We all need each other. "
"More circumstantial allowances to be given to breaking leases in emergency situations to be improved and adjusted (more lenient approach to be given for matters involving domestic violence, unhealthy houses ie mould etc etc)."
Landlords should have to have a bond with RTA to pay for maintenance to stop investors who can’t afford to run property as in do normal maintenance involved in home ownership from leaving tenants to pay for repairs and maintenance.
Honest communication from Tenant 
Make tenants more responsible for repairs when they break something that is obviously not normal wear and tear. 
Better rights for good tenants 
It would be nice if landlords actually gave a damn about the state of repair of the properties they're expecting us all to pay no small sum to rent. 
longer lease period to ensure stable tenure
More flexibility in making minor alterations (such as hooks / putting up pictures) to the property.
Limited ability to secure a rental property in advance of relocating from interstate - needed to live in a hotel until I found permanent rental accommodation
Real estates being more organised and on the ball. 
Sell the house that we have lost so much money on and the rent does not even cover half of our mortgage
to be treated equally or given the same respect as owners - we are not second class peolpe  
easier access to find good quality house; access to the rental record of tenants who broke contract.  
That all items that require maintenance and repairs are carried out before a property is allowed to be rented out. Don't wait for the tenant to raise the problem first and then take action.
Tenants have far too much leway when it comes to disputes. 
Pets and air-conditioning for all rentals
That there is not an inspection every three months and to be able to have the opportunity to rent any property with my dog.
"Tenants should not need approval for cats and dogs. If you can have it on your property as an owner, you should be able to have it on your property as a tenant. "
A better way to advise rental property owners that your tenants are excellent tenants and will do everything above and beyond as tenants so that owners would be more open to long term tenancies over 12 months. 
More feedback from owners regarding their satisfaction or otherwise with our tenancy
When moving accommodation suggest that the Bond held by RTA for current property should be allocated to new property. Finding further bond money while one is still held by RTA is very difficult. I have had to borrow the bond money during this interim period.
Electricity is provided by body corporate. So individual meters and choice of electricity providers would be good
pets allowed in all rental properties
the prices of rent its difficult to afford a nice home on a low income we have had to downgrade to a unit
Remove the water charges from the cost of renting. 
"the owners saying a property was damaged when it wasn't and making tenants pay $900 to have a professional cleaner when cleaning yourself is good enough.
Asking owners to fix or maintain things gets you kicked out or they refuse and expect you to keep paying rent "
Restrict the amount and time limit of rent increases
The ability to give 6 weeks notice to leave a property without being liable for the remainder of 12 month rental contract or advertising to attract new tenants.
"Less inspections or the ability to send the real estate photos yourself if your inspections are always ""perfect"".  Less hassle for pet owners, as a cat owner we have never been allowed to have your cat inside.  Even though laws state that cats can't leave your property.  We have had to keep the cat inside, but hide it away for inspections so they don't know.  It seems ridiculous to not allow cats inside, my kids do more damage than my cat does!"
"Less strict property managers. 
Agents that actually fix faulty items. 
Stop ripping tenants off claiming their whole bond over something minor. 
Stop aents claiming they are always right. "
As a property manager I think in regards to the tenants vacating notice periods or owners giving notice to leave the legislation favours the tenants.
Landlords need more rights 
Make it easier for tenants with pets to rent a property
Quicker feedback about things needing attention 
Earn interest on Bond!
Make rules for tenants same as for owners. Notice periods for tenants and owners should be the same. Reduce the notice period required by owners for rent increases and terminations.
Not having 3monthly inspections especially for long time tennancy
"Body corporates need total overhaul, too many regulations, too many by-laws, too expensive"
Rules around pets
House Condition - I think the last rental has been substandard for Student accommodation. Price was affordable but the home itself was really substandard.
Have water use charged directly to tenant rather than current convoluted system of trying to get reimbursed via tenant via property manager.
"
Tenants with bad rental history be recorded more truthfully"
"Less paperwork - entry conditions should already be completed by rental agent.  I should only have to tick/cross, not fill in all the details myself.  They should have already checked for faults & damage."
Previous landlord was dishonest and didn't return bond to son
Property managers who understand rental issues and don't treat tenants like a lower class of society. Realistic time frames at end of lease and inspections. ie seeking renewal of tenancy agreement 3 months prior to it expiring.
having a rental to move in without having to clean it first
Tnts to be more responsible in looking after other people’s property. 
"More control when the owner wants to sell their property. when in financial hardship, the tenant can make to so hard for them. "
"A fairer system for landlords when tenants default. Currently, if a tenant falls behind in rent and the Property Manager takes immediate action at 2 days' default and 7 days' default, it can take a further 3 weeks to gain vacant possession (if the tenant is willing to leave). This only leaves 1 week's bond to cover the rent default, the cleaning bill, garden clean up and any damage that may have occurred."
Renting prices for those not working and have retired is too high.
Easier access to rentals
Can’t think of anything currently 
"Tenants should all be scored like they are for a finance score so the property owner can judge what quality of tenant they are. The higher the score maybe the cheaper the rental??

The tenants can do whatever they like in a rental - take drugs, demolish the place, leave it filthy yet there is very little recourse for the property owner. Tenants who wreck a place can get their name cleared on the TICA database after only a few years and can do it all again on some other unsuspecting property owner. You really have no idea who you are really renting your property out to and if they will pay the rent and look after your property.  Too much responsibility is placed on the property owner which makes it a legal nightmare renting your property. Smoke alarms even cords for blinds are all the landlord's responsibility. We are not a Nanny State...the tenant should take responsibility for their own children making sure they don't mess with the blind cords in the first place. Everything becomes the landlord's responsibility for safety - not fair!"
"More/better communication from property managers. They seem to treat tenants as an inconvenience or an irritation and rarely have any respect for them. I’ve frequently been fobbed off and forgotten by them when chasing up repairs. They routinely show up outside the 2 hour inspection window provided on the entry notice, often without giving a reason or apology.

We had an entire real estate office close down and transfer our tenancy to another branch without any notification at all. When our calls about repairs weren’t being connected we went to the office to find it completely gutted. We had to contact their head office to finally be told what was going on. "
Make professional cleaning and carpet cleaning compulsory so I know the home will be left clean by the last person 
Dishonest property managers need to be easily reported.
Availability outside of working hours to view properties 
Lower rental costs 
Price and quality of homes
Make it easier to be successful in gaining rental accommodation and also lower rental prices. I currently am in a rental home but it is extremely hard to move. 
Contact with the owners by email so the real estate and owners can't blame one another when repairs need to be done and they say they were not told by the real estate
Enact legislation to enable single renters and the elderly to have small pets.  
Knowing most about my rights as a tenant 
Routine inspections if a long time renter in same property 
"To change breaking contract conditions:
A tenant has usually 20 min to inspect a property. And if the contract is signed the very strict breaking conditions applied. In my case, 1 week fee+ 300 AUD advirtising and weekly payment untill new tenents are found. I think it is unfair, because it serves only rental property agency interests."
Ability of renters to access timely repairs to the property
Increase rental lengths dramatically.
Make it that pets are welcome to be kept in rentals as a basic right. Allow tenants to hang photos etc. as long as the condition is kept acceptable
"location if possible, would rather rent on acreage."
Have a landlord willing to maintain their home and we would love to have pets. 
Rental agents are unconsionable people who have any sense of morality removed before taking the position
Have repairs done in a timely manner
"Greater focus on tenant satisfaction. 
More information about who has responsibility for repairs and upkeep. 
Reduce fear of retaliation by property manager or owner when raising issues with the rental for repair. 
Increased responsiveness of property managers for repair requests."
Penalties for rental agencies who willfully flout their responsibilities/the relevant laws around their conduct
Longer leases. Not so many entries into the home. 
Give younger peoplr a fair go. We arent all party animals. Dont discriminate 
"The building I live in won a UDIA award for best building in Australia yet air conditioning breaks down once per month, the heat from the fully glassed walls keeps the apartment at a regular temperature of 28 degrees (unacceptable). How do big developers get these buildings approved when they are not suitable to live in. You must check with residents before issuing awards."
"Agent should never give out keys from there friends. Just to check tenants. And go throuh personal belongings of tenant.
 agent and property manager should respect tenants. 
While renting.
They should stop acting and treat tenant like we're  nothing useless."
Dogs must be allowed unless there is an appeal by the landlord. Dogs are family. 
More realistic expectations around routine inspections
Keen to support renters with pets
"Reduce 3 monthly inspections, it's intrusive and we havee demonstrated we are good tenants. "
The fact that there is no cap on rent increases. Such as a percentage per year. 
"Compulsory environmentally-sound features in newly-built rental properties
"
Attitude of real estate agents to tenants.
"Better release of information and pictures real-estate on websites, pictures not to include parks etc"
the ability to go on a periodic lease rather than contract
When Tenants move make sure the house is left in the same condition as provided to them. ie: Any damage repaired. 
More options for pet friendly rentals and more landlords willing to allow pets in properties. 
"Laws seem to favour tenants which reduces investor confidence and means less rental properties available or higher rent charged as ""defacto"" insurance "
More transparency in agent fees / standardised ways of presenting them
Regulations on number of properties an agent can manage to insure appropriate amount of attention is payed to a property. 
"Inspection feels like an invasion. Expectations are always different ranging from reasonable to ridiculous.
Pets aren’t allowed inside"
Have more freedom with personalising and be allowed to have a pet
Give more power to home owners 
for pets to be accepted and for things to be fixed faster and to be treated right if someone has a disability 
"Having more freedom to decorate (i.e putting things on walls, painting, gardening)"
Option to Electronically receive documents like entry notices & renewal of leases for signing to be able to keep on file easily.
Allow pets as a standard in all rentals. 
The rules on selling houses that people are currently renting
"The lack of recognition by property managers that tenants are their clients too, not just the property owners, which leads to an attitude that tenants concerns are of no account, they do not have to be treated fairly, or with respectful decency. That tenants are mere rent paying temporary occupants, not complete people who might be attached to the idea of having a home and all that entails."
"Having read many of the discussion threads, many issues seem to arise because agents misrepresent the owners to the tenant (or the tenant to the owner). For example refusing repairs or demanding unreasonable conditions or access. A mechanism to ensure, while maintaining privacy to some extent, that the owner and tenant can communicate directly without the agent able to modify or mis-represent the message."
"Access to utilities that are customised for renters (e.g. quick setup of internet connections, split billing with housemates)"
"would appreciate fans/air cond in the community housing house, expecting dsp recipients to pay structural changes to the roof of he building at their own expense in crazy, "
Owner needs to repair/replace things that need doing. 
Personally I’ve been lucky enough to have great PMs however communication needs to be improved and possibly reporting maintenance.
I need tenants to be more accountable
Shorter timeframes for removing bad tenants. 
"Flexibility to make the house a home. Despite having a dog and spending weeks trying to find a house that will allow pets, it can be frustrating having to deal with real estates when trying to get maintenance done or any additions to houses. For example, if the shower head of the home is in poor condition, I requested if I could swap it out for a better one, and either leave the new one there or put the old back at my rental but my real estates answer was ‘well Ask the owner’ and they never got back to me after several attempts. Having one room in the house with 9 hooks and none anywhere else in the house also makes it hard to try and make it a home. I have a perfect rental record and I keep my homes in immaculate conditions. I am more than happy to coordinate with owners to find the perfect solution but sometimes it’s way too hard to get anything done so it’s easier to just live with the sadness."
Having less inspections and more ability to make it our own
More understanding from property managers that the property I rent is my home. 
More contact with the rental agency.
Pets being aloud more often.
It's too expensive for a single person. I don't want to live in share housing but that isn't how houses are built here.
Enforcement of laws that require real estate agents to quickly respond to repair issues in unit.  
"Provide a feedback and rating system of landlords, agents and tenants.

Provide for transfer of bonds. We used to do this routinely but now no agents allow this. "
More accountability on the property managers. (Real estate agents) to do what you pay them to. 
The power real estate property managers have to make you feel so small even when you have done nothing wrong.
"Updating NRAS so a single person earning under 60k, with a HECS/HELP debt doesn't spend over a third of their net fortnightly income on a studio apartment."
less power for tenants
Ability to rent with a pet
More ability to hang pictures.
Make property owner or managers responsible for pets that are abandoned by previous tenants. Distressed animals should not have to be cared for  or arrangements made for their well being by other tenants.
Make it mandatory for tenants as part of their lease to have an automatic payment set up for rent payments.
Owners fixing stuff quicker 
The way renters are treated by both agents and owners. The fact that I cant get basic repairs done and the agents are of no help. The way owners hold onto water bills and send 5 or 6 in row and you have a huge debt.
Follow how Victoria has done. Allowing only Bond to be four weeks rent and not whatever the home owner/real estate wants it to be. Only allowing rent increases to be once a year with massive notice. Allowing the people renting the property to hang photos or paintings on the walls always.
Landlords should allow tenants to make their rental house feel like a home by personalising it as long as it is returned to the original condition (at the tenant's expense) when the tenant vacates the property. When repairs or cleaning is not carried out it should not be made the responsibility of the new tenant to rectify. RTA should check previous vacate reports before penalising tenants and not giving bond back. Homeowners should have adequate insurance for accidental breakages and should not come out of the tenant's pocket. Tenants pay huge rent and then lose their bond unnecessarily on top of the outlay. There is no respect for privacy when renting - maintenance people are given keys to the property without your approval/knowledge. 
More properties need to accept pets and landlords more responsive on maintenance
Ensure that the renters are satisfied with the house the way it is BEFORE they move in.
Balance rules back to property owner interest - they are the one paying it off/own it. 
"As an agent the biggest issue is notice periods - i believe notice periods for all parties should be equal. Tenants should not be able to give two weeks notice and the owner have to give 60 days.
It should be a level playing field of 4 weeks for all parties unless for breach of agreement which should remain at 7 days."
I'm a single female on a single minimum wage and is a responsible pet owner. I love my dog like it's my child and can't seem to find many affordable rentals properties in Cairns that allow pets. If I'd have to pick one thing to change it would be to change prices on renting to be more affordable for low income earners. 
That Private renting needs to be more regulated 
"Allow renters to make the rental their ""home"" while living there. Most landlords and property managers expect us to behave like we are in a holiday let or hotel room. 
Tenants should be able to hang pictures, secure furniture to walls, live in the home as you should be able to do.  Having said this, it is expected that the house will be handed back to the landlord/property manager in the same condition with things repaired, however general wear and tear should be accepted and tenants not crucified. Pets should always be considered - Pets on Application -  proof of council registration, vet checks, photo and references.  "
Make it easier for people with pets. 
Making tenants more accountable for damage done to the property.  
Have the Government change their ruling on travel to inspect the property personally as this involves interstate travel.
To be able to terminate tenancy for damages
Larger bonds to pay for damage caused by renters.
"Making Landlords accountable for fixing problems in their property. Not having to fill out form, give to real estate, they respond 7 days later (which counts as a response, then giving another form another 7 days... and problems never getting fixed because they use the paperwork as an excuse."
Water usage charges funded by the tenant - passing that to the landlord removes any control of investment
"I am a landlord. Renting experience in Brisbane is different to regional area. With the re nats dropping by $100/week and not getting quality tenants is a problem. And cost of cost of maintenance is going up. 

Some agents having online maintenance requests just causes maintenance requests so often from the tenants. It is a stressful experience.

I feel the agents in Brisbane are more professional and the vacancy rate may be lower. "
Agents tend to bully tenants regarding defects and nit-pick about minor imperfections when tenants finish cleaning after vacating the property.  I would like to see an independent arbiter assess the property immediately after the cleaning process is complete.  Agents should also have to inspect the property immediately after cleaning (not five days later).  This might give a fairer and more reasonable outcome for tenants who diligently clean and maintain the rental property.
The way real estates treat renters
Agents caring more about tenants and the properties they manage
"I think the notice periods to end a lease should be the same for tenants and landlords, not the current 2 weeks for tenants and 2 months for landlords - I think a months notice for both parties is fair."
"Being able to get a cat and a dog for my daughters. Also, being able to put up curtains for privacy in our lounge room."
"The amount of inspections I have. I have never been late in paying, no damage and always have excellent house inspections.  
I feel with my record they could move my inspections from every 3 months to 6 monthly. "
Ability to check applicants backgrounds before they become your tennant
Tenants quite often expect too much. I have to make do with minor inconveniences in my home until I can afford to make the repair. Tenants expect even minor repairs to be immediately attended to not considering the financial position of the landlord who must budget for any unexpected repair. Owning a rental property does not put you into the category of the privileged.
The property values have declined dramatically and it is not a viable investment
"Tenants should provide their new address after vacating a property in case there are questions (eg, what is the password for the alarm or security cameras?) or an insurance claim which may need evidence from the tenant. Also the bond should be significantly higher (double) if there is a dog. We incurred expenses of almost $10,000 after a tenant brought 2 un-authorised large dogs into our house - we had to replace all of the carpet (in a 2 storey 4-bedroom home) which was torn and eaten, we had to fumigate the house and yard due to fleas, and the pile of poop after they vacated was almost 1 metre high! (Also several of our plaster walls were cracked & had holes, a window was broken, the garage floor was soaked in dog urine, paintwork was damaged, the laundry cupboard stank from dried human urine from the upstairs toilet, etc). Needless to say they did not compensate us for the costs (except for the broken window - but we had to pay ourselves for a matching 2nd window because it wasn't possible to buy the same frosted pattern) after successfully arguing that the carpet was fully depreciated and therefore of no value!! Anyhow there was an unauthorised tenant who was a drug dealing bikie and we were happy for them to leave without the threat of retaliation (possible if we had demanded compensation)."
Tenants need to understand that old houses are not new houses ... not everything works.
"Ability to have small modifications, such as mounting hooks or TV brackets without penalty but on condition holes are fixed when moving out of premises and that they don't cause any structural issues."
Have a readily enforceable requirement that the landlord responds to maintenance requests within a stipulated timeframe.
Agencies seem to have more power over a tenant if there's any issues
No problem as a tenant.  However as a landlord there are problems especially when dealing with tenants who are behind on rent or for other breaches.  The process of eviction is very difficult.
The lag between bond refunds between moving to one place to the next
"Stabilised rent for at least 2 years at a time. Our rent increases every 6 months, this has made the property unaffordable after 3 years at the property."
it works fine with the balanced entitlement for both the landlord and the tenant
Better communication between tenants and owners for repairs
"Only one?! I had a list! I'll go for environmental issues then. Rubbish isn't managed appallingly. People aren't using recycling bins properly. Property managers constantly have to dig through bins to remove recyclables or plastics. This should be managed in a consistent manner for all high density buildings. Food waste, plastics, batteries, garden waste, electronics etc. Make it easy for those stupid ones among us."
"The quality of the person in charge of managing my property. Or, having better information more easily available. Instantly. I don't want to have to ssend a letter or make a submission I want to either have an online chat, or have a phone call with someone about the issues I'm facing."
Rules geared more towards owners than renters.  At the moment it seems renters have all the advantages
A property be fit for purpose prior to renting
"Properties being properly cleaned and tidied before we move in including lawns mowed, gardens weeded & everything fixed and working and ready to go."
Introduction of long term leases as are inplace in Europe and USA
Some or little communication with the actually owner of the property in the case where the agents may not be doing their job well. Also a little more flexibility to personalise the home.
Tennants should have to sign minimum of 6 months lease 
Allow pets at the property and allow renters to challenge blanket bans on pets by either landlords or bodycorps.
Speedier access for landlords or agents to make inspections and preferably spot inspections
Renting a specific unit in a complex only to arrive and be put where they like to put you although you had rented on the basis of a specific unit. 
restrictions around pets
Ability to have pet of choice
"Communication. The communication between the real estate and the tenant (in my experience) has been appauling. We were 'supposedly' always behind even though we were paying rent on time we would always receive text messages advising of this. I had even called the agent several times about the matter. Then the agency changed the way they receive rental payments which neither of them suited us. Luckily we had made another account specifically for rent as they had not taken rent out for about 4 weeks and there had been a significant amount of money in that account. I had to argue with them to take it. 
We have had them organise house inspections and not turn up nor leave a card. 
I think that house inspections need to be completed whilst the tenant is home and a time that suits them so they can be available. Because I don't know if our house inspections are even being completed. "
"The interactions between tenant and realtor/owner. 
having maintenance can be a pain point to be organised without having to contact the RTA, also the opportunities for Pets really puts us in locations we generally don't want to live, but we will not give up our pets."
Improved follow up of complaints through the RTA. (I had no follow up on potential fraudulent behaviour by my realestate agent previously)
"Some realestate agents will attempt to milk money from tenants, or put them through strange hoops while renting. I feel like the agents rely on tenant ignorance, or lack of time to dispute. Additionally, the current penalties for agents are mostly financial and settled behind closed doors. If realestate organizations were held accountable for their behaviour, on possibly some sort of searchable public database, maybe their behaviour would improve. If for example, you were able to search a particular realestate and view the amount of times they had been fined, or how difficult they were to deal with etc. This may be able to provide some type of accountability."
To ensure more consistency with the laws the govern renting and their use in courts such as QCAT
The tenant should be allowed to replace tired old curtains and blinds to enhance the property at their own cost. The tenant should also be able to add a good quality blind to the window to add privacy from the neighbours. The Agent should not be able to hand the keys over to any tradesperson to carry out repairs without the tenant or Agent being present.
Some Real Estate Agencies are proactive and supportive but some only provide lip service not only to me as a renter but also as a owner. Needs to be more to hold them accountable if they are looking after someone elses property.
"Real estate agents and owners have for too long dominated tenants. This has resulted in artificially high rent prices, impunity in withholding bolds and charging tenants for general wear and tear, denying applications for renters who struggle financially."
Increase in the amount of bond that owner could charge
"1.2	What's one thing you'd change to improve your renting experience?

Reduce the period prior to the end of the lease at which the renewal notice is sent. It is ridiculous for us to receive a renewal notice and a Notice of Intention to Leave FOUR MONTHS before the lease ends, and have the excuse given by the Property Manager as being that they want to get all leases organised before they go on annual leave. This clearly indicates that they do not have another trustworthy person to follow through with tenants when they are not there."
Better support from rta. They never help with tenant owner disputes
Making it easier for responsible tennents to have pets
"To be able to make the house feel more like home without being penalised, and/or withholding of bond at end of tenancy for something that you were not responsible for."
There has to be tighter control on how leasing agencies operate. They constantly bully the uneducated and young (possibly elderly as well) and they do not behave ethically whatsoever. 
"Being able to have a pet.  Finding appropriate accommodation within my budget when I have an indoor dog is very difficult.   Even today I am breaking the terms of my lease by having my dog inside, even though the Agent (and I suspect the Landlord) knows."
"2 Bonds, One for the rent and another for the property condition, the property condition bond gets transferred from rental to rental so they don't need to keep coming up with it. Tenants with pets should also be charged an extra bond. "
"Inspections ONLY whilst tenant present.
Maintenance carried out as per tenants availability, not owners
"
"More accountability and responsibility for real estate agents. If something goes wrong in a rental property they should be having it fixed, particularly safety issues."
I would make it easier for tenants to keep pets and get repairs
Tennant looked after property as I look after my home. 
"have more consistent tenancy occupation
tenants that take a little more care to house and garden"
"Security, we are at our third property in 6 years due to properties being sold & new owners wanting to move in, now our current one has been listed but we have not yet been advised so i imagine we will be notified when our lease is due to expire in approx 4 months. Moving is a very costly endeavour when you are a family & it will be harder this time as we now have a dog."
"More power to tenants.  More professional, maybe better qualified/educated or certified property managers"
"Make it more favourable to the owner. If the tenant is not paying rent, damage property. They should be able to be evicted within 7 days."
"Rental properties need to allow pets. We have a super well behaved Labrador that is highly trained. 
We get rejected on rentals purely based on the fact that we have a dog."
"Property Managers and Real Estates to be held accountable for their actions, particularly with regards to their performance or lack of action."
How you apply to rent a property its a long process with so much pap6
Good tenants do not need 3 monthly inspections!!!!
Make it an easier process to apply for a house
"Allowing renters to have a pet no matter what. If damaged is caused then renter pays for repairs. 
Getting repairs fixed quicker. "
I do not have any problems.  We use an agent to provide for our rental property.
"Property Management Companies are now far to big and a person renting becomes a number. Companies that have different/inexperienced, Property Managers dealing with only one area of Property Management, making it impossible for a tenant to receive the correct service they should be providing. 
To improve my renting experience, only one Property Manager who is experienced and can handle all areas that relate to renting and the the most importantly, they must have very good people skills."
Price and realestate customer service 
"better balance for landlords to protect their investments, better policies to stamp out rental arrears, past tenants who leave the premises owing money being able to be found to pursue court charges against them and more suitable guidelines on times on notices"
Have rules that are fair for both owners and tenants and not be bias towards either party.
"Tenants are all treated as untrustworthy by real estate agents until they read the application form. My partner and I are professionals in our 50s and financially stable but choose to rent. It's not until the agents read the completed application form that they are civil. Then they fall over themselves. Every agent we have dealt with only looks out for the owner, never the tenant.  If the owner breaches the lease, too bad. If the tenant does - even for something very minor - the vitriol from the agents can be extremely distressing.  Something that needs to change in Qld is the ability for more tenanted properties to allow pets. It has been proven that people can suffer extreme mental health issues when their pets have to be given away if an agent (and it's usually the agent, not the landlord) says that pets are not allowed. In our long experience, children do more damage to property than pets. A previous agent threatened to have us removed if we let our small dogs inside, so we went direct to our property owner to ask permission to allow them to live inside. He was perfectly fine with this - the agent hadn't even asked him! The stress this caused was monumental especially as we had just moved here from another city and had nowhere else to go."
"equal termination periods for owners and tenants (e.g. either party give 4, 6 or 8 weeks notice to leave)"
Rent score of/for tenants
"The invasion of privacy, to what I consider to be my home, during 3 monthly inspections. I had one today, the agent wanted to take photos again. She takes a general photo of the rooms, which has all MY belonging in it. I don't see why I have to put away all my family photos etc on a regular basis so that the owner can be satisfied that I'm keeping the place 'nice'. That's what an inspection report is for. The agent can SEE that the property is well kept. I suffer from anxiety and I stress every time I have to go through this. I have been renting for almost 40 yrs, this is the first real estate agent who INSISTS on taking photos of MY things. I'm prepared to move if the owner doesn't like my objection but the agent pointed out that ALL agents are now doing this. It sounds like laziness on behalf of the agents. They used to take photos only of things that needed attention regarding the property but what this agent is doing is not that. Renters in this country are treated very badly compared to many European countries. Australia should have a good look at the way things are done there."
Rentals should always be paid in advance 
Annual check up of smoke detectors could be reduced to once every two years.
"That owners MUST make repairs and maintain the property in good repair at all times. RTA has stronger jurisdiction to enforce same and hefty penalties apply for not meeting their obligations. Renters can withhold rent when necessary repairs are not done within 7 days (i.e. plumbing, electrical, garden, storm damage, hot water and other amenities necessary and critical to maintain satisfactory living conditions). "
Make the notification for vacating for both tenant and Landlord them same i.e 30 days
"As an owner my income is from rents, council rates always increase, rents don't. 
It would be fairer for investors and renters if rents increased each year tied to CPI. "
Make sure housing has the basics without having to constantly ask landlords to incorporate in the house.
"Improve communication between the tenant, the agent, and the owner"
More freedom to treat our house as a home
Lengthy process to remove tenants - being left out of pocket if bond used up as rent
Limit the ability of agents to raise rents at a whim.. In my experience most rent rises happen because the agent thinks it's time for a rise not because the owner actually requested it or that the market reflects it..
"Affordability - when I was left suddenly single last year, finding a decent property to rent that I could afford was almost impossible"
forced to pay rent through third party finance business that we have to pay extra for and they don't pass the money on to real estate in proper time
Clarity around bond repayments at the end of lease.
Tennents being responsible for the damage that they make to properties
I find the currently legislation is very much on the tenants side but it should be equal between owner and tenant. 
More awareness of Real Estate agents and their capacity to doing their job.
Landlord to have more say about who they would like living in their homes and no pets or smoking in their homes if that’s what the landlord wants
Faster bond processing
"More online lodgement, soft copy forms and e-commerce."
Routine inspections to be done by All Real Estates on a regular basis and put it to six months instead of every 3 months.
"Bond claims are difficult, we are PMs  not specialists on the price of doors, or damaged items to replace, yet we cant claim the entire bond under the legislation  whiles we work through this.  "
"I understand and respect that the Landlord needs to be kept aware of how tenants maintain their property, however I do think that 3 monthly inspections are too frequent and that 6 monthly would be more appropriate.  
I also think that good tenants who have a good track record with inspections and perfect rent ledger should not be put in the same box as those tenants who are sloppy with maintaining properties 
Good tenants should be left alone more, and have less frequent inspections as opposed to younger less experienced tenants.
I myself have been renting for close to 20 years."
"RTA should have a 'Black list' of tenants who have caused problems in the past so we landlords can make more informed decisions about who we accept.

Possibly a 'Black list' of landlords as well."
"Better system is needed in  protecting the investor / property owners property, this is a big cost and a risk investing in property and to have tenants from time to time damaging or abusing properties walking away with no recourse. this leaves an investor not wanting to invest in there financial future, by investing in property would pave the way to a better financial retirement and not burdening the welfare system. The QCAT system need to work better with any magistrate issues that  arise pertains to the tenant where they both correspond eg, assault of the property manager while under an eviction notice! QCAT will not take these issues into consideration. 
 "
"Add a consequence when the tenant doesn't pay rent.  In my experience, a tenant can break a lease with no repercussions as the court doesn't have any power to make sure the rent is paid.  Also, we need a system for tenants with bad rental ratings for private landlords.  This will help landlords understand how much management is required with particular tenants."
For landlord not to always try to do repairs on the cheap.
Promotion of longer leases and more ability for Renter's to make changes e.g. being able to secure furniture to the wall. 
I would like to be able to sign open ended leases so I did not have to stress over whether or not I was going to have to move when the 12 month lease expires.
Making tenants more accountable for damage they cause when the bond doesn't cover it.
That th owner does maitnance and not have handyman doing it as a cover up on the real situation. 
Looking at the amount of time given to tenants for breaches.
More accountability for tenants that damage properties.
Increase the amount of the bond held by the RTA.
"I haven't rented for over 35 years, and any grievances I may have had have been rectified by the Residential Tenancies Act"
"Analysing and comparing  weekly rental before accepting tenancy agreement. Since moving in I’ve found each single unit to be cheaper rent than the one I reside in.
"
being able to manage my own power/solar supply 
"Having a universal system for rental applications.
"
Let renter have fair say and balance in controlling lease terms and conditions 
I would ensure that Tenants have a right to exit a contract agreement without penalty if the rental property is placed on the market during their tenancy. 
Hold home owners accountable to houses condition
More accountability on negligent real estate agents
Tighter laws that assist in protecting the owner when property is maliciously damaged by tennants.
pets allowed in more rental properties 
"Reduce the time owners must give to terminate a lease (e.g) one month
INcrease the time renters must give to terminate a lease (eg) one month 
"
Tenant not to put holes in the walls for unnecessary things.  Place is supplied with enough hooks to put pictures up.
The ability to provide input to the management / administration of the residential precinct. Leaseholders/renters are often treated as second class citizens in my experience.
Make real estate agents more accountable for delivering a quality service focused on positive outcomes for all parties. This would hopefully introduce better process and training for staff requiring more investment from estate agents ensuring there is a balanced mix of stakeholders with skin in the game. 
"Sometimes apartment renewals are being pushed to make a decision 2 months out, makes it hard to find another property after saying no"
"The respect and rights given to tenants. A better focus on the experience from a renters perspective, not just the rights of the owner."
Better communication with the owners of the property not just the agency or managementb
"Seems to be too much in favour of the tenant giving an owner no incentive to rent their property, meaning less accommodation available for renters. "
I would prefer rent to be required to be paid weekly or fortnightly not at the discretion of the tenant.
"I'd like it if Agents were more accountable for their actions and were respectful of the tenants. They should treat us like customers not like we are just a major inconvenience to them especially when they are are constantly telling the owners to put the rent up every chance they get no matter how unrealistic it is.

For the next question there should be another option: ""I think the rules about renting in Queensland..."" are in the rental AGENTS favour."
Lower rent and longer notice to vacate.  
Less bureaucracy and legislation
Real estate be more efficient 
Freedom to make a house a home.
"Tenants and property management companies need to be held responsible for damage caused, with greater avenues for compensation for owners when property is destroyed."
Get to know the landlords/real estate before signing a lease
Property management firms need to stop treating rental tenants so poorly. We could not believe how badly we were treated by LJ Hooker property management Cleveland QLD 4163.
"Longer notice periods for both landlord and tenant - ending tenancies, entry to property etc"
Bring in communication education for property managers as I feel that there is a 'I am God' attitude and they speak to tenants as if they are dirt.  I have only came across 2 property managers over 35 years of renting who did not have this attitude.
Better representation for the owner.
"Reintroduce depreciation. If you can depreciate something that’s brand new, why shouldn’t you be able to depreciate 90% of something that’s almost brand new? This also impacts the value of owner-occupied homes after a renovation as they are less valuable to the small portion of the market that are investors. It also means that as an investor, I’m less likely to have modern fitting and fixtures in my next property (as I’ll buy something more dated), so the tenants will be negatively impacted."
"Give better access to premises for vision impaired individuals.
Handrails and or ramps rather than steps.
Handrails in bathrooms and toilets mandantory"
More power to landlords / owners against property managers and bad tenants 
Being able to make a home homely by putting up pictures/artwork etc. and being able to put up new curtains/blinds.
Less rent inflation 
"Having better communication between tenants, property managers and owners, it takes to long to get anything done "
"We recently moved in to new realestate rental property “PROFESSIONALS realestate Mackay”  during our 34th days living in this place and not even finish putting/ organising stuff we received an e-mail that says we are due for the place inspection, shocked us. and the 3 months later another inspection letter/email. Now 5 months living in this place and had inspection twice already which is for me is WRONG where is our rights as a TENANTS? and then recently we received another email that says our rent is going to increase from 270 after November 28,2018 will be up to $290
What to do?"
There is not only one thing. Top of list though is the invasion of privacy of constant entry notices for one thing or another and never ending inspections. The frequency of inspections should be commensurate with the track record and quality of the tenant.
Rules for tenants and owners are not equal. 
Some real estate agents have different expectations on how clean you left rental 
"All properties allowing pets to be kept on the premises, with no penalty of higher rent or decreased availability "
I'd ask that tenants be allowed to have pets regardless of the owner's preference. 
Treatment of tenants by real estate agencies. 
For A1 tenants with long long excellent rental records do 1st year 6 month inspections then 12 monthly inspections. Realise those of us in this situation used to go for 10 years without an inspection and everything was A1 every time 
"3 visits by realestate instead of 4

"
Much tighter and broader regulation around the number of occupants in a property and behavior. I'm absolutely fed up with rental pockets full of students and parties. I would also require landlord to take some kind of social awareness test or training to make them understand how their decision affect people lives. 
Open honest and transparent communication with property management and real estate agencies 
"Being unable to challenge a rent increase then a decrease once notice to move out is given eg
Lease is due for renewal 5% increase in rent, Tennant can't afford the increase so moves out landlord then re rents the property for less than the original pre increase rental figure."
"Not to increase rental costs - especially without any Govt wage increases to match. 
This causes homelessness."
More affordable rental properties near public transport 
"1. To make it compulsory for owners to have secutity screens, window locks and working door locks   installed before they are allowed to lease the property.
2.  Owners should be made to have property/properties inspected by the national rental association (think that's what they're called) and get a certificate of approval to ensure their property is safe and all amenities/ features including garages are deemed livable before being able to list it on the rental market."
QCAT to have ability to overturn Form 12 without grounds by landlord or agent if tennants havent done anything wrong. 
Lessors to have more control over management of tenants
"Tougher laws on renters who don’t pay rent, cleanup & repairs especially & be made accountable for damages including damages done by PETS when vacating. This also includes current rules about giving notice to tenant to vacate - its different for the renter and the property owners, i.e. owners have to allow two months & renters only need to give 2 weeks."
"Fair protections and support for property owners to   recoup money owing from tenants to cover unpaid rent, damage, lost rental income as a result of damage."
Longer Security of Tenure for the Tenant
Availability of affordable and suitable houses.
"More regulation about the delivery of services and professionalism of property managers.   They are generally dishonest to landlords.  eg. don't do regular inspections, give old inspection photos to landlords.    It is more difficult to monitor now without having travel to location as a tax deductible expense."
Owners and property managers don’t seem to have much consideration for tenants - good tenants are hard to find but are still treated like second class citizens 
Applying for rental properties is a difficult task given they prefer fulltime working people but viewing the property is during working hours. 
Landlords to lower the rent prices and fully maintain the property 
Rental management obligations to clearly communicate and respond with both the owner and the tenant 
"More security,  the urge for more properties to have security screens. More privacy in own home. "
More communication between all parties involved. 
Longer lease terms
Landlords have little to no say about how they manage their property
The process of non paying tenants 
Real estate and owner fixing housing issues before tenants move in. Still waiting for our fly screens and air conditioner to be repaired and we moved into the house in May
I would like to be able to personalise my unit by having pictures on the wall and have my dogs with me 
Owners to do regular maintenance 
The ability to make tenants pay their rent on time and an easier recourse to recoup money owed when they debunk
"Real Estate Agencies and property owners are using the Fixed Term Contract to make it impossible to leave a property at any given stage. For the 1st year a Fixed Term Contract is acceptable, but after a year the contract should go into a periodic contract automatically. Many tenants are required to break their leases and going through very stressfull and financial pain when they are required to move to another location."
Improved ways to communicate things that need to be fixed or other requests. Many times it's felt like we would be persecuted for requesting something.
"More support for tenants who are bullied by real estate, quality of life at rental, ability to have pets "
Better checks before people rent my property
Putting pictures on the wall. 
"The RTA does not work as it was intended, it does not resolve any disputes as it is supposed to, it simply directs any dispute to QCAT"
"More Information available to renters, "
Some renters attitudes when availing themselves of other peoples hard earned property.
"Make sure tenants are treated with respect. At the moment we are often dictated to by the whims of agents and landlords. We have no ability to negotiate times for routine inspections or maintenance. We are often asked to leave through no fault of our own, such as when the landlord wants the property back or the property sells. It seems we have to ask permission to do anything. We have to wait for maintenance to be taken care of because the agent won't pass it on to the landlord or the landlord can't afford it. Short-term leases (no more than 12 months) make it hard to plan our lives and feel like we live in a home. Agents treat us like we are all going to turn bad and damage the home. Routine inspections are too frequent. The list goes on but you get the idea. "
"According to the RSPCA, 62% of Australian families own pets and yet the majority of rental properties do not allow pets."
For the landlord to fixes thing when needed
If the owner of the property makes the decision to sell the house and you have to move out there will be no clean up fee for the renter like carpet cleaning exc  
"Laws to allow tenants to be held accountable for rent not paid , there should be criminal charges as it is a form of thief. "
More control as a tenant. More opportunity for improvement 
More pet friendly places and still reasonable price. 
Maintenance actually takes place. If you are paying for the extras then they should work.
less government intervention
Consistency with the guidance given from RTA advisers/conciliators 
" It would be nice to feel more secure when the lease is coming up, you always question if you will have to find a new home. Also as my husband and I are young we often feel forgotten by the property management when it comes to their duties of maintaining the property. "
I would like to see Property Managers held a lot more accountable for their actions around bond returns. They use the threat of a non refund as a cover for their lack management/maintenance during the tenancy and blackmail tenants 
The way in which energy costs are handled. I strongly believe that all homes should be solar run and I find it disappointing that water pumps attached to water tanks are not repaired or maintained due to the belief that those costs don't compare to the cost of the electricity used to pump the water from the tank
"More accountability by the Property Manager in reporting tenant issues before they become an issue. 
My past (not current) experience saw my property being wrecked and rent way behind and I wasn't advised until I changed Real Estate management. 
Routine inspection photos should be dated."
Free or cheap blacklisting 
I wouldn’t rent a property if I had a choice. 
"I would like to see tenants not having to pay for all of their water. We should only have to pay for any excess over the council allowance as it used to be. The way it is now makes us not want to take care of the yards, gardens etc. as if we water them we have to pay a hefty fee which doesn't seem fair when you already pay exhorbitant rent"
"I feel there are too many grey areas in the legislation when it comes to QCAT and the outcome on the day ultimately comes down to the adjudicators interpretation on the day. There really should be one set of rules for everyone. I feel to ensure more consistent and fair results that QCAT should be with adjudicators only, not JP's. I've seen too many innocent people get ruled against which really is heartbreaking for the clients.

Also, when talking to the RTA. I could talk to 3 different people in the same day about the same issue and get 3 different answers from them. There needs to be more consistency."
Stricter rules on checking equipment & appliances upon exiting before bond is paid back
Improve the quality of property managers by regulating a minimum education standard.
nothing comes to mind 
Leave everything the way it is.
So far experience has been reasonable
More ability to get rid of bad tenants that damage property and more ability to take more bond if places are purposely not looked after.
The ability for people to enter your home without you present.
More rentals to allow pets without having to pay over $50 extra a week.
"Availability of properties, a price reduction of renting properties more suited for low-income students and young people"
More onus on agents and owners to prove cleaning of premises prior to moving in and more flexibility to add small things such as picture hooks etc. We have rented for 5 years and the owner will not allow 6 small mechanical hooks similar to what she already has in the property.
Giving the renter a bit of flexibility if they have to break lease due to work transferring
The amount you have to pay to move in somewhere it's hard to pay 2 weeks rent and 4 weeks bond when you have to pay all the other moving costs 
"No need for rental inspections every 3 months. Every 6 months is fine if you are an excellent tenant with excellent rental history. Also, there is a constant lack of notification when tradespeople are entering the house/premises etc. Generally tenants are made to feel like the scum of the earth even if they are excellent tenants with excellent rental history and professional jobs. "
Greater flexibility to end lease by both Landlord and Tenant in certain circumstances. 
longer leases.  Security of not having to risk finding a new home every year.
"have face to face applications  , to many variables with online , apps dont work etc ,"
"i am a landlord .
i am filling this out as suggested by our property manager as apparently 76 % has been done by Renters.
so if i feel a question is not applicable i will type N/a or give a neutral response if that is an option .
like so far the questions seem to apply to renters ."
"more freedom to do stuff, like put pictures up. build gardens and have pets."
"Stricter maintenance policies for owners, and prevention of intimidating practices on tenants by Real Estates . "
Better screening of tenants 
"'Mandated options in lease length:

Short term lease:
- 6 month
- 12 months

Longer term leases:
- 24, 36, 48 or 60 months

These longer term leases should also be at a set rent with NO rental increases allowed. The hardest part of renting is some landlords (and estate agents) ramp the rent up every year which eventually makes renting a particular place too expensive. This only serves to push renters further and further into the outer suburbs where there are less rental properties and greater commute times to business centers. "
Equal notice periods between tenants and landlords - 30 days either way is fair for both parties
More respect for the owners renting the property to the tenant. 
"Renters are sick of being treated as second class citizens. We pay the full price as per lease contracts, and always on time.  We take care of the property as if it were our own, take responsibility for any damages we (potentially may) cause, hold respect for the place we live, and try to make it our home. 
We are paying customers and should be treated as such with a full provision of services for our custom. In my experience, this is not - and has never - been the case. Investors would not be able to make profit without 1) renters, and 2) keeping the property in rentable condition. 
The standards in some cases have been appalling, where we have been made to feel unimportant, maintenance issues not prioritised (even when they are major issues such as plumbing, loss of an oven for an unreasonable amount of time, or when a major safety issue was reported to the RTA), tenants are not seen as stakeholders and therefore are never updated with key information (even something as simple as 'you now have a new real estate agent, who's name is X - please refer to this person from now on'). It is like extracting blood out of stone to get information from real estate agencies, whose clear agenda is selling properties, and renting treated as less, or secondary. Reasons for second class treatment has included: miscommunication due to short staffing, or simply ""miscommunication"", or 'inability to contact the owner', or no explanation given at all. We the tenants put up with this level of treatment (or lack thereof) due to legislation, lack of choice (due to financial or renting availability), and lack of monitoring or enforcement of tenant rights until the tenant formalises a complaint. In short, we have been made to feel as if the owner is more important than we are, that we have no stake or say in our rights as renters, that the real estate would rather keep the owner happy to keep their business, as if tenants are disposable, and that if we make a complaint formal we may not have our lease renewed.  This is not acceptable. Tenants should have the right to treat their house as a home, as they (we) are paying for the accommodation as a service. The coin flips both ways - we tenants are more than happy to treat the rental as if it was our own, respecting the property, reporting maintenance, keeping it clean and tidy, take responsibility for damages, and so on. In return, we expect to be treated like the paying customers we are, which includes: on time maintenance (within whatever is deemed a reasonable service for each individual maintenance request), reasonably timely response to emails from the real estate agency (we are sick of being ignored because of 'staffing issues'), legitimate acknowledgment of when an information request is made, realistic management of lease renewals (granting lease renewals 6 months in arrears due to 'overstaffing' is not acceptable), more freedom to make the house a home (such as putting up curtains or wall hangings), and very importantly the right to have a pet.  
According to the ABS 2016 census, less homes are owned outright, with renting on the rise (in comparison to 1991). 
http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Snapshot%20of%20Australia,%202016~2
All Australians should be able to live in home, not a house. Being able to take liberties to transform a house into a home, is uniquely individual. This can be done in a respectful manner. Having to live in fear of exorbitant rental increases, or nonrenewal of a lease removes stability from a renter's lifestyle. Being able to own a pet by choice should be the privilege of all Australians, no matter housing status.  Shelters will not allow a renter to rescue an animal without express approval from the landlord/real estate, or proof of home ownership. Since the majority of rentals do not allow pets, this financial elitism is a way of excluding renters from living a life they choose, and excluding renters from adopting a pet and saving a life from a shelter. This is not what I call being Australian, the land of the 'fair go' for all. I am deeply disappointed and appalled at the treatment my family has had as a renter.  It appears under the current housing circumstances do indeed favour the upper class, and treat renters as second class."
Better checks of tenants
"Increase rights of landlord /agents
Increase bonds in low value rentals and for pets"
i would of not have stoped my rent due to my mother being in ICU for a month. in Ipswich as I was living in Rockhampton. 
"Lower interest rates or better tax offsets for property owners.
Interest rates go up, cost of living goes up - my wage and my tenants income don't increase, it's not fair to ask for more rent and it's not fair that It is costing me more every year to own and run a rental property"
Need property managers to be more critical of the rents care of my house
More bond to be paid to owners for damage. 
The system is swayed to protect a tenant & yet without investers they wouldn't have a place to live.
As a landlord to have a say in animals I deem suitable to my property and to be able to terminate rental agreement is tenant in breach 
Better provisions in the legislation to help property managers protect tenants who are victims of domestic violence. 
repairs getting done
More rights for the home owner after all they spent the money to purchase the property 
Prefer to have less inspections during the tenancy.
"More freedom to make the house feel like a home.

"
"Less inspections, especially when proven good track record"
Have property managers that could communicate better
"I am not a renter, however a Property Manager although I do hear complaints regarding rude Agents within this area from a lot of potential renters who I come across."
Tenant accountability for damages and lost rent
"Tennants changing their own lightbulbs and tap washers.  Tending to simple, basic requirements that come with living in a house. "
Make real estate personnel responsible for their actions without having to drag them through expensive court actions
People's integrity and responsibility
"Agents held to account for the work that they are paid to do.  I have had agents do works that I have not given them permission to approve, take the money and then say 'sorry.'  They have also don't ensure proper cleaning of the flat.  I have had managers charge $800 for a bond clean and there is grease on the stove and inside the oven is dirty (130m2 3 bed flat).  "
Fairer property managers 
"People don't care about someone else's property and not paying for damages.
Most of them are behind in rents, abandon the property and leaving a huge mess behind. Some people Trash the place as well. 
Cats and dogs rip all flyscreens and the frames are tossed away by the tenants.
Yards are never cleaned up."
"Having to wait for an owner to fix maintenance. Having to allow inspections to re rent the house, owners expecting tenants to complete maintenance which is not their responsibility. Not being able to get the same answer from the rta regarding an issue. You call up once and get one answer call up again 10 mins later and get another answer. No source of truth to rely on as it's not consistent "
Strong legislation making pets (f all shapes and sizes) welcome in all rentals. Body corporate should NOT have jurisdiction to exclude tenants with pets.
No parking available when renting cbd
Currently takes too long to evict troublesome tenants
Greater consideration for tenant 
Have tenants be more responsible for fixing up damage in yards if they have a dog
Houses constantly going up for sale whilst renting them
allow minor alterations to properties such as picture hooks
Reduce ownership costs to allow more sustainable rent
Owners being made to make repairs quicker
"More rights for owners 
Include photos as a part of the hand over from other agencies"
Clarity on minimum housing standards
"Tenants subletting rooms without telling you, causing a lot of wear and tear throughout the house."
The ease by which landlords and real estate agents can control tenants and dismiss their opinions and views without any real or meaningful ability to challenge. 
Building reports become compulsory as their is to many properties that are not up to standard and accidents waiting to happen.  Maybe these reports can be renewed every 3 to 5 years.   
Pets allow with permission 
Damage done to rentals appears to be the responsibility of the owner rather than the tenant. Rents have to be very high to cover costs.
"As a tenant, I would like to be allowed to break my lease without paying compensation or paying the rent until the end of the agreement, as long as I give my Notice of intention to leave with enough notice (like 2 months notice for instance)."
More balance for owners of investment properties
Ensure that the current laws in place remain as they are.  They give protection to both tenants and landlords at present as they are.
Better tenant education 
Allow things to be judged on a case by case scenario.
More pet friendly properties
As a landlord it is hard to remove a problem tenant
Ability to claw back costs from tennants
"I am a early landlord, it is a bit to soon to comment."
I must continue to have input into who can and cant rent my property . I have worked hard for it and it must memy choice
"At the time you rent a property, it has been advertised with specifics eg. 3 x air conditioners. When one of these breaks and cannot be fixed it should be the owners responsibility to replace this but in our experience the owner has just said no they wont be replacing it and the real estate advise this to be the case. This should not be allowed as they are selling/advertising this as part of the price yet the consumer isn't getting it."
"1. This would be not having to have approval for a Pet or Person that visits your house frequently. Currently, I have my mother dogs occasionally visit and friends that stay over and I’ve been told by my real estate I need to have these things approved by the owner, these people and the dog do not reside at the property and I have approval for my own dog already.

2. I don’t believe people should be able to come through your house and view the property anywhere before 7 days of living in a property. For example I recently signed a Form 13 stating we were leaving in three months and the real estate wants to bring viewing tenants through my property with my personal belongings three months before I even vacate, so constant flows of people are coming through my home which is unacceptable when I pay rent to live here."
To be respected and valued by property managers.
make the tenant more accountabile and start a bad tennant registration
Tenants can to easily take advantage
"More fair rules for both the Property Managers and Property Owners.
The rules are already to much in favor of the tenant. "
Less frequent inspections for good tenants
Owner should have more say in being able to evict tenants quickly  for not looking after property or not paying rent on time.
Maintain control of my Assets
to easy for renters to not pay and takes to long to evict and they suffer nothing
I think it unfair my realtor requires me to use a third party to pay the rent and I have to pay for doing it. 
Increase bond from 4-6weeks rent
Improved property protection for property owners against wilful damage caused by tenants.
Feedback from Rental agency when requests put forward in a timely manner.
get better tanants
"Lower rents, better houses, some are terrible for why they charge. Easier application/viewing process. You get a 10 min appt a week on Tuesday, then half the world turn up. So hard for family’s with children, I have personally been in homes in my job where it is just a couple no kids and they’re a disgrace, even property managers homes. Crooked Real Estates that damage things to get you to pay when you leave, had this done personally. Waste of time going to the tribunal as told it would cost me more than paying up."
"More freedom to treat house as a home eg hanging puctures, curtains etc without needing permission. "
Inspection reports done together with agent no matter what tennant notes on report.
"The regulations on pets. So many peoples have pets in Australia. However, no matter the size of the animal (small, medium, large) or the animals' age, pet owners are simply refused by so many rental owners purely because they own an animal. I used to be able to foster care for older dogs who couldn't get adopted - I can't provide that deeply needed care and help anymore. I have no issues with restrictions on size, or on rules about 'no animals inside because of the hardwood floors'. I think there needs to be a base for discussion and appraisal of the animal and owner before immediate applicant dismissal ."
"Bond sufficient enough to cover damages due to picture hanging, not just patching up the hole or peeled off paint on the wall which leaves patches of paint mismatch. Bond costs enough to paint the entire wall. Permission to hang pictures should depend on the duration of tenancy. Does not justify holes punched in walls each year in different places by different tenants if such rights are granted to them. Also a limit on the number of pictures hung off walls. My tenant who is on a 6 month lease with no guarantee they will renew their lease, wants to hang 16 pics throughout the entire house, half of them through proper hooks and the remainder through commando hooks. The initial 6 month lease for a new tenant should stay in place so that the landlords can judge their financial capabilities, their respect for neighbours and behaviour of the tenant towards upkeep of the house. Some sort of a pet bond if pets are allowed as cats especially tend to ruin carpets"
That pets should be more readily approved and not blanked blocked
"3rd party payment options by a Property Manager can change mid stream in a tenancy.  This means if you sign a contract to pay on a friday, the new property manager (if sold - it can pass over to another) - the new person can demand to be paid on a wednesday due to 3rd party payment operational requirements.  This may not line up with tenants banking arrangements or pay cycles.  "
Lower the Bond money.
Property owners have more control over their properties. The laws at present are more favourable to the tenant.
Have the right to say no pets
As a home owner we feel as though the tenants have more rights currently without the suggested new reforms. This questionnaire is already bias towards the tenants and we are at question 1.2.
"As moving costs are so high I'd like to see 12 months minimum lease offered unless by special arrangement and agreed to by both parties. 
I would also like to see the allowance of a pet even if a small addition to the bond is charged.  I realize that many people believe that animals cause damage to properties but from my experience animals cause a lot less damage (if any), than children do.  Besides,  the bond is there to allay any fears that owners may have in regards to any damage that may occur and any concerns and people who allow their animals to damage a property won't care for the property in general. 
I would also like to see repairs done in a timely manner, preferably mandated, and there be some group to oversee this so that the decision isn't just left up to the will of the property owner.   "
"The same opportunities for cheap rentals for people with disabilities as students are given either furnished or unfurnished. Particularly, those registered with NRAS with high priority assessment given on the Government Social Housing registrar."
"Tenants being obligated to sign a lease, not just able to be on month by month extension"
"Limit rent increases to CPI (where other improvements etc do not occur, of course)"
That there is no consequence/penalty when advising that there is maintenance to be done
"Owners that care about their properties and the standard that their properties have to be at and how and when things need to be fixed. 
The price if rentals is too much. "
Making it easier to find pet friendly rentals
A bond for owners that tenants can access. Most owners do the bare minimum in repairs. 
As a landlord I feel that I am limited to what action I can take against a bad tenant - we recently had a tenant leave our property with over $1000.00 in repairs above the bond - she was given 2 wks to respond to a letter of demand to PIF or enter a payment arrangement - 4 wks later she was placed on the TICA register she has now agreed to pay $60.00 f.n of the debt
"Bonds are to low to cover the eviction process when tenants refuse to pay rent, but also refuse to leave. And damage properties "
Have it more equal between tenants landlords 
Easier vacates and trf of bonds
A more balanced legislation between landlord and tenants
Lower fees n charges
"Property managers ignore requests for repairs. For example electrical burning smell from Cooking hob took months before it was resolved.This could have been far more serious and should have been investigated immediately. 
Tenants requests need to be taken seriously and not just brushed aside.
Property managers need to be held accountable for not carrying out repairs within a reasonable time frame. "
Less regular inspections for tenants that have been renting the same place without any issues for more than a year. Once every 3 months is too much.
No discrimination of Single income earners and parents.
Tenants receiving welfare payments should have rent payments deducted before they receive the balance to ensure rent is paid on time.
properity owners should always be able to chose who they want in their houses
Stricter laws in regards to how real estate agents operate.
Greater security of tenure with removal of all provisions for notice to leave without a reason given.
Stop landlords from delaying and/or holding back bonds for completely spurious reasons. We were thankfully saved by a gent from the R.T.A. 
give more power to landlords
"Tenant's choice of contractors for use in maintenance (electrician, air con servicing, etc.) - as long as they're fully licences and if the tenant agrees to pay the difference between the land lord's preferred supplier and the tenant's preferred supplier (i.e. if I want to use *my* fully licenced sparky, not the land lords preferred licenced sparky, but my guy is $10 more, I should be able to - as long as I pay the extra $10). Rules preventing land lords from preventing tenants being able to hang up a reasonable amount of artwork if done correctly."
"We have two fully self contained properties available for rent. Prior to handing over our properties for rental everything have been cleaned from top to bottom, inside and out including lighting, electrical points and electrical white goods. Bonds should be increased to represent the value of the property and contents. Bonds are inadequate and do not cover the of of rent when one has to repair holes in walls and repaint the interior, lay new carpet (hole burnt in it), repair dining chairs and skirting boards (tenants went out and got a puppy which was left inside to urinate, bark incessantly and destroy things * no approval was sought of the landlord),  purchase a new range hood which they broke, replace a light fitting (it could to be located) and purchase two (2) mattresses (waterproof which was supplied was not used).  Our property was without a tenant for 15 weeks while we organised tradespersons to repair the damage. Our experiences last year left us out of pocket by $1000’s of dollars. Tenants should be made to reinstate the property as they received it with like for like and not source goods from Opportunity shops when they break things.   QCat is weighted against the landlord. I ask how can tenants go to QCat and cry poor when the spouse works in the mining industry? "
"A requirement for all new properties to be built with much greater levels of sound proofing than are currently legislated, especially apartments"
Cataloguing of added plants & trees to the gardens 
Tenant to cover costs of all relevant maintenance expenses 
Stronger controls on bad tenents 
More accountability of by some property managers
Private rentals aren’t easily accessible- nor applicants treated fairly 
"Having the ability o make minor changes to a property, or commence repairs after causing minor damage, would make renting a better experience."
There's not enough responsibility on the owner to fix things.  I feel like I'm not entitled to ask.
"More respect for good tenants space and privacy, more consistent rental expectations."
I would live closer to the rental property in order to be able to personally check on it intermittently.
Reduce the rental price. It’s absurdly expensive.
No changes (10 years since rented)
Longer timeframes for entry. 
Better property management
Easier to get your bond back
Notice to leave without grounds. Why must I pay rent till the date I must leave by? If I can give notice of a date I can leave prior that date ( in my case a month prior) why must I continue to pay rent on two properties? This is not by my choice that I have to leave but the landlord recieves rent even though they have terminated!
Allowing for small pets and general wear and tear..
Property managers who are only working for the owners. 
"The way the rental industry, real estates and especially the property managers are trained and treat everyone, often uneducated in how to deal with people in a respectful and understanding way. Every one is treated the same and not taken on face value, they lie and play deceiving tricks, usually in the 11th hour so it is too late for you to be in a position to do anything about it, we all seem to get treated the same, like their worsted ever tenant?"
I have a great tenant and have only been a property owner in QLD for 8 months so my experience so far has been good.
"Estate agent trying to rip us off when moving out for cleaning.

Property was filthy when we moved in and they tried to charge us for extra cleaning when we moved out.

We documented state of property when we moved in so we were fine but they tried. "
"1. Any trees or palms on a property that are in place before the tenancy begins becomes the landlord's responsibilities.
2. Any fences in place must be repaired by the landlord immediately should they be damaged by a storm / cyclone / falling trees.
3. If rents were kept down, then the tenant could make a reasonable contribution to the cost of repairs. 
4. Ensure close living neighbours i.e. in units / duplexes keep their noise to an absolute minimum level with regard to music etc so that the enjoyment and peace of mind for tenants is in place. What this is about is playing duf-duf music and the tenant can hear their own TV."
Maintance and annual services (eg air-conditioning system needs  annual service) being completed when required.
Better communication from the realestate
Tenants pay pet bonds. 
More accountability for real estates to help prevent them exploiting and bullying young renters
Landlords should be compelled to regularly maintain their property
"More affordable renting options. Real estates not abusing renters rights by ignoring repairs, lying to renters or not providing clean properties at the beginning of a tenancy."
"As a tenant, we have been very happy with our experience and wouldn't change anything."
More timely repairs. Being able to contact agents often phones just ring out. Being able to ask for repairs or complain without fear of eviction. 
Have common sense rules that take into account the rights off both Tenants & Landlords
There should be quicker procedures for lessors to take action against rent arrears and property damage. There should be a requirement to allow reasonable timeframes for repairs based on the availability of tradespeople and involvement of body corp or council.
More Public housing to create stability
More rights as a landlord/owner. I feel I had no rights on my own land.
Have rented same address for 4 years I am a good tenant but hate quarterly inspections!
The owners right to not renew your lease without a reason or allowing the tenant the opportunity to state their case.
"Be allowed to hang our framed pictures.
Have the option to have a pet (responsibly cared for) "
Having a legal lease/agreement between housemates in a bid to keep disputes between housemates to a minimum.
More variety of choices. Not just estate houses packed in like sardines. We require a shed and a large backyard which narrows our options significantly
Clearer guidelines as to what is a repair and what is an improvement at the tenant's request 
"Less inspections for longer term renters who have a record of paying on time and keeping the property maintained and clean. 
"
Make it easier for persons of low income to obtain a rental property.
Being able to contact my agent and actually understanding who they are.
Being able to have pets without having to request permission/have restrictions as to whether the pet can be inside the hours. 
Less inspections and photos being taken
"Improve the way Property Managers carry out their 3 monthly checks.  Some are not thorough enough.  The outside of the property is as important as the inside, both require regular maintenance.  Property Managers are not strict enough on how their tenants behave and the impact that behaviour has on neighbours.  I found Property Managers rude!"
"The idea that you need to give notice of 60 days as a landlord but only 14 days as a tenant is wrong, and is being abused."
Nothing. I am a property owner and my property manager handles things very well. 
"Longer tenancy agreements, than six months or twelve months....give tax incentives to landlords who lease for five to ten years.....so initially 12 months so landlord determines you care for the house and can pay the rent, then five year leases plus with tax bonus for longer leases....my daughter is not well....she has bad asthma and is on oxygen at home....and I have had a large cancer op....but after a year at our last rents the house was sold and we had to move....and we didn't have four weeks rent for bond and two weeks in advance and had to borrow it."
"The real estate needs to be acting/ working for both tenant and landlord. 
The agent should issue remedy breaches to tenants and landlords. 
The expectations on tenants to represent themselves is entirely unfair. "
"Tenants should be required to leave the property in the same condition they received it in, if the carpets were professionally steam cleaned upon the start of the tenancy,  the tenant should be required to also do this upon vacating.
If tenants are allowed a pet while living in the property they should be required to have the property professionally treated for fleas when they vacate.  Fleas are not evident immediately, it is the eggs left behind that hatch some days or weeks are the pets have been removed."
"There should be more support for land lords when dealing with problem tenants. The biggest issue is trying to deal with tenants who breach constantly and there is little that can be done to have them removed without going through a long winded legal process that still favours the tenant. If you want to entice investors then you need to provide better assistance for them.
I had an issue with a tenant who was constantly breaching for non-payment of rent and the property manager was not interested in helping to resolve the issue and actually ended up terminating our contract with them leaving us trying to find someone to take over while dealing with a problem tenant."
The property manager and how long they take to action requests
Prompt response from agent when there are issues. Fair rent rises. 
To be treated with more trust and consultation 
Real pictures of the properties that we are searching for. Real-estate staff who treat you better and not as if we are trash. Real-estate questions that concern the renting not my private life. Owners to keep up the maintenance of the properties.
Consistent and competent property managers
The balance has tipped too far in the tenants favor. To keep landlords in the market who are doing the right thing they need to be given more rights about their property. It is after all THEIR property.
Allow tenants to hang pictures and make the property feel like a home 
Greater regulation of agents. Enforcement of breaches made by agents. Time limits put on owners to respond to enquires by agents. 
Landlords should have to spend up to $1000 every year on up grades when no repairs are needed to the property for good tenants.
Pets allowed as default
A landlord who will fix problems without blame
"For there to be less difficulty finding a property that will accept a pet, particularly when the pet is proven to not have caused any damage in previous properties."
Better clarity of the Act and stricter penalties for tenants who default 
Arrogant real estates and landlords who think of tenants as second class citizens who should just shut up and pay rent.
Address how neighbours can impact your amenity
"Reduce the amount of inspections allowed by rental companies.  
Allow pets in rentals.
"
Carpet laws and flee sprays need to be done after every vacate
"More support for both owners and tenants. Better options for if either party are not happy with service provided (not provided) by real estate. Better communication between owner/real estate/tenant.
The best thing that ever happened to me was being able to rent privately. I've always been treated much better by the owners and gotten issue resolved much quicker than by real estates."
for agents to be able to over ride an owners authority when it comes to doing repairs
"Property Managers have too many properties to manage, a change on customer service, prompt repairs, follow up would make all the difference for many tenants.

Owners of real estates that have not been a property manager give the PMs 150+ properties some managing upto 350 on their own."
Unfair bond claims
"As a landlord, I feel that a Residential Lease is worthless. 
If a tenant signs up for a lease and then they want to break the lease, they can do so easily just by claiming ""financial hardship"". We've have that happen to us 3-4 times.
 In a commercial lease, a solicitor will at least advise the client that the Lease term is enforceable.
"
Tighter regulations for realestate and landlords. 
"A recommended rent amount based on the area, the home and features of the property.  While not binding in any way, it would allow renters to compare the asking price against the recommended.

Nothing time consuming, but a scale starting with location, type of property, then features - number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of toilets, shed, pool, large yard, animals allowed."
"My current real estate's attitude (which includes verbal abuse), lack of knowledge with laws/processes and continual ignorance when it comes to responding to emails."
That all properties where pet friendly tentants shouldnt be crusified for havibg kids and pets
The state of rentals in this area is poor.  I have never moved into one that didn't need a lot of cleaning.  Hard to make your place comfortable when you can't hang up pictures etc.
"The RTA is very supportive but they don't actually have the power to defend you when you are threatened by your property manager - emotionally and physically.  Also when the property manager lies about you, they commiserate but they cannot help.  "
Longer lease agreements
"Tenant should be notified prior to signing a lease agreement if the neighbour is about to start renovating.

Also, currently a landlord is able to sell the property after 3months of the lease agreement commencing and the tenant has no rights - re: free release from a 12 month lease. Real estate agents can then give as little as 24 hours notice to show potential buyers through.

Also, the land lord has refused to replace faulty items in the property and property manager has done nothing to resolve this."
The parameters for consideration of fair wear and tear on a rental property. 
"Make the tenants more responsible for how they look after houses when they rent them from another person. 
They must be made to take care of properties they rent."
Seek best deals in rental properties but remain with same agent.
Easier more connected application process 
Better maintained housing that's less expensive.
Every place should allow pets. You should be able to hang things on the wall and park on the grass if necessary. The landlord and property manager should not be able to tell you what to do in your own house when you’re paying to live there.
"Give tenants less rights, and owners/managers more rights."
The attitude of managing agents toward renters. Managing agents seem to see renters as an inconvenience and some project a belief that renters are a lesser class of people.
More rental properties accepting pets.
Easier re-imbursement of damage caused by tenants.
More rights for the tenants and listen to their problems 
To introduce a longer written notice period by the tenant to the owner/agent of their intentions to vacate the property.
As a tenant it can be hard to get traction if you have a complaint to make to the body corporate. I have found that it takes a landlord to complain to the body corporate to get any response.
Real estate agent accountability
be able to make the house more your own during the tenancy
Remove the option for rental property owners to refuse a lease renewal without grounds.
"House inspections should be a done no more than twice a year. More notice than seven days should be required for the house inspection- at least four weeks. If the tenant can't attend, then a suitable time that's agreeable to BOTH parties should be renegotiated. "
Score cards/public reviews of property managers and fairer/simpler compensation for owners as the result of destructive tenants. (Please note that we have recently changed our property manager to a more professional company so our comments can reflect both past and present experiences which are like chalk and cheese.)
"Nothing, we were extremely happy with our property manager."
"As a landlord, I'm so disappointed about the renting coz it's very very low compare before 5-7 years ago then the council rates is very high it is 3x higher in NSW"
The ability for landlords to increase rent every time the lease is extended
consideration of safety for tenants e.g. security on windows
Fairer interchange with property managers. My current real estate has a property manager who presents as a bully. 
Making tenants responsible for damage.
Ensure notice periods are the same for Landlords and tenants so that it is more balanced eg one month's notice on a notice of intention to leave and a notice to leave without grounds 
As a landlord - better communication from the Real Estate managing the property. A better focus on the fact that I own the property not the tenant.
"As an owner, I would like the tenant to be more proactive in advising any general maintenance issues that may arise to the real estate agent so that I can have the jobs actioned eg clearing gutters"
Have a lower rate for longer term contracts
Property owners should have more say in who can rent their property.
"Tenants to abide by the ""no pets"" condition in tenancy agreement."
"property maintenance reviews, must be completed. rental homes must be repaired ASAP."
"There should be a penalty for late rent payment - just like any payment due to government agencies or suppliers like telcos and electricity, there is a penalty for late payment."
Being able to decorate with neutral colors
Independent body checks a house for Health and safety issues after each tenancy. 
"I have more than one - 1) Specific time frames for landlords to action urgent and non-urgent repairs, 2) Specific and strict standards that rental properties must be maintained in order to rent out, 3) Shorter time frames to evict tenants with multiple breaches, 4) Higher bond payment amounts to cover cleaning, repairs etc after tenants have vacated - There are a lot more but can't cover them all at this time."
The amount of occurances when I have to move due to the house being sold
If your rental is to be pet friendly it should be allowed inside too.
"Being able to have a pet, more flexibility for long term renters"
1. Our rights as a landlord to better protect us and our property against bad tenants. 2. The time it take to remove such tenants and the exposure to further loss/damage. 3. The ability to gain assistance to pursue/collect any costs awarded against such tenants via the Tribunal.
Maintenance upkeep by owners
Not having to go to the RTA to get my bond & over paid rent from real estate
I have only rented once through my husbands job and had no problems. 
Tenants to be more accountable for their actions and easier access for private rentals to access renting history.    Most real estates who have managed our property did not pass on information and in one instance were not aware that the tenants had left six weeks previously
"Make it compulsory for each rental property to include a renters review/feedback page as part of the real estate or landlord listing. A compulsory review/feedback page would allow renters to provide their honest feedback on their experience renting a property. It would be available only when the property came up for rent.  For instance, I rented a property where the kitchen flooded when it rained. It was obviously an ongoing issue and one that if I had known about I could have considered during my rental search. "
Requiring a third party confirmation that all rooms offered for rent fulfil renting criteria.
Don't know when I can say no to requests from tenants.
Allowing tenets to have pets 
"If your housemates are violent, or the property has room mates who risk your personal safety, or a dangerous neighbour, you have a right to leave a lease for safety purposes. Safety should be priority. People think they can act however they like, and not be responsible. Ensuring this means you are released from financial obligation due to others actions, and is imperative. This would also ensure owners take more responsibility in whom they rent a property to. Or, how their neighbours act to their tenants. Safety first, then money as a priority. "
Implement rent control so the owners can’t put the price up every 6-12 months 
Allowing pets in all rental properties.
Ensure owners and Re ask Estate agents are accountable for repairs  and continued maintenance of all properties
"Allow tenants to have ""low maintenance clean"" pets ie cats, caged birds, fish."
Increased communication from property managers. 
Real estate agent
More scrutiny with the managing agents. ie Real Estate agents.
I need to have the say as to what happens with my rental property 
Affordable rental prices in Brisbane.
To continue to make our own decision as to whether we wish to have animals in our property or not.
"Dishonest agents hiding damages to property, not mentioning them in their report. Another thing is that they do not have to accept paying rent through my bank which is free, they can force me paying through a financial institution like DEFT,which charges an additional fee."
Notice of intent to sell rental
"Rental prices. How they work out a rental increase and also how often they increase the rent.
"
"If multiple breaches are made for the same thing, even if rectified the landlords should be able seek for this to be a viable reason to evict. (Notice to remedy breach - rent arrears - every month)"
Affordable rent & choice for single people with pets 
Tenants should be responsible for water charges. Landlord should just be required to ensure premises meets min efficiency rating. 
Professional management in a dedicated rental building.
The feeling of unwelcomeness. It feels like all we’re here to do is pay someone elses debt. 
Renters can have a black mark made against their name however rental agencies and real estates can not. Both Landlords and Renters should be able to make a complaint against a real estate agent/agencies in the same way a renter can be blacklisted!
"tenants are spoiled by RTA ruling, as a tenant cannot ask for more"
More equal rights between tenants and landlords 
Limit rent increases to CPI
The competency of property managers. 
"Price increases without any modifications to home (eg. our rent has gone up $15 in 3yrs and we do not have a garden shed, are not allowed to park on the grass we pay for, and have not had the back step fixed for safety reasons after being told it would happen)."
Break lease agreement 
The tenant should pay the local rates.
Repairs on things in the home in a timely manner
the inequality of power between renters and landlords
Better recourse in terms of bond return
"With the amount of investors we have had to move 12  times in as many years due to them selling & we have people coming through the house all the time it seemed. There needs to be a cap put on entry to the property when owners sell rental properties. 
Leases should be void & renters have the option to move out weather they have a lease or not when property is for sale. "
Stricter regulation on Real Estate agents appeasing house owners to strip bonds from tenants at the end of a tenant period.  I have had this experience in the last 2 properties and I strongly feel it is collusion between real estate agents and owners.  To improve this a non-biased 3rd party needs to conduct the exit reports as there will be no conflict of interest.  Real estates are only interested in keeping their income from property owners and have no interest in the rights of the tenant.
More rights for renters. The landlords and estate agents can be nasty.
More affordable and obtainable properties.
"Periodic Leases - because they favour the tenants, as landlords, we will use them.  if left as is, they might as well not exist."
Less restrictions in regards to pets including the pets being allowed inside the house - many properties that allow pets stipulate they must remain outside the house which is unfair on the tenant and especially on the animal.  
Real estate agents treat renters and landlords terribly and don’t make themselves available to people who work full time.
Hold greedy agents to account
"Helping out the landlords who have tenants on welfare, as many of the landlords don't wish to raise the rent as they are aware that their tenants are on fixed incomes. If these people were not in private rental they would be on the government housing list.  "
"Allow personalisation of house, such allow placement of hooks/bluetak etc for hanging pictures etc as long as the walls are reinstated upon vacating premises.
Tenants should be able to offer to split costs to get a lower ongoing cost option for things like solar hot water systems or solar panels."
Being allowed to hang photos/pictures 
"We as renters have to be considerate to our surrounds ,l think the property owner should also, but in my case no she is not."
Lower the rental cost
Stop large rent increases and attend to all repairs & maintenance when problem occurs
Finding an affordable home in a good area. 
Being allowed to hang pictures on the walls
"Ensure that the ability to remove Tenants  who are well behind in rent, damaged property, abusive to other tenants is not a long, legal battle if eviction is required.

There is a permanent 'Official' register of these tenants."
My own experience is good when I have a good working relationship with clients and customers in achieving a “win” for all parties
"As an owner, legislation needs to be more fairly slanted. Too much consideration given to tenants. Owners should have more rights concerning the investment they own. For many, it is their retirement and needs to be maintained. If tenants want to have rights about owning pets then perhaps they need to buy their own property and devalue it."
"6 month inspections 

They feel intrusive to say the least and make me feel like I live in a prison"
Give the tenants more of a voice on issues
"After downsizing from home ownership throughout my life to no longer wanting to own and maintain my own home at my age and on my own, I was able to rent a brand new unit from an incredibly decent landlord. He did not hesitate to allow an inside dog, add security doors and screens but also has personally fitted hooks for me on the walls.
One thing would be to have slightly cheaper rent - around $250 a week rather than $300 plus .
But I can't really complain because I have it so good.
"
"As a renter previously, if you have history of exemplary inspection results, I think there should be, perhaps something like a star award system, which equates to, LESS FREQUENT INSPECTIONS.  It is only a money making exercise on behalf of the agents as they get paid by the inspection by the owners/landlords.
As a soon to be landlord, I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA of all pets allowed.  I would not have an animal IN MY OWN HOME, why should I have to allow a tenant to do so.  They say ""not an inside"" pet, but that lasts for a week and then they are sleeping in their beds.  I think the owner of the home, who after all, has to pay for replacement of carpets, scratched walls, repainting, or even new turf when worn down by a large dog, who is not walked enough.  Pet ownership should come with a licence, where you look after your pets, regular, walking, washing, cleaning of bedding etc. Also pet birds attract cockroaches.  The LANDLORD should have the YES/NO say regarding pets."
to have my pets and pictures on the wall
"Nothingits fine, it’s about treating the rental property with Respect. 

One point, a central register of tenants and landlords to rate them, yes, tenants might get a bad rap as ap well, and this information needs to be public.   No hiding behind a wall. "
That the real estate/landlord would actually fix the problems in our current rental home 
Landlords must fix all house issues within  1 month 
Stop discrimination against pet owners
"Pets allowed in more rentals. Real estate agents need to act on problems such as leaking taps, locks etc.  Property managers need to be more competent and listen to tenant's reasonable requests. "
To make realestates more accountable for putting in bad Tennents that wreck or don’t pay the rent 
Improved rights for tentants
Better respect from property managers when owner decides to sell. Always made sure unit in good condition for viewing but agents can be pushy even when provided multiple periods for viewing.
Engage with the real estate agent a bit more when I have concerns or questions. 
"I rent my property out.  Having to issue multiple breach notices to Tenants who continually delay payment of rent and, or not maintaining property to acceptable levels e.g. mow lawns and damage due to the allowing of animals inside or children drawing on walls."
"As a landlord I have had my house completely trashed by tenants,   while I had insurance to cover the damage,  no action is available against the tenant.  I will never rent a property again.  There us no support for landlords,  all the law and regulations are about protecting the tenants.  I've had a few rental properties and it has always cost more than it is worth. There has been no government support, just more costs than it is worth"
"A renter has little control over the out of control  prices and endless rent raises for sub standard properties, in the last couple of years it has become so stressful not knowing how much your rent will increase with each new lease.i am a pensioner! Unless i share i cannot pay the rent for overpriced properties.i think a cap needs to be set so greedy landlords can't  keep increasing the rent .especially when they won't  do repairs."
"To improve the way the tenant is treated by all parties in the process - not being made to feel like the tenant has no rights and are untrustworthy, when we are the ones who are the clients and the landlords and owners are offering us a service."
Give more power to the owner.
Quicker turnaround regarding refund of bond
better affordable options
Tennant seems to call all the shots
Ray White Real Estate Emerlad have been extremely unprofessional and difficult to deal with. I signed a 12 month lease on an executive house and it’s been a nightmare. I had now working oven for 6 months and I had to pay for fan and water system repairs. I own multiple properties over Aust and would never allow my agents to like this towards my tenants.
It would be desirable if some updating to the property were done.
Longer leases normalised.
Being more easily able to request a different property manager for the house I'm renting
Allow picture hooks so I can hang up my wedding pictures 
there is a shortage of good and working couples in the hervey bay area.
"Create something like an online portal to keep all records of everything between landlord/agent & tenant to be able to freely access ledger, rental details, notices, communication regarding issues, reports or requests etc"
"Tenant ranking being available to owners and property managers.
Notice period being the same for the owner as it is for the tenant or vise versa. 
"
"tenants have no rights, owners just walk all over tenents"
Increase in ease of access to repairs
Less house inspections for good tenants and not so many invasive photos.   Also if your a good tenant with a good pet history then landlords shouldn’t reject your application because your a pet owner 
no added fee on rent payment
"Quality of service from Estate Agents - there is such variability and so many horror stories, yet little recourse renters have due to the power imbalance for fear of being black-listed"
"There needs to be a better method to hold real estate agents accountable to how they treat tenants. 
In the current system they are able to hold bond and rental history/ reputation as blackmail against the tenants without grounds or evidence with seemingly little consequence for their reputation and work."
"The way real estates drum up competition at open inspections, it is intimidating and you feel under pressure to put an application in quickly."
"The rents going up as much as they are, its just about to expensive living on the street is a real possibility for many"
"As a tenant, having more flexibility to leave. This includes a lease being guaranteed to become periodic after one year fixed term; and being able to terminate the fixed term lease early if notified to leave within two months of the end date, without needing to get extra written approval from the landlord to do so."
Getting required maintenance done quicker
"The tenant should comply with the General Tenancy Agreement - Form 18a which they signed at the beginning of their tenancy. 
Often tenant leaves without giving back the property keys, not paying electricity bill or behaving unpleasantly while an owner is inspecting their property for reason if e.g. a new dish-washing machine is really needed."
Actually have repairs attended without rental increase each year. Have solar power available to assist with electricity bills. 
Private landlords thinking they can do what they want because it’s their property. 
owners maintaining the properties
Hang my artwork on the walls to make it more homey
Tenants pay there rent on time. 
Less entry notices. More options for pet friendly rentals. 
More rights for property owners. 
"I found a great place after searching for over 1 month. There was a lack of secure, affordable, quality housing for just 1 tenant (including a car space). Many affordable places were broken down inside, or renovated - but without adequate safety/security. Safe and compact city apartments were often without a car space."
Landlords/owners having more rights to remove tenants who are mistreating the property. 
More clarity on condition reports and abolish the words ‘as is’ condition
Landords to do more maintenance to update appliance such as ovens cook tops when they are over a certain age 
"Not be made to move out because the owners want to move in and only have 2 months to find a new house and have to come up with a few thousand to move including the new bond. Also it is difficult to find a place when you have 2 cats. If I have to be chased out of the property market by investors who are driving up the prices, fine, if that is how it is then I don't have a choice but then those people make it impossible to rent their houses! It is awful."
Constant pressure 3 months out to renew my lease
Better  maintenance by the owner.
Better communication when there is a problem. 
"Rents a too high.
Houses aren't required to be kept in good repair."
"Tenants and owners should have access to longer, perhaps, unlimited leases, which can only be terminated with several months’ notice, and only on reasonable grounds."
"stop rental prices becoming exceedingly high or exceedingly low !!
needs to be much more balanced for renter and owner."
"Security in knowing my home is my own for the forseeable future - we have had to open our doors to architects and planners for them to inspect our property for ""potential for apartment blocks"" etc without giving us any details, which results in a lot of uncertainty for us as tenants."
"The insecurity of long term rentals, rather than always having the fear of the owner's returning.
"
"Bonds are inadequate to deal with damage caused by tenants who do not take responsibility for their actions. There is a vast difference of understanding as to what constitutes fair wear and tear.  Indentations / scratches on dining tables when place mats are supplied, burn marks on carpets due to a hot iron,  skirting boards chewed by their dog (no approval was sought, nor would it have been granted) torn fabric on dining chairs (again due to a dog), glue on another chair is not fair wear and tear.  Nor is the non use of mattress protectors when they were supplied. People’s standards are different.  In handing over our property for rent we ensure everything is in excellent condition and yet tenancy laws around cleaning and return of our property to us leave us always out of pocket.  We do not like the proposed changes which allows tenants to change the paint colour, make structural changes and have pets without our approval. have animals.  The changes should not be a blanket decision. "
Owners be held more accountable for the condition of the property they are renting. Real estate agents need to be accountable to someone. These people can be dishonest and ruin people's lives with false accusations and get away with it
Landlords having the power to remove you from your home at any given time. Making your rental property your home by putting picture frames up or painting walls. Also having the choice to own a pet. 
Rent by myself instead of sharing. 
"Rights to own pets, and have less frequent inspections."
Place more responsibility on tenants to care fro property
"Applications are assessed on whether rent is less than 30% of tenants' income. For many people, particularly marginalised communities our income is not high enough for the 30%. I myself spend 60% of income on rent. 
This makes finding a place to live extremely difficult, especially considering accessibility issues for those such as myself who are disabled. 
Another issue is the lack of pets allowed properties. As someone with complex mental illness and a neurological disorder, a pet is a highly useful support. However animals other than dogs cannot be registered as therapy animals, and many properties don't allow pets regardless of how good the tenant's rental record is. 
"
Allow pets under bond
"Real Estate agents able to make decisions about urgent/pressing faults, instead of having to co tact the owner first. "
"This does not apply to me, but the state some rentals are left in, the tenants should never be allowed to enter another rental."
"Long term tenants of the same property should not be subject to 6-month inspections. It is intrusive and not convenient for those of us who work full time. I would prefer an annual inspection, especially when every inspection has been faultless over a 4 year period. "
decrease the time it took for rental agency and land lords to makes repairs once it is reported.
Allow the police to enforce rent arrears.
For real estate agents to be more competent and professional.
Being able to have a small pet and I have struggled and taken a real estate agent to court before for bond issues - not enjoyable.
Additon of pets included when renting
Ability to screen prospective tenants fo criminal history. 
Some councils charging more for investors by way of rates etc.
Higher pricing that Is not affordable for a couple with plans of a family
More accountability from real estates. 
Real-estate agents treating renters as people. They assume renters are lowlifes because they don't own the property.
more rights to live in the house - I must reapply every year
"Improving future planning requirements to incorporate mandatory renewable energy for strata buildings, and provide access to charge electric vehicles"
More dwellings that allow small pets 
Not getting shafted by Real Estates after spending thousands of dollars on cleaning. They still find bs reasons to take the bond.
Notice to leave increased from 2 weeks to 4 weeks for tenants. 
Less inspections - every 6 months instead of every 3 months when you're a long term renter (over 5 years)
"That tenants be more responsible for care of the property.  ie if they break something, they fix it, not just be classed as wear and tear."
Significant power disparity between tenants and landlords - tenants have next to no rights.....
Having inspectors from the rta that can come and inspect a property if the tenant feels that it is unsuitable to live in 
Tenants who do the wrong thing should have more accountability.
Applications need to be simpler and agents not allowed to ask for information that they are not meant to have and are unable to validate eg bank statements etc.
Landlords keeping bond saying the property has not been cleaned effectively when it has and was not clean when you moved in.
Make property managers have to conform to a minimum standard
"Customer service, honesty in agents not trying to rip off tenants.  Getting things fixed without taking months"
Take away the power of agents to evict you for no reason at end of lease. It makes you afraid to complain about anything 
Not allow landlord to have open home inspections
More communication with managing agents
Better and faster system to protect me from bad tenants
"The ability to have pets. I have a dog where I currently rent, and when time comes for us to move, I will be limited by my options. I love my dog, she’s a part of my family."
Longer notice period when given notice to leave. 
"Reporting, rent amounts, and time frames on maintenance, "
"More say for the owner ,no of pets , no of persons in home and what the home can be used for "
Tenants damaged our property and agent didnt pursue damages
Allowed pets. Hang pictures
"I believe that the burden of maintenance and upkeep of property falls too heavily upon tenants. Though owners are required to respond to maintenance requests by tenants, often issues can take several weeks or months to be fixed once maintenance requests have been issued. Resultantly, tenants can find themselves living in irksome or even dangerous conditions while they wait for the problem to be addressed. This will often result in tenants trying to fix the problem themselves, or at their own cost. The former can lead to 'tenant-created damage', which then causes the tenant to suffer loss from their rental bond. The latter is manifestly unfair. Tenants should be able to withhold rent without threat of eviction if maintenance requests are left unacknowledged for a certain period of time (7-14 days), or another solution should be found to this problem."
Market price value on rentals may be more tax deductions if you enter affordability scheme 
"Reduction of Home Inspection Frequency and forbid property managers from entering tenants homes when the tenant isn't home, especially when the property managers are photographing their home and belongings. "
"Allowing tenants more freedom in how they choose to live in a home. By that I mean a paradigm shift in the balance of power between landlords and tenants. Instituting regulations that encourage longer term leases and allow for subletting, allow for tenants to have more ""ownership"" of the house they live in (ability to repaint drab walls (to a standard), hang pictures, etc...). In allowing for longer term leases, present landlords the ability to adjust the lease price in line with rental indices."
Lease hand backs as i never get all my money back despite using professional cleaners
Would not have purchased a NRAS property. 
I’d want the owner/ landlord to work fast and harder at fixing issues rather than leaving it and hoping I’d forget. 
more rental properties that allow pets
Easier system to transfer bond so don’t have to pay it out twice to move
Having more consequences for real estate agents not getting repairs done in a reasonable amount of time.
Availability of agents to show or return correspondence about rental properties 
"'- Inspections should be to check for structural damage only (not whether I have cleaned the garbage bin etc).
- Real estates should be required to answer queries within 24 hours where they relate to structural work being completed on the property or a maintenance issue.
- if the landlord themselves is completing work on the property themselves (because they are a builder), they should not be able to invite other persons to the premises.
- when building work is being conducted on the property tenants should be notified of the start and finish times of the work and these should be respected unless the tenant consents (i.e. if you say you're arriving at 8, don't arrive at 7am etc)
- if an appliance (eg stove), light or other fixture is broken in the property it should be trplaced with something that is the same or better, not the cheapest equivalent (e.g. don't replace a high quality stove with a low quality)
- if a tenant is without a major facility  (such as a shower, stove, air conditioner) that were there when the lease was entered into, the rent paid by the tenant should be decreased until it is fixed
- if there are security issues with the property (eg. people entering into the yard etc), the tenant should be entitled to secure the property with a lock on the fence etc so long as they provide two keys to the real estate
- landlords should ve required to pest control the property (inside and out) annually
- if keys to the property are given to tradespersons or access to the keys is given (eg through a key garage on the property) the landlord or real estate should be required to secure the keys at the end of the day by receiving the keys back or by changing the code to the key garage (otherwise that person can return at any time and still have the code where they are able to access the key garage)
- if a landlord makes major changes to the property during the tenancy (renovating a bathroom), the should be required to gain tenant consent and to come to a reduced rent arrangement that accurately reflects the intrusion on the tenants quiet enjoyment of the property
- if renovations to the property occur during the tenancy, they should be required to return the property to the same or better condition as when the tenant accepted the lease (eg unpainted or half painted walls can't be left and if the bathroom previously contained a bath, shower toilet, it should still have all these at the end of the renovation.
- real estates should be required to provide a copy of the tenant ledger every six months and at the end of the tenancy"
Allowing pets in more places
"I moved into a property in Queensland from Sydney. The house was owned by the Real Estate agent, unbeknown to me. The cupboards were full of rat shit, There was no gas, There were no fly screens or light globes in inside or outside lighting. The water was brown, the bath not clean. The dishwasher was not fixed for 9 months, the oven didn't work, until the stove was replaced after 18 months and despite being told the house was on the sewer, the septic exploded, with shit through the downstairs after 2 years of moving in. The firebox, which I refused to light, fell apart when the man came to repair it. Nearly every day I had off from work, I had to be available for tradesmen.  Four months after I moved in, I had to go back to Sydney because my father was dying from cancer, With no official listing, the agent decided to sell the house and after coming home I was subjected to endless inspections. Presumably she thought I was about to inherit a lot of money. I doubt if the house was ever listed for sale, she was trying to get me to buy it. Tradesmen entered the house when I was overseas despite my neighbours telling them I was away. I have been subjected to endless harassment fro 3 years and expect a Real Estate agent to abide by the rules. I have obeyed all the rules re prompt payment of rent and keeping the property in beautiful condition; the agent has obeyed none. I have also had 3 monthly property inspections where the person inspecting the house has behaved like the Gestapo - not just looking for water damage under kitchen sinks and basins but opening my personal drawers and cupboards"
Being able to remove bad tenants sooner that stop paying there rent as they know they can get away with it for weeks till the notices are lodged and due.
More governance to control dodgy real estates regularly taking advantage of tenants and their bond return.  
There is far to much weight on the tenants side the landlord more than often get the raw end of the stick with the current laws.
Some owners misuse the rental agreement system to their own advantage while totally trampling on tenants rights
Communication from real estate about change of property manager; communication turnaround time from property manager after routine inspections; increased proactivity of real estate staff.
"I have rented all my life away from my family home
I always took dumps because that is what I could afford. I was a single mum.  I am not crying - poor me - I say this so you can see I had little money.
I had to move every time the lease was up.  I did not have a chose. I had done nothing wrong - I would find the rent had gone up quite a lot - or the place was to be pulled down, or up for sale.  But it was more for I had asked for something to be fixed, which it was never fixed, by the time I had to move out anyway.  I have had to buy a small stove for the stove did not work and they would not replace it.  I have even had RayWhite - fix it, man do the wrong thing when fixing on asbestos, grinding it - without damping it and coverng thing - he did not even tell me he was going to do it - so i and my son breathed in this crap.  I had lost it when I saw what he was doing - called Ray White and they told me to bad - prove it.  NO one cared.  
We hear about the way renter treat place and how it outrages everone and it so on.  Yes it is wrong very wrong- but where is the out cry when it is the landlord or place like ray white - we do not hear about this very often, WHEN THEY BULLYING AND BREAK THE RULES AND LAWS DO WE.  

We are thrown out as soon as the lease is up - if we dare to ask for things to befixed, or speck out about anything they have done wrong.  No not all do this - but many do.  
I am renting a place at this time, that made sign an form that was a exreport that was not filled in, i was told I had to for it let them know they have given use one.  Right this is a lie we know it but had no chose.  If I did not we would not been able to rent this place - we would have been homeless.  SO WE THE RENTERS HAVE VERY LITTLE RIGHTS - IF WE WANT A PLACE TO LIVE WE WILL DO AS THE LORD AND MASTERS, THAT HAVE HOME TO RENT SAY.  WE WILL JUMP THROUGH THEIR HOOPS AND KISS THEIR ASSES, OTHER WISE WE ARE HOMELESS. 

Every time I move - I never got my bond back in full AND IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THE PLACE WAS A MISS.  I STARTED TO STAND UP AND HAD TO FIGHT EVERY TIME.  Ray white - yep again.  for a differnt place - try to make out I left the place a miss - with photos, the judge said - I am not calling you a liar - but with the photos I had shown him that the place was left neat and tidy.  Photos are more and more important - keeping every little thing you get from them every little thing you send them.  It is even to the point you need to record every time you talk to them... It is beyond a joke.  I have never been able to have photos up on the walls - they did not want holes or even these hooks that stick on the wall.. I could not even lean photos on the wall.  Nothing was to be on the walls.... I have never been able to put photos of my son on the wall.  come on...  


I could right a book on the crap I have had to put up with and so can many others....  I WAS TOLD - RENT IS SO HIGH, BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD IT, OTHER WISE IT WOULD NOT BE THAT HIGHT....  right pay the over inflated rent prices or be homeless - yep we have a chose....  

We need a more fair rental polices in place - one that a three party handles - that the three party does the inspections and handles the day to day thing like fixing things.  Take it way from the realistates they are greed - let them handle the finding people to rent - for they do not handle the money anymore it is a three party - that add to our rent - every time we pay rent we have to pay $4 or more every time we add a payment of rent - if we have to pay every week then it cost more and so on.  

IT is not fair we are paying a three person and have to pay the fee they want. 

So why not have a three party to do the inspections and KEEP the to their rules and laws. "
Remove fees from making rent payments. I have recently been forced to use the DEFT payment system by my LJ Hooker real estate agency and they lied during the process (not offering fee free alternatives and a few other issues) and whilst I have won a temporary reprieve I have been told the lease will not be renewed unless I use the DEFT system going forward. This does not sit well with me. The charges are in my opinion excessive at .80c for non credit card transactions and $4.80 for credit card transactions. The system neither benefits me as the renter or the landlord - it merely saves the real estate agency accounting costs. Why should I pay for their cost savings? I imagine any fee free offering will be made to be unworkable i.e. pay at the agency in person when I have to work full-time.
Don’t introduce policies that negatively impact owners rights
"Better resolution and mediation via the RTA,more training and knowledge with the RTA staff needed, they dont understand the information they are giving out to any tenants or owners. QCAT needs an overhaul, Judicators can be rude and need to be more understanding with objections and hearing the truth"
I would like to be able to have pictures/photos on walls
"Nicer, more empathetic owners
Allow everyone to have pets as pets are a part of the family."
Ability to remove tenants without cause 
Further powers to the RTA to advocate on your behalf where there are breaches of contracts / laws / rights.
The ability to negotiate long term leases with pets
I have rented with Dept of housing for 30 years and I would have to say much more affordable rent prices especially for low income people and exclude using children's child support maintenance as part of the rent.
harsher consequences for tenants who damage properties and leave properties in disgusting states. this increases costs to landlords. this increases costs and reduces the number of decent properties and affordable properties for others to rent. 
"Owner and agent need to listen more of what the tenant requested, especially when its come to the property not meet requirements "
"Increase in rent in a fixed term, should be abolished 
Increase in rent can only be in written form before signing the agreement that there will be an increase in rent in a fixed term.
Or fixed term means only the amount is paid for the fixed term, not increasing the rent in a fixed term agreement"
Make tenants more accountable
More support to landlords who's properties get minor damaged outside of 'general wear and tear' by tenants which is valued under the malicious damage insurance excess on landlord policies.
Real estate to be more urgent/reactive
balance the laws between owners and renters
Better communication with property managers
I would like for the tenants to pay rent that they owe I have had three tenants in the last year who have not paid there rent and have left. i am still trying to recover this money. As  most  of these tenants are receiving centrelink i would like to make it  mandatory for them to pay the rent by centrepay before they get the rest of their money.
Make tenants take more accountability for looking after the property they rented.
"Having too many clauses or ""annexe"" additions to a rental agreement, it is very confusing and hard to understand. The rules of the tenancy agreement seem to change everytime I renew my lease."
As a tenant - Better communication from my property agent especially around routine inspections. 
"That external contractors abide to the property owners requests of what works have been approved, not rely on what the tenants are saying..."
Tenants need to be accountable and should pay all monies owing.  Tenants who do not meet their lease agreement should be accountable for the costs involved. It is too easy for them to just leave and not pay monies owing.  It then becomes the responsibility of the owner/rental agent to chase the money owing or have to go through other agencies to recover funds.
Tenants to provide 30 days notice of their intention to vacate. 
"If a agent fails to attend an inspection, they need to give a 1 - 2 month grace period, they can't keep doing 1 week back to back notices. 
If a yard has asbestos like ours did - then strict rules on cleaning need to be enforced"
Repairs to house and better service from the real estate agents 
Tougher penalties for people (both landlord and tenants) knowingly doing the wrong thing
Removing problem tenants is difficult. The QCAT waiting time is terrible. I think this should be quicker.
"Better management by Property Agents, from both a tenant and landlord perspective"
"Being able to have longer times between inspections, being able to hang pictures, having my beloved pet inside with me "
Make bond refund system fairer.
"Being able to visit the property once a year to check personally on the condition.
"
I feel that the notice period that tenants need to give to vacate (14 days) is too short. I think it should be 30 days. 
Buy my own property if I could.
"Security- owners deciding not to renew leases because they worry about age and length of time in a property
They should be made accountable for why they are removing good/excellent tenants"
Have more options to remove bad tennants
Making tenants more responsible
"More pet friendly, easier application system and less rent gouging"
"Improved governance over Agents managing property, we have had a couple of agents and they don't have the owners interest as a priority, they are reactive not proactive."
Open house applications should banned 
Landlord contact with tenants and the time it takes for RTA lodgements
My Realestate has made it alomist impossable to get my Bond back over simple Wear and tear 
When my husband was discharged from the RAAF after 22 years service we could not rent through a rental agency because we had no rental history! We owned our own home that was rented down south and had rented from the Dept of Defence but that did not count. I think there needs to be a way of taking this into account.
Educating clients on Housing Standards prior to moving them in. 
nothing - the RTA conditions are satisfactory
"There should be laws where RTA has the authority to work with local council in terms of overcrowding living arrangements of other units or renters in particular with regards to noise, rubbish and overcrowding in a unit complex. For example Air BNB arrangements and or tenants who leases to sub sub tenants with no limit and making money out of the situation."
length of time between inspections should be longer.
Faster access to QCAT adjudication / mediation services.
"Make it easier for families with animals to rent, more available properties allowing pets (cat and dog)
More notice for inspections
More leniency with hanging frames and artwork on the walls"
Options to renew for less than 12 months 
properties that allow pets 
The reaction time for the owner/landlord/real estate fixing a defect/completing maintenance on the house/land when required.
More flexible rental arrangements
Mandatory requirements for safety before renting a property and a specified time period to have repairs carried out.
"Less inspections and more autonomy - putting gardens in, safely putting hooks or whatever to hang pictures (which make it a home).  Maybe even painting?  Possibility of a longer lease and the ability to make the place a home."
Lease detail and term
Landlord entry and inspection rules.
"Currently there are no rules on how much the annual rent increase can be, it should be in line with inflation. "
The cost of property management
I would like to be able to transfer my rental bond between rental properties when I move.
Making the process simpler for owners to request tenants who aren't respecting the property they are living in to be evicted.
"I had an exceptionally poor, stressful and time consuming experience renting through a real estate agent. I now rent directly from the owner and have had not a single issue for 5+ years. Real estate rental needs serious review of their abuse of power.

I just read the next question - when renting through an agent it is impossible to know what the input or views of the property owner are."
allowing pets. Pets are instrumental to helping people with loneliness and mental illness. They are companions and family members.
Consistent information - I find the same question can be answered but you will receive many different answers depending on the angle it is asked
Not allowing rent to go up unless major changes are done on property. Also owners that charges for all water usage should be force to install water tank on the property for tenants usage. Also having to wait months to get things like a hot plate replaced.
"As a tenant - nothing comes to mind except maybe easier/more freedom to keep pets.
As an agent (PM) - More /tougher repercussions for tenants who willfully damage property, or do not pay rent etc. "
Making it easier to have pets in rental properties 
To make it easier for Landlords to claim money back from tenant for damage
Tenants be more involved in repairing small things like light bulbs
More pet friendly leases
The needs RTA to have one policy for all. At present the RTA pendulum is in favour of the tenant.
Heavier enforcement of bond lodgement for landlords.
"When I rented- RealEstate's can be quite difficult to deal with- eventually having to give a breach notice for them to return paperwork, living 6 months without the fence been fixed (was told the owner couldn't afford it) and then on my exit they arrange for the fence to be fixed. I spent my six months cleaning up the place after given to me in a disgusting condition and then on the exit was told ""well some tenants are good and just fix everything for us"" I have never fixed so many things in a rental (that I was not obliged to do) in my life

As a owner I have been lucky with my tenants- the current one always pays on time and is looking after it. It was only when I arranged an inspection myself that she told me about some issues with maintenance- had told the Real Estate many times and still waiting for them to be fixed, so it is very frustrating at times dealing with the real estates who are meant to act as a go between (and are paid quite well for it) and not much gets done.

The RTA have been very helpful for me"
More onus on property managers/landlords in terms of dealing with terrible flat mates; rather than somehow expecting the not terrible flatmate to work it out.
"Twice the apartment I was renting for the long term went up for sales and I found that the viewing of the unit were far too frequent and intrusive, came at too short notice and property managers were careless in how they managed their visitors. Example: leaving AC on, not asking people to take their shoes off white carpet, etc."
Rental History records
Dropping the rent more to make it more affordable for tenants and giving good tenants a lower rent amount to encourage them to stick around.
Pay less rates!
Pets allowed in all houses 
More options for pet owners 
That the contract period is longer and the termination period also. 
The property was very dirty when we were given the keys and the condition report poorly completed.
More housing options with yards for Pets 
Tenants should receive a copy of all photos taken at inspections and be allowed to remove personal photos etc before photos are taken
Improve more protection for the Landlord and the premises.
The way we as tenants are treated by property managers.
Realestate agents that follow through on requested repairs. Especially the ones that make the house uncomfortable to live in.
Make tenants more responsible 
To give landlords more control over renting their property to tenants
Ability to make changes to home and have a pet
Length of leases increased for film stability 
"I would make rentals more accessible for people with pets. So many responsible renters have pets and I don't think it is fair to block them from housing both themselves and their pets. In fact, discriminating against pet owners should not be allowed, unless they have a history of being irresponsible in rentals. There should definitely be an officially accepted way for a renters to prove their pet is well behaved and not likely to damage property (i.e. letters from previous property managers/ landlords, letters from vets etc.). It is unfair to make an assumption about a renter and their pet that would impact their ability to live in a rental, without investigation or further consultation."
Unless it’s a holiday or student accommodation (that’s furnished) make tenancies a minimum of 12 months. 
I am a owner of a property in Queensland that is rented
"Upon receipt of an entry report,,a tenant has a mere three days to reply.
This is disproportionately unfair to the tenant, who is likely to have left a previous rental, and so is arranging bond cleaners, etc., etc., so is unlikely to be able to respond.
This period should be increased to seven calendar days.
Additionally, there should be a sanction for misrepresentation on an entry report which should be significant. 
An example. We rented a property, the agent claimed it had been bond cleaned, yet there was an old razor, bar of soap, and toothbrush in the bathroom. When challenged, the agent admitted she had not actually ""been inside"" the property.
This type of obvious lie should attract a personal $1,000 fine. It would stop the practice."
Tenant paying rent on time
Easier to have pet approval
Body Corporate fees are too high
Give tennants more rights and security.
I would say 3 inspection the first year then every 6 month the second year and once a year from the third year. If everything was fine before of course. 
Royal Commission into Rental Agencies
Less useless property managers.
"Being able to have a rental that you can treat respectively as your own, within limits of course. Being a model Tenant should come with more rights, such as hanging pictures on walls without having to wait weeks for a yes or no from Agents, as previous owners  this should be a given, if done properly and tastefully. We have never had any problem with having our pets, except from 1 Agent in our town who thinks she is god, and refuses to allow any tenant to have pets, even fish! "
Rent is too high for houses
Making more properties pet friendly & wheelchair accessible.
I’d make landlords more flexible around pets. I’d also make the application process easier.
"More onus on tenants leaving properties in good (not necessarily perfect or untouched) condition, but not trashed as is seen in so many cases"
"Security and flexibility. Renters should not be treated as second class citizens for not being able to afford a home. Renters should be able to have more autonomy in how they manage their homes and better security. I think for-profit property managers create a divide between tenants and owners, exacerbating a schism that shouldn't exist in the first place. "
"Paying bond off or being able to transfer between properties 

Cheaper rent if you’re in a single income"
improved standard of exit cleans - 
Affordable longer leases for young renters.
"Inspections are invasive and too frequent, majority of property managers are too overbearing and treat you badly. Very difficult to find rental when have pets which is unfair "
"Be able to remove unsuitable tenants faster.
"
The right to own a pet while living in any rental property. 
Greater respect for privacy and peaceful occupancy
Cooking and bathing facilities consistently good. 
Do not have tenants that damage my property 
"Look after landlords better
QCAC orders tenants to pay back rent and there is no enforcement
"
Changes to the exiting tenancy process. Your personal relationship with a property manager is often what determines the end of tenancy process and if you disagree with something then you have to spend weeks fighting it out
Make quicker and easier to evict tenants and becable hold them responsible for damage and non payment of rent
"As landlords, we had to evict someone through the courts, and the tenant appealed the decision at local court, then to QCAT Which took over two years to resolve the issue during which time we were no allowed to sell the possessions to recover our cleaning and storage expenses."
property managers to be more communicating with tenants
The ability to make the house a home by hanging pictures and attaching furniture to walls and also having pets allowed 
Fairer rights for Property Managers and Landlords
To have the tenants less power & for the RTA to give us Landlords a fair go in any dispute!!!!
"More rights as a Landlord. If a tenant doesn’t want to pay, they don’t and all they walk away with is a mark on the system whilst the Landlord is left to repair the property and cover the mortgage repayments until a court hearing can be made to recoup the costs. Harsher penalties should be put in place for a tenant that doesn’t pay their bills. Perhaps putting on their credit file as well? The risk seems to be more on the Landlord than the tenant. "
"Review of existing laws to better protect Owners from tenants who are responsible for extensive damage to rental properties during their tenancy. From painful personal experience, bonds do not even go close to covering repair costs to make properties habitable again. Defaulting tenants owing considerable sums just 'disappear', and most owners just give up on trying to pursue them through the legal system.  "
Communication between agent and tenant
I'd like more freedom with decorating to make it more like my own home.
"Better scrutiny of property managers.  Not allowing tradies to come into the home without an authorised representative of the real estate, or without a tenant home.  We have no idea if these tradies are police-checked or anything, and they potentially have open-access to our homes and possessions if we are not present."
"Tenants are billed directly by Urban Utilities for their water consumption the same as occurs with all other utilities such as electricity, gas, telephone etc."
"I have good relations with the tenants staying in my properties and get involved in their initial selection (rather than leaving it only to an agent). As such it enables flexibility on both sides that is needed to accommodate tenant needs (rent flex, length of leases) and owner needs (flex for larger repairs, flex in accessing the property to perform repairs). Means to prompt tenants to better maintain properties on a day to day basis/   "
Increase the term of tenure. Agents will not offer more than a year and try to increase the rent without landlord's approval.
More consistency in all stakeholder requirements when dealing with different real estates.
Being able to have pets at any rental that is suitable and not having to pay an increased rent price for places that allow pets
"A cultural shift - tenants need to be seen, and see themselves, as CUSTOMERS rather than as a lower class commodity."
Better property managers. 
"Allow pets in rentals as a standard permission.  For people who own pets, their pet is essential to their mental health and being declined a rental on the basis of being a pet-owner is discriminatory. I understand the need for tenants to keep properties in good condition, so perhaps the part of the rental agreement that deals with property upkeep needs to ensure that pet owners take responsibility for maintaining good standards in terms of property cleanliness and condition. "
The tenant to have more rights without being prosecuted when using their rights
"Rules about having pets at rental properties. Not everyone comes from a background of privilege that will allow them to be a home owner one day, no matter how hard they may work. However, many consider pets a part of their family and they are well known to improve mental and physical well being. There should obviously be appropriate restrictions (especially for high density living situations, etc), rules, mediation processes, pet protection (RSPCA) for pet owners that are not acting responsibly, potentially even bond increases & all costs incurred by the pet owners & not home owners. But many people are unable to find appropriate living situations for themselves and their pets meaning families are being broken, people are losing their companions & well trained pets are being given up & euthanased due to the outdated rental rules allowing owners to outright refuse pets at properties that are well equipped to accommodate them."
"It feels that some real estate agents treat renters as second class citizens. More convenient inspection times when looking for a property to rent, most inspections available are during the week and in working hours which make its difficult for people like me who work full time during the day to make it to inspections. Better communication when it come to inspecting property for rent. Example that happened to me, the appointment was at 2pm, I had to leave work early, which cost me $200 in wages for the day, i was waiting at the property for the agent, only to get a text message half hour later that the appointment had been cancelled, only to find out the next day that the house had been rented out to that real estate agents friend. "
Ability to vet tennants
I would stop the rent increasing every time we re-sign our lease. 
"More protection for renters when the owner decides to sell the property. 


set time frames for repairs to be made and finalised"
"Landlords fixing things, I have the owners drop in when I haven't been home and found them snooping around then issued them a remedy breach notice. Unfair rent hikes without doing any repairs etc."
I believe that the tenants have too may rights and landlords have few.
"Reduce the competition for rental properties, and unrealistic rental prices by making it easier for families to purchase their own home."
"The legislation is all there which can work for both parties.  Unfortunately the system to enforce the legislation lets everyone down on both sides. It's too hard for anyone to pursue an issue which means if it is a bad tenant or landlord, they have a lot of power. 
Additionally, no-one should have the ability to claim the bond.  The wait is is, whoever claims it first has some power over the other.  No-one wants to go to court. "
To look for cheaper rents.
We have been renting the same property for 7 years now and have an inspection every 3 months We do understand it is an investment But it is so intrusive inconvenient the realtor said no one needs to be at the property when they are doing the inspection But seriously we don't know these people basically they are just people we don't know.after 7 years with no problems inspections should be once a year or every 6 months seriously we look after this property like it was gold             
Less inspections with only photos being taken if damage.
Too many rules protecting the tenant.  Landlords become wary of doing improvements as tenants demand so much that need to save money for trivial repairs usually involving call out fees.
"If you are a great tenant and keep property very clean you should not have to have real estate and or owner coming through property every 12 weeks after the first 12 week inspection. Should be every 6 months for long term tenants. 12 weeks comes around so quick. If owner inspects property twice a year and agent inspects property every 12 weeks there is no quiet enjoyment of property and this is not fair,   And agents should not be allowed to take photos of bedrooms, especially children's bedrooms as this is inappropriate. Especially agents who take photos of bedrooms with their phone. Invasion of privacy. "
being able to claim bond back througt Australia Post in counrty areas
Tenants are currently allowed to damage and not leave a property in the condition it was in when they started their tenancy due to the ambiguous clause of 'wear and tear' and then cry foul to QSTARS.
Mandatory Health and Safety checks on Rental properties. 
THAT RENTERS ARE MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LEASE THEY SIGN
Cheaper rent OR more pet friendly rental options. 
"Pets allowed, can’t get kicked out with limited notice"
More application of rule enforcement to tenants
Make it easier to find rentals that allow pets. 
"There is a very strong conflict of interest when leaving a property. That you Must use the agent recommended cleaner/maintenance otherwise getting your bond back is made extremely difficult on purpose. If you use their recommended people, the agent then intervenes and takes ""ownership"" of the relationship yet the tenant is the client of the Cleaner/maintenance person etc as they are paying the bill.

I find this relationship very inappropriate as the Cleaner/maintenance person feels if they do not side with the Agent then they will lose work. 

I believe there should be a separate authority protecting cleaners/maintenance companies from this unfair/unreasonable treatment and that this authority also monitors real estate agents that treat tenants and cleaners/maintenance unfairly 

There seems to be an accepted pratice from landlords/real estate agents to bully tenants so they relinquish their bond to repair items that are the landlords responsibility. Especially if they are selling the property

I am also a Landlord and feel real estate agents are not honest and ""play"" tenants off against landlords and visa versa. That information is not honestly shared between parties."
I would like better communication between landlord and tenant. Sometimes I don't feel the message is being passed on by the real estate agent. This can cause both parties to be dissatisfied.
I have had no issues so have nothing I wish to change currently
Less invasive inspection schedule
Faster action on faults/repairs
Landlord should not have to give 2 months notice to end a tenancy. Tenants who breach rent payment for longer than 4 weeks should be able to be evicted easier.
"As a property manager and property owner I find the laws look after the tenants. 
Bad tenants are placed on TICA then after 3 years they drop off. The tenants know this. We actually had one guy pay $50 towards his debt, then must have found out about the new law dropped them off TICA after 3 years, and he didnt pay any more.  As a property manager, I like to know who I am putting into a property and we pay good money for access to TICA's database. Bad tenants should stay on TICA until they have paid what they owe the landlord and not be able to rent other properties. They can rent government housing."
Communication between the tenants and owners when a property manager is engaged. I'd sometimes visit the property to attend to a repair that I had been told about a couple of weeks prior only to find out the tenants had raised the issue with the agents months prior. A greater level of transparency would be helpful.
Getting maintenance done in a timely manner without fear of eviction at the end of the lease.
Ability to pay off the bond
make it easier to ask tenants to leave for rent arrears
By ensuring there is equal power and legislation to protect both landlords and tenants and not favour one more so. 
Entry notices by mutual agreement - tenant should have the right to want to be present when ANYONE needs to enter their home and to negotiate a time/date suitable to both parties.
Notice of Intention to Leave - increase notice to allow landlord's to market property
Rentals are difficult to get for first time renters.
"At the moment I'm in a great rental, however, one thing I'd change in relation to past experiences is the lack of options that renters have when they are dealing with real estate agents. Often you will be coerced into doing things that aren't lawful under the Rental Tenancies Act, or you will be put through the ringer to get your bond back when you've left your place in better condition than when you moved in. I feel like there isn't an easy process to make a complaint, that doesn't put you at risk of ramification in terms of your rental history and rating."
"RENTAL weekly Cost  for contition of Property , the Agent ,some ridiculous stringent rent conditions."
Better communication directly with owner
Have equal benefits for both owners and tenants - very much for the tenants
Minimum Rental Period
Ensure their is equality for both landlords and tenants
Nothing to be honest. No issues at all. 
Not give in to tenants so easily again
Make it easier for landlords to access tenant information for screening purposes rather than having to go through real estate agents.
The price of rent especially when compared to the quality of the homes. eg. poorly maintained homes are still astronomically priced for rent. 
I'd prefer more choice about who I can let live in my property
often if privately managing tenants will want to not pay rent rather than receiving their bond
Being allowed to make the place into our own space without going over the top. We had to ask permission to put up our clock that kept falling over. Other than the clock the walls are bare to the point the landlord will not allow a towel rail or toilet paper holder.
The rights of the landlord have been diminished dramatically over time and the landlord is the one who pays for everything and suffers the consequences of tenant's neglect. The laws need to be more balanced
Affordability and freedom for pets
Provide better opportunities for landlords to recover cost of repairs for damage caused by tenants. The Current disputation process id too much in favour of the teant.
"As a tenant, transferring bonds between old and new rentals would reduce the stress of moving"
"Pets allowed at all properties, better real estate agents/property managers in general, properly cleaned houses prior to moving in 
"
"Agents and owners should consult the renter before sending entry notices to suit themselves. I do not feel entry should be a given without a reasonable opportunity to be present.
Inspections every 3 months despite keeping an immaculate home is insulting and unreasonable. The reason given was it justifies the agents commission rates the owner pays!"
More/ cheaper rentals that allow pets.
The way rent is increased by property managers without consultation or readdress.
There is nothing much we can do until we have rented and by that time it is too late - agents are two faced most times
Increase fairness for both parties
More properties open to small pets and being able to personalise the space more
Tenants whose rent money comes directly from Centrelink should not just be able to tell Centrelink to stop paying rent money to their landlord/agent if they are still on a lease and leave the landlord with no rent money. 
To make the property I live in more homely with pictures on the wall
"The willingness of the property owner to be more amenable to pets, both cat and dog. "
More requirements for agents to disclose why an application was declined 
"Landlords should have the right to dictate within reasons how long the tenants are there for, whether they can have pets.  Landlords pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest for their future. If they can't dictate the terms no one would invest in QLD resulting in shortages of houses for rent and the economy."
Make sure owners have the right to say no to pets if they think it will damage the property
To be able to remove tenants who break the lease much easier.
Be able to hang pictures on the walls. 
Having more pet-friendly options available.
Allowing pets without needing approval.
"Allowing pets in all properties as they are a part of the family, they are companions for the lonely. There is not nearly enough properties that allow pets."
Locked into 6 months lease. 2 months before lease ends asked if want to lock into another 6 months lease. If you say no I would prefer to pay week by week with no lock in period. Then threatened with eviction notice. Then you get a 2 months  eviction notice. If you try to leave property before 2 months. Then threatened with advertisement fees for advertising for new tenant and cost of rent until such found new renter and the move in and start paying rent. This is ridiculous and costly to the original renter. Renter literally has to take whatever is available to rent at time of end of lease. Very unfair system!
A little more input from Real Estate Agents
Consistent rental managers
"Real estate agent does not seem to be engaged. When we call to complain about better managing the property, they are very sweet. But on the whole it feels like a tick the box exercise to send us our bill. Especially disappointed about not reporting damage and early breakdown of goods on property. By the time they did the report, it was past the ""6-month"" builders warranty. Also not a real report is sent to us but a log in portal so we have to remember log-in details to get our report. No personal touch. "
"Be able to have rooms painted a colour of my choice with owner's approval, that isn't ""rental cream"""
STRICTLY PETS ON APPLICATION 
Improve owner rights in relation to tenant damage and recovering costs.
"Property owners have virtually no rights in terms of being able to evict tenants in a timely manner that seriously breach their tenancy agreement. It can takes months to run through the nonsense procedures to remove a tenant from a premise costing landlords thousands of dollars which can never be recouped. The whole system is geared unfairly to tenants who abuse landlords, and the government's legislation protects them."
Improve property inspection on vacating property
"Landlords should stop being so greedy at the end of a tenancy and give the tenants back their bond, only if the property is in good order. Regardless of age and condition when tenants move in. "
Being asked when a repairer is coming to property what time they can arrive instead of collecting keys from real estate and helping themselves into my home
"Required formal training for all rental property managers, including commonsense and people skills. Also basic communication skills with spelling and grammar."
"Tenant to be made aware of particular rules applying to their particular property - eg, Strata By Laws, pets, get permission to change any of the structural areas of property and gardens etc"
Stronger laws requiring tenants to be responsible for damage to property - being able to act quicker to remove a tenant who doesn't pay/damages property
National register of tenants who trash homes with mandatory jail terms . 
Better understanding of condition reports both entry and exit
Renting/Security checks on renters before renting properties
Facilitation of direct interaction between landlords and tenants 
Have onsite managers handle building rentals
Not having house inspections every 3 months
I have had to chase bonds after tenants have given notice and then stopped paying rent to the value of the bond and then you have to chase to get costs of repairs and cleaning ect done but have not been successful. RTA has always refunded the bond to us  but never the 2 times it has happened it did not cover cost of damage and cleaning-  a list of bad tenants should be kept by the RTA and if requested advise to the property owner can be given  regarding  suitability of the tenant and vise versa advise to the tenant regarding problems with landlord-a fee could be charged  for the service.
Rights favour tenants
"Reduce discretion of property managers, increase rights of owners and tenants"
Easier to rent with pets and being able to have pets inside i.e.cats.
The ability to charge higher bonds in line with a risk assessment as Insurance Companies and Banks do.
"Insufficient protection to landlords due to failure to pay rent and damage to property.  The basic problem is that a court order to an ex tenant in not enforcable.

"
Fairness for larger families/pet owners
Have ALL real estate agents be listed with the REIQ and have a legislation that is fair for all along with harsh punishments for bullying and harassing tactics used by realtors 
More fairness to owners after remnants trash a home
"Real Estate agents should be made more accountable with rental inspections and not just tick and flick designated criteria. 
Set number of properties per property manager. 
Separate board designed to meet landlords concern. "
A balanced Tenancy Act with advantages to both sides
Fewer restrictions on pets
"If I could change one thing, it would be to allow renters to have a pet on the property. I have seen a few rental properties that only allow a dog under 10ks and no more than 30cm tall, however I don't see a valid reason for this. I have a large dog who has a great rental history in Melbourne (no barking/digging/destructive behaviour) but for some reason due to his weight and height, I cannot find anywhere to rent. We wouldn't put weight restrictions on people to rent so why do it to dogs!"
Force landlords to do repairs to property that people rent.
Finding reliable tenants who respect rental property.
Make sure that tenants look after the property 
"when I went to claims court for a tenant issue the court sided with the tenant without hesitation or listening to our concerns, they made their mind up before we entered the room and was very unfair and we had been VERY fair with our tenants "
More legislation in owners favour. 
Easier to rent with dogs and slight modifications to home ie. a nail in the wall if it’s fixed upon leaving.
Make the owner do repairs in a timely manner.
Information on rights and responsibilities of both parties
Tenants to have an understanding the difference between fair wear and tear and damage
Being allowed to claim for travel expenses when attending the property to make repairs. We live 6 hours drive from our rental property and it requires overnight accommodation as well as significant fuel costs.
"Tenant to be more responsible for damage to property and furnishings. It is always hard to get repair/replacement monies from tenants. It seems to be the same excuse over and over, ie : Fair wear and tear. "
"Must be allowed to claim for travel expenses when travelling to repair a domestic rental property. Man properties, like ours, are in regional areas, where tradesman are difficult and expensive to get."
More active and responsive real estate agent. Allowed to keep chickens
More fairness for tenants needs.
being able to hang pictures on the walls
"I am an owner of several rental properties and I find that tenants have more rights than owners. If your place is damaged (thousands of dollars worth) the tenants get away with it. The bond does not cover it and then trying to find where they have moved to take court action is pretty much impossible. 

Pets, I strongly disagree with allowing renters the rights to have pets. I have had many places damaged by pets well over the bond amount. Insurance companies will not cover pet damage. It is my property so I should be allowed to say if I want pets in the property or not. If the Government wants to stop with rights of the owners then maybe the government pays for any damage caused to the property. 

I am also strongly against tenants being able to make modifications or changes to the property.   "
I think longer tennancys over and above 1 year should be offered 
Improve capacity for Indigenous tenants to pay rent
"Honest and accurate Routine Inspection Reports. Whenever tenants vacate we are left with costs for cleaning and damages and yet very rarely is there any indication that the rental property is being abused.
 Never enough in Bond to cover these costs and we are left out of pocket. 
Landlord Insurance assesses claims as individual incidences meaning an excess on each incident can be more than the claim. "
As a property owner and a property manager all we want is tenants to pay rent regularly and look after the property
Third party governing body that allows the renter to grade the realtor with that grade carrying an influential (financial) component to their success. 
"More Rights as a tenant, when I lived in Italy it was a lease on a property like it was your own.. no inspections and you are able to change the property as you please within reason. It lead to more long term leases making the place feel like your own. "
That Agents managing the property actually ensure that the tenants do understand their obligations re the property care and maintenance.
"I would definitely improve the system of receiving bonds back after renting. Each time my family has rented they have left the house in an exponentially better condition than how we received it and still a couple of hundred dollars were always stolen from us, from the bond, through lies and deceit."
A say and a meeting with the owner to highlight the maintenance of the property yearly.
Owners not being able to list for sale until 2-3 months from the end of contract. 
"That the tenants have to pay for damages and lawn ect. As an investor, I feel that the tenant have a right to damage my home and not repair it along with not maintaining the yard. I feel that it is always the owner's responsible cause they put in cheep turff, fittings ect. But we didn't the tenants just have to maintain the home. "
"Long term tenant should be able to terminate their contract more flexible without penalty or force to pay rental fee until the end of the contract.  Normally tenant has to sign 6 or 12 months contract, but after this period end, it should be flexible, especially after you are staying after 3 years."
Make tenants more accountable for damage to property and upkeep of outside.
"Rents to be set and reviewed by a valuer or the RTA, not landlords"
Tighter rent arrears management 
As landlords greater control of own property and more property  owners rights
Ability to make the house a home e.g. placing things on the wall for a fear of mild damage.
"The expectation that tenants be responsible for damage to property, not rely on landlord insurance."
"Pay rent on time.
Do not damage the property."
Property Managers seem to care more gor tenants than Landlords
I have previously been a Tenant and am now a rental property owner and based on this experience I don't believe changes are required 
I would suggest that property managers address maintenance issues during the tenancy and not when it is time to vacant. It has been my experience that land lords and property managers always try to take all of part of my bond when I have vacated. 
More availability for owning pets
Tenants must advise promptly of any maintenance or repair issues. Tenants should be responsible for simple maintenance issues eg batteries in remote controls
As a property manger there is a disconnect between Tenants notice to leave at end of lease and notice to end tenancy by landlord (2 weeks by Tenant 2 months by Landlord) this is unfair and needs to be more balanced. 
I found trying to apply for a property so difficult. The only reason I was fortunate (after months and months of trying) was a friend of mine let me move in as her room mate and it was her ex husband's friend who was a real estate manager who helped me find a vacant property for my son and I.
Pets should be allowed in all properties by default.
The uncertainty of what happens at the end of the lease. We are always worried that the owner decides to sell and we'll be back on the market looking for a new home to rent for my family and children.
"The cost of rent is too high, especially for sole parents who have to bear the cost of all living expenses, and those of their children, alone. Could there be more subsidisation for sole parents? Once rent is paid, there is almost nothing left over for other basic needs such as food and payment of utilities bills."
Reduce rent. Let the renters have a say. Agents and owners have too much power keeping the bond amount with them.
"Greater obligations on property managers to properly monitor the condition of homes that they manage and if they fail to do so are responsible for costs incurred. One property manager returned the full bond to a tennant and ignored the destroyed shed on the property and the damage to the house. This has cost me almost $20,000.00"
"Agents have zero accountability. We currently pay $625 per week for a home that has been falling down around us. Agents take up to 7 weeks to have an issue resolved or discussed with the landlord. We have to continue to pay rent in spite of this and have no course for action to improve our living arrangement. The homes are not how they are advertised and there should be some comeback. 

Secondly, agents and landlords are forcing us into long-term (6-12 month) tenancy agreements when personal circumstances arise that require a grace period of even a few weeks. Example - my husband is currently looking to be offered a lucrative position within banking on the south side of Brisbane, meaning we'd need to relocate from the north side for his commute. Our lease ended 1 week ago and we contacted the agents as there was no tenancy agreement or discussion had about us staying on/leaving. As a matter of courtesy, we notified them that we'd need a few weeks grace to see if my husband was successful in his position before we locked into another lease arrangement. We've now been told that we MUST sign a lease agreement tying us to this home within a few days or arrange to move out. We have always paid our rent on time, put up with appaling service by the agents, allowed the owner access at any time and had flawless inspections. There needs to be allowable and reasonable legislation put in place to protect tenants when their circumstances are genuine and would place them in financial hardship to tie into another lease. "
"The new internet based rent processing platforms are inequitable.  Every time a tenant pays rent a transaction fee is imposed.  This can add up over the course of the year, if rent is paid on a weekly.  I don't understand why the impost should be paid by the tenant.     "
Real Estate agents making it very hard to get your vacating bond back even when your home is spotless. I have been told there is a bit of scam going nowadays when Agents do not sign bond refund form unless you get your house cleaned by bond cleaning companies and the agent gets a cut of the money. 
"1. When applying for a property, it should be fair. If the rent is for example $550/month, ensure that applicants do not bid with the Owner's approval.  This is not a fair process and happens quite regularly in Brisbane."
I would establish a separate regulatory body and instigate a Royal Commission. 
good tenants that respect the property
Management to have set rules of which to follow or though l am happy with crew l deal with now
Better involvement with Body Corporate so I am more informed about happenings in the building
Less rental inspections and quicker responses to maintenance issues
I believe tenants should be required to maintain the premises to the agreed required standard throughout the period of their tenancy not just get it up to scratch at the end of the term of the lease.
"Have the time period for giving notice for tenants to leave reduced to 1 month.
Have the time period for tenants giving notice to leave increased to 1 month."
less negotiation attempts on fixed agreements. 
There needs to be a sensible early exit clause for residential lease agreements. There is no obligations for rental agents to even attempt to re-let as in general they are lazy and immoral. I gave 6 (paid in advance) weeks notice to exit a rental agreement in a market where we were told initially 'we were lucky to get the house as there was so much enquiry). Now they say no one is interested. 
"More rights for renters! (eg right to pets, right to make minor changes like hanging photos and painting walls) "
I don't like vertical blinds and find that if they aren't in the best of condition that they can look really tacky.  I also find inspections to be stressful as we are home a lot and the house can be untidy due to normal living although we do our best to keep everything clean and maintained.
"One thing I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T CHANGE is taking away my right to terminate a tenancy at my discretion at the end of the agreed term of the tenancy. Our rental property is our future home and if we need to move from our present location due to ill health, we expect to be able to live in that house so that we can be close to medical facilities if required. The last thing we would want to get involved in that situation, is having to endure a battle with the tenant to get our hose back. "
"I would get a very Thorough check before accepting them,eg Rental histories and background checks. I would also not allow any pets and no nails into walls or renovations without my consent."
"If the rent payments are going to increase, the property should reflect the increased payment with maintenance completed or additional resources implemented. I feel it is easy to raise the payment due to demand however not improve the property. "
"Tenants to pay for consumables (water, sewerage, council taxes) like the rest of the world."
"Landlord must have control of his property and be allowed to decide on any alterations, pets or number of persons residing at the property"
That the real-estates do their job at all and properly!
"Remove the fear of being breached for making the property feel like home eg. picture hooks, not having the property look like a display home for routine inspections etc."
Repairs requested to be completed in a reasonable time frame
We would like a long term lease of 5 years not just year to year.
Non smoking places should be made clear
Remove Pets Allowed altogether
Tighter restrictions on tenants
Making the rules balanced when it comes to notice periods for vacating a property.
Make renters more accountable 
Rental income doesn’t even pay the mortgage after 7years
"'- Better alignment of minimum notice periods for tenants and landlords (e.g. - tenants currently only have to provide 2 weeks notice to terminate lease vs. landlords 2 months)
"
"Rent increases should only be a maximum of 2% and that should be only once in 2 calender years. Agents and landlords should not be allowed to arbitarily increase rents.    One other thing is that only one prospective tenant should be allowed to inspect the property at a time and only his/her application should be taken and processed.  If this application is not suitable, only after that the next prospective tenant should be allowed to inspect the property and put in an application. This means ONLY ONE APPLICATION AT A TIME.  This literally means more respect for tenants and their time.  EQUAL RESPECT FOR LANDLORDS AND TENANTS PLS."
Property managers must complete adequate training and keep it up to date; and compulsorily present their qualifications to their clients/ landlords .
Having home owners take more responsibility in repairs. 
Ask tenants to be more accountable for the wear and tear on a property
"Interview the agent, like they do us. Ask more questions about what they will do for us as a tenant, and not just go by them giving us the standand book. "
be better informed at times by the agent that manages my property
"The dishonest real estate agent, who, it turns out is not Registered or Licensed at all. "
It would be good if renters could get longer lease after an initial trial if they pay their rent and look after the landlords property.
Exit reports that considered entry reports. It’s always an issue. 
Not use ray white 
"More rights to Landlord.
Tenants to pay for total water bill etc
More notice of intention to leave.
Higher Bond"
The ability to make small changes without being penalised I.e pictures hooks
I have a property manager so I do not have a problem but I would make sure that private owners self managing a property show evidence that they know what is involved in doing a good job. 
"1.The price of rent.
A one bedroom apartment the size of a shoebox really shouldn't be as much as we are paying.We need to up size soon but are afraid we won't be able to afford it. For a growing family, this is a disadvantage 
2. We would like to have a small allowance to hang up picture frames or shelving on walls. "
"1) Easier mechanisms for removing renters who breach their rental agreements
2) Limit ever-increasing council rates and insurance"
"Less extra costs
"
"when things go wrong such as rent arrears or having to evict tenants who do not look after the property, it comes at a high cost to me as an owner, and rental bonds may easily not cover all expenses for damages, cleaning, repairing and repainting that I incur at the end of a tenancy."
Tenants were quick to damage my property. Got conned by a tenant
The rules are by far in the tenants favour.
Properties need to be looked at by a neutral party prior to a renter moving in.  Outside opinion of the state of the property and what needs to be fixed and updated to standards
Have a better way to have tenants pay for damage etc done to the homes when they leave or abandon them as the bond does not cover the costs
Have more faith in the rental agency sometimes you don't want to approach them for the way you are spoken to 
"Get rent money more frequently. 
Be able to charge more to cover all outgoing coasts and still cover mortgage. "
The option to have pets and repairs to be done quicker 
"real estate agents to ensure proper inspections on homes for maintenance that the tenant should not repair. tenants are not always able to sight maintenance issues. when this becomes an oversight and and issue and the end of the lease, real estate agents hold a tenants bond to ransom in order to get maintenance work done which is not the tenants responsibility. I have heard and seen far to many occurrences like this. its almost a ""best practice for some agents. Often this is never challenged by tenants as they are not in a financial position to fight it."
"Increase bond to six weeks or have a minimum value. Tenanted properties of ours that have been managed well by a real estate in the past, have had poor quality tenants leaving us more out of pocket after they’ve vacated. Even when RTA awarded us entire claim, it’s then taken to a court of law which can be expensive and time consuming. "
I would like rental agents to be more professional in the running of their businesses.
Have less property inspections and no photos taken of my personal belongings.
Make it easier to have a conversation about reducing rent price if renting for an extended period of time. Maintenance request actioned properly.
Making the rental feel like a home. By allowing pictures on the walls and having pets.
Tentant have a longer term 12-24 months
"The process that a Lessor has to wait after non payment of rent until a QCAT court or  Wait 7 days  before a breach can be issued, then wait another 7 days to pay the unpaid rent, then another 7 days wait for Notice to Leave and when that does not happen at least 8 weeks  to approximately 12 weeks for a QCAT hearing to obtain an urgent warrant of possession then up to 2 weeks for the Police to act all without rent."
"Require a higher standard be applied to rental property managers. The are usually poorly trained, incompetent or over worked. "
"Police the real estate agents, they have all the power and often completely abuse it"
Timely reaponses from Real Estates and Owners
To be able to choose who you want to rent 
"The lack of power renters have, vs the abuse of power that occurs with real estate agents."
lower rental prices with longer duration between inspections as well as having more of an opportunity to treat rental like your own home eg make small improvements
The rental bond system. It's far to convuluted and badly needs updating
Difficult when owner changes Real Estate office. Not sure if anything can help that.
Nicer real estates. I feel they are very judgemental 
Being able to have pets. And being able to hang artwork on the walls
Response time for owner to react to repairs that impact safety and quality of life
Improve the quality of property managers.
"maintance  of home when asked for it to be done eg roof, guttering, mould"
Need a better return
Give some rights back to the vendor.
Permission to keep a dog.
Owners usually disallow pets by default.
Tenants responsible for their SPER fines
"I would like a public approval register for real estate/leasing agents state by state, this would enable landlords to quickly decide cost against performance, without having to find out the hard way. "
Real estate agent did not allow bank transfer payments
"Pets accepted in rental properties, better and more transparent communication with property managers"
"That the property is maintained in excellent condition. We have submitted several maintenence issues (2 of which are significant to safety), most of which have not been addressed with the Rental Agent ignoring several emails and calls from us."
"For property managers to actually know the legislation and not use scare tactics to try and bully you. Sometimes they will say it is the law and when you look it up yourself, they are wrong. "
There has been little increase in the value of the property in nine years.
"Mandatory Carpet Cleaning to be done and receipt provided, to ensure the next tenant is receiving hygenic carpets.  Pest control should be mandatory to ensure no fleas are present for next tenant, as there is no guarantee they are not laying dormant, and should not be at the owners cost should they be discovered once a new person move in. "
less property inspections for long term tenants
"Improved rights for renters: eg ability to have longer leases, more stability and security"
The attitude of the real estate agents. I've had three agents and two where horrible and unaccommodating.
update safety standards for rental properties
"The existence of  ""black lists"" make the process unbalanced"
"The standard, ethics and behaviour of property managers."
Keeping the rent as the same as I am a good tenant and been here for 3 years now. Also have a 12 month lease
Rules applying to selling a property with a tenant in place.
Every rental property should be upgraded to have a dishwasher and brand new locks at no extra cost to the tenant. Black Mould and any types of Mould should be taking extremely seriously and should be fixed at no extra cost to the tenant. 
"Tenants should pay the outgoings as they get the benefits from them (water, rates, etc), in line with other commonwealth countries."
"A longer period to put in your inventory report on a property when you move into it.
4 days is not long enough.
Most properties are difficult to find the damage until after you have settled in.

I have been burnt by this before when exiting a property."
"More housing for pets, better landlord restrictions."
Give the landlord more power for when tenants breech their lease agreement.
Making sure Owners fitful promises made before signing a lease. Making sure Real Estate Agents stop ripping renter off of there bond by making up false damage and cleaning.
So far we have not many problems with our tenants.
"allowing to be honest with choosing tenants,setting a standard for the condition of house without having to be politically correct or have to consider feelings first when it comes to renting - it is a business transaction & should be value for money"
"I am yet to come across an agent that treats tenants fairly. We are not second rate citizens because we are renting. I for many years was a home owner but now that I am renting (middle aged, post divorce), I see the difference. There are just as many bad landlords/property managers out there - it is just that a tenant can not take any action for fear of being breached and therefore finding it difficult to rent again. Harcourts Springfield Lakes - take note!"
The perception and public push that all landlords/rental property owners are out to rip off tenants -- this is also promulgated by media and Government. 
"You never feel as though it is your home because of the constant intrusion from agents, contractors etc.

You aren't allowed to do anything without gaining permission, which depending on the landlord and agency will either be rejected or will have to be done their way.  

exit process - property managers who delight in claiming your bond, even though you have left the property in better condition than when you entered it.  You bust your chops trying to leave the place spotless and when they finally do their inspection a few days later, they claim there is a cobweb or something trivial to try to claim your bond.

There should be an independent exit inspector that does not work for the landlord or tenant and is impartial and consistent in their expectations."
the change in property managers is ridiculous information is lost repairs not followed up on and rental increases not corectly applied resulting in stress and anxiety for us as tenants do something to keep property managers at company's and keep the number of properties per manager capped at 80 to 100 so work load doesnt impact on quality of service to tenants and landlords
Create a minimum standard for property manager training and experience requirements.
More thorough entry conditions reports being conducted by property managers
"• Make tenants accountable for breaking lease before agreed period.
• Tenants to pay an allowance for regular property upkeep"
Expect tenants to be more responsible 
Easier to evict tenants that are in rent arrears.
Give the landlords more rights to look after their properties and stop tenants destroying their homes.
"Clear guidelines, expectations and legislation to ensure real estate agents and owners do not take advantage of tenants when vulnerable (ie. experiencing domestic violence). Also to ensure the victims in these situations are not penalised. "
"Landlords being able to exclude children from properties, the ability to auction rents"
Tenants pay for maintenance of items they use regularly such as air conditioners.
Being able to hang up your own pictures and having pets without being persecuted 
"I would make the legislation more balances and not effectively the ""abolition of land owners' rights"" legislation."
rental agents can not add what they like into the rental agreement and need to follow what the RTA sets out 
"The lattitude renting agents have with raising notices about things that are not valid, and entry notices continuously with no limit"
Ensure that when a landlord needs to take possession of a property due to change in their own circumstances (and a lease has expired/is periodical) that they can do this without fear of property damage or refusal of tenant to vacate. Also need to ensure tenants cannot refuse entry when a landlord needs to have other parties visit the property when proper notice is given.
Who you rent through. Real Estate Agents do not make it easy.
Better protection for BOTH parties against parties that don’t do the right thing
This insane rule that property owners make you sign up to another lease eight weeks prior to your fixed term lease expiring. It should be automatic that all tenants go onto a periodic lease when the fixed term finishes to allow time to look for another suitable property if required. Not have to listen to the lies that the owners 'force' us to resign fixed term agreements because their Landlord insurance won't cover them if one is not in place. Why should the tenant be penalised if the owner has issues with Landlord insurance?
"Letter will detail items for consideration.
Professional carpet cleaning by tenant should be required on exit.
Owners should have the choice of pets or no pets and types of pets.


"
The 2 months notice and the 2 weeks notice periods need to change.
A lease is a lease. Its a signed agreement and must be honoured not only by the landlord but the tenant as well. 
"From a Property Manager's prospective, there is not much support or empathy from adjudicators at QCAT in favour of owners rights for claims of unpaid invoices and rent. Tenant advocacy groups eg Tenants Queensland need more training in legisation so as to provide more accurate advice to tenants seeking their assistance."
"The rights of the owner are getting less and less and as a property manager we are ending up with more tenants vacating and owing monies; leaving properties in a unacceptable condition etc..
I find that the Tenancy Advocacy Groups need more training as some of them are giving misleading information to tenants "
"I would not change anything, I feel rights of both parties are ok as they are."
Maximum of two domestic pets be allowed for every tenancy without approval by owner. Perhaps an extra pet bond be raised.
Lenghty process to go through if a tenant doesn't pay rent anymore and I have to evict them.
"Tenants to be more accountable for damage done.
Improve the process of being able to remove a tenant when they default or cause damage."
Less red tape and ability to deal with dispute effectively
More responsibility on real estate agents for neglecting properties & harder penalties on tenants who trash properties
Stop tenants destroying houses and walking away 
Give more rights to Land lords (owners)
"I believe it would be more beneficial for owners and tenants for there to be an equal amount of notice given at the end of a tenancy, or when vacating under any circumstance other than un-livability. For example; if the tenants wish to vacate they must give 2 months notice the same for if the owners want the tenants to vacate."
Renters being held responsible for damage and lack of rent money paid. Culture equal.
"More responsibility for tenants to be responsible for cleaning and maintenance of rental property, especially newly installed appliances, floor and window coverings so that replacement is not required every 3-5 years!"
"More extensive and thorough Inspections from Property Managers.
"
For rental companies to rent houses to people from the age of 17 with a income without discrimination towards there age and for rentals to be a bit cheaper to afford when u havent got a big income 
Our current situation is that leaving the premises the owner expects that the condition of the house will be that the house is in the same condition as when it was built. Aging and sun damage to eg. blinds is not damage. If the tenant has regularly cleaned and working order is maintained then normal wear and tear will always be a factor in any residence if the tenancy is over some years. Realistic expectation of normal wear and tear needs to be explained to all parties. 
Tenants not paying rent. Having to constantly chase real estate. Tenant 1mth behind. Pays 4 weeks still 1 we behind & advised RTA STATES unable to make tenant be at least one week ahead. Then the circle starts again.
Access to tica for private rental owners
"Have all rental properties inspected for safety compliance, decks, stairs, slip trip falls, RCDs etc."
Reference checks and Rental checks
Hold real estae agents more responsible when they make errors and don't do the right thing by the landlord.
"The landlord needs the ability to enter the property for repairs or suspected damage by tenants.
Also, there needs to be tighter regulation for overdue and unpaid rent."
A bigger bond to cover any damage done to the property by tenants who do not take adequate care of the place they are living in as it’s not ‘their’ house/flat. Tenants should also oay their own bills such as water and waste.
"Not sure how to change this, but....the thing we disliked the most was how real estate companies treat you like a 2nd class citizen in all of our dealings with them.  Yet as a landlord, they treat you as a first class citizen.  We have been and will be in both positions as we have an unconventional life.  It is a bit degrading being a tenant when dealing with real estate companies.  Good luck at fixing this particular issue. "
More power and control over rental property
Greater feedback from Real Estate agents as to why repairs take a long time to organise or are completed in a sub-standard manner.
"Checks on landlords.
Tighten rules where multiple tenants are paying huge rents in favour over local families. Ie backpackers. 
Landlords doing more maintenance on shonky buildings.
More public housing especially supported."
"as an owner of investment properties in QLD (2) and renting my current residence, there needs to be an improved process for reporting poor property management, currently only option if disappointed with below standards is back through the company managing, other options I have had to use is posting online to get action."
"If the tenant has to break lease, make the maximum amount payable 4 weeks (instead of the current fee plus paying until it is rented, because in a declining rental market it is impossible to re-ret if the rent is above market rates.) Renting in Qld is not currently flexible, as renting should be. In NSW the max payable is 4 weeks rent."
landlords can be left out of pocket if tenants are problematic and insurance for this is expensive and has a lot of loopholes (for example determining malicious versus accidental damage by tenants)   
"
Compulsary air conditioners in rentals"
Real estate managers attitudes
more legal power for managing agents to remove troublesome tenants
make the break lease regulations for both tenant and owner the same amount of time.
"I think Real Estate agencies are overconfident about their power to scare tenants. They wont lodge the bond, they wont have a fine as the law says, they wont return the bond, they will overpromise on their ads and they will manipulate you, they will scare you, they will completely treat you like someone who doesnt have any rights. This is unacceptable in any country who presumes to be developed."
Bad tenants deserve to be named & be accountable
I am a Property owner/landlord and would like to see improvements in the loaning process with Student accommodation.
Ending a tenancy for no reason
"As the property owner I have been left out of pocket on a number of occasions for rental arrears, bond not covering expenses etc."
Freedom to make hang pictures 
"Realestate/property managers need to be held accountable for their action or lack of. There needs to be formal standards. 

E.g numerous divets in the ceiling are not fair ware and tare.  NBN additions to a rental need to be approved by agent or owner. "
"The choice to have a pet, regardless of the person who owns the property. everyone deserves the right to own one. 
another one is the possibility of having utilities included in the rent as the cost of living is so expensive as it is, rent on top makes it near impossible.  people can't buy houses cause its expensive and renting is the only option and restrictions put on by the property owner, doesn't make it feel like a home, let alone feel like they are able to live in it freely.
"
More consultation between property manger and owners
"Making Property Managers more accountable for enforcing the lease terms - eg No pets inside property.
Having a mandatory system/data base where Entry and Exit Reports have to be uploaded by property managers within set timeframes. - we have personally had many occasions where property managers have failed in their duties of completing these reports, and hence we have lost money because of it.

"
Make sure the rental property owner is better protected!
"That as a landlord we have more protection from tenants who lie about their intentions, misuse a property and hide behind flimsy laws that protect them."
More security for tenants so we don't have to be afraid of eviction our non renewal if we ask for maintenance to be done
"With costs increasing, increase bond to 6 weeks"
Longer rental contracts with fixed rental increases.
"As a landlord, I feel it is difficult to remove troublesome tenants from property. "
"'I think that good, reapectable tenanta deaerve protection from unscrupulous landlords.
To preserve balance, I also believe that landlords deaerve beter protection from delinquent tenants who adamage and/or impair the  value of their asset 
- in our case, our ONLY retirement aaset.
In the past, I have been confronted with tenants that refuse to pay rentals as agreed. In one case, my beautiful, well maintained property was trashed, literally, before the tenants could be evidcted. Contents of pantry and refrogerator had been scattered across the brand new carpet;  the infant's nappy had been removed. The RTA bond was totally inadequate. "
Laws about big trees that hang over a house.
"Landlords are providing the residence and fittings however the tenant should be also responsible for their usage of items and where breakages occur during their tenancy eg the light maintenance or replacement of light bulbs, smoke alarm batteries, call out of repair services for minor items (setting temperature on oven etc)"
Central records system.  Rented for 7 years have had three diffrent real estate property mangers and have to go thought the forms each time
Stop owners rejecting applications because of pets
Better communication and understanding from the realestate 
I live in a non-smoking building. Our neighbour smokes inside his apartment and the smell and chemicals enter our home. We feel powerless to stop this.
Being able to hang pictures or less frequent inspections for long term remters
Communication between tenant and property manager
Increasing rights for the landlord as they are financially liable for the property as they actually own the property.
Stop taking rights from the landlords
"there should be an equal amount of time given to both the owner and the tenant when they decide to terminate the tenancy.  At this stage as an owner, we have to give 2 months notice if we want them to vacate, they only need to give us 2 weeks - this is not fair.  We have bills to pay and to get a new tenant in such a short time, always leaves us out of pocket"
"government & laws to be setup to ensure both owners & tenants are safe but also held accountable for actions & regulations. Seems only too often that owners are left open to financial effects in the event of a disrespectful tenant, when ultimately the word ""owner"" should remain exactly that and in cases of renting there has to be the basic respect of other poeples property held as a first & foremost. "
"Moving from an expensive and long Bond system to paying an insurance cost instead.  Once the insurance is paid by the tenant any insurance damages/costs etc go to the insurer (government regulated). For tenants who have more than 2 infringements  their insurance premiums go up , saving tenants thousands of dollars upfront (it can take a long time to get back and we have to pay bond again when we move before getting the previous money back). This will also expedite any remediation costs to the owner and lessen the burden on agents. "
"As a vendor, I would like protection from shonky contractors who do a poor job and cannot be located.  Had a very bad and expensive experience."
Owners should be made liable to complete repairs within a decent timeframe 
Easier option getting maintenance issues fixed
"I would give the Property Management permission to make  repairs or improvements without having to consult and wait for approval from the owners, commonsense prevailing of course."
Less red tape more trust
More rights should be given to people who actually rent and not always to the Property Owner or the Real Estate.
Rental prices are you expensive 
"A legal requirement on landlords & their agents to disclose all benefits, and avenues of appeal the tenant can access, as part of the leasing process. "
allow tenants to pay rent straight out of the pay is that they don't fall behind
Stop tenants damaging property then able to leave with no remorse or ownership for damage.
"Personally i have never rented but from being in the business, Grounds for entry into a renal property is definitely an area where more options are needed."
landlords have the right to there investment not the government
Better options for owners with difficult tenants 
To be allow more freedom in making the house homely. For example allowed to hang pictures and add gardens or hang curtains without having to ask permission. Often the answer is no.
Laws should be tightened to ensure tenants pay for all and full repairs for damage to properties. 
"Stability. I feel homeless. Constantly anxious that I might have to find the time on money to move again 6 months leases are far too short. 

I wish there was an option to rent a home. If I had a 5 year lease I would put time and money into the gardens and improve on the property. But 6 months I don’t even unpack all my boxes."
Not make a loss on my rental property investment after higher interest rates....
"Tenants do not appreciate the government taxes paid by the landlord. In the UK rates, water, sewerage and electric are all paid by the tenant who actually uses it,"
Manadotory rent stop payments on outstanding maintenance and instant prosecution on unlawful entry
"If a tenant is prepared to offer additional bond (on top of the regulated amount) to increase an owners incentive to accept them with pets, this should be allowable."
Random inspections of households of renters independent of agents to confirm that all agencies are maintaining the same level of standards of health and safety and security etc.
Standard for entry condition report to be completed by agency
I would make it that - judges / magistrates had to follow the legislation and not just  ignore the legislation especially when it had been followed correctly. then they continue on to make judgements  they think is suitable. Not much point in having legislation when this happens.
changing the bias of QCAT magistrates towards tenants who are usually there for a good reason like leaving the property unfit for a quality next tenant and unpaid downtime which they not being accountable for. They never leave the place as they started the tenancy and judges dont address that.
"Having no grey areas in the Act.   
Having more distinctive legislation to be able to promptly and clearly give advice  "
As a Business Owner who has 2 Offices that equate to several hundred managements I feel that a lot needs to be said about the Renting Experience.
Inspections every 6 months instead of 4
Carpets and pest inspections- I feel tenants must have the carpets professionally cleaned when they vacate and if they do have pest they must have a professional do the pest inspection rather then just bomb flea it themselves. 
Landlords should have more access to their properties
The real estate hold all the power when you leave the property as they hold the bond. I have often had experiences when I leave a property better than I find it they still pick you up on something.
I have had an experience where accidental damage happened. A ceramic cooktop was accidentally cracked and reported to complex manager. It was explained to me that the owners had landlord insurance but because the excess was high I had to replace the cooktop at my cost. I don't agree that in the case of accidental damage the tenant should have to pay if there is insurance in place. If the insurance is not going to be used why have they got a policy and not use it?
Bond doesn't cover the cost of repairs if a tenant damages walls carpets etc.
Change the law so that bond can't be used by tenants as final 4 weeks rent and then they still leave costs such as cleaning and damage.
"As a landlord, we need an increased ability to recover monies from tenants that have either left a property owing money. Ie: I’ve had a tenant stop paying rent for six weeks. He left the property in a shambles. Even though I have insurance cover, and his bond was awarded to me through QCAT, I was still left hundreds of dollars out of pocket, and because he’s a recipient of welfare, QCAT were unable to enforce an order that he pay those expenses.

Further to that, the consequences for his actions need to be more severe. A three year listing on TICA is insufficient. It should be ten years."
More balanced rights between landlord and tenants as the legislation is weighted in favour of the tenant.
The definition of fair wair and tear.
"More public housing generally.
More small rental properties particularly for single people. 
More simple basic accommodation options so as to get rid of the waiting list for public housing."
The ability to decorate ie hang pictures. Or upgrade fixtures to improve living space. 
Transferring Bonds. Having to continually pull funds to pay a bond then refund then bond. Just maintain it once
"Longer, stronger leases"
"Property owners who manage their own rentals & do not understand their obligations under state legislation, they should have to sit a course before they are allowed to manage their own properties."
"The Continuous rising rent Costs,Bullying from Agents,Complete unaffordability,Lack of Pet Friendly Rentals that aren't in places like Pimpama and Coomera that are to far away from my Job."
"Availability of longer lease terms, say 10 years or more, with rent increases limited to less than 5% per annum. "
Change laws to allow properties to be sold when necessary
"Owners must produce photos taken of house at time of renting, and must disclose all problems, faults and floors. If they do not, tenants have the right to stop paying rent until fixed and or terminate the lease without penalties. Landlords need to be held accountable whether or not they live close to property."
The Landlord has more say over their own properties.
"Remove uncertainty around negative gearing, investment loans, and stamp duty are removed so investors can continue to provide good qualify accommodation to renters.

Allow owners to remove tenants that are considered unsuitable and allow market forces to control rent increases rather than imposing artificial controls.

"
How real estate agents sell their clients to other real estate agents.
Tighten rules on tenents who do not do the right thing .eg cause major damage to property above & beyond the Bond held.
Landlords actually fixing things that you have spoken to the Real estate several times. 
"Less invasion of privacy as a renter, as a landlord, the fickle complaints are frustrating e.g. blown lightbulb that landlord must supply a ladder & training so tenant can change a light bulb is ridiculous."
Real estate agents should not get the first two weeks rent of a tenancy agreement because it encourages the agencies to move tenants on after each lease.
"Lack of compensation/rights when an owner wants to do renovations or open houses to sell their property. Tenants are expected to clean the house and leave the premises whenever the owner wants to show the home, and as long as they get give notice the owner has little practical say."
"Tenancy rights. I was being harassed by the estate agent at the end of my tenancy. After my child was taken they had no respect for me and gave me 90 days to vacate, increased the tent twice and forced frequent inspections including showing prospective Tennant's through without notice. When I finally moved, they tried to claim my entire bond under false accusations and gave me a bad renting reference so I could not gain another rental lease. When I complained to the Qld human rights rights Commission they claimed my complaint was not valid.

I'd like to see protection  for people in crisis during rental tenancies. The estate agent was cruel to me forcing me to renew my lease immediately. When I could not renew the lease they just evicted me. I felt it was very cruel treatment as I had been renting the long term home for nearly 4 years.

I also believe Tennant's should be allowed to have pets regardless. Rental homes are depreciating homes. This means they will always require some upkeep work. Having pets is a comfort that everyone should be able to enjoy whether they are home owners or not. Renters are disadvantaged by the fact they rent a home rather than buy it. I am someone effectively unable to work and perpetually receiving welfare. I will never be able to afford to buy a home but I should be entitled to my human rights as a renter. One of those is to house a comfort animal and pet. Because I am always refused  to have a pet, my quality of life is reduced.

I also feel that renters should be entitled to move their belongings to their rented space.

At the gold coast there are hundreds of sub let rooms which refuse Tennant's to move in all their belongings. These are boarding houses which trap people such as myself into unsuitable tenancies.

I think long term renters should be eligible for housing support and assistance to move into low cost housing. I do not feel it is fair that I spend 2/3 of my weekly income on rent."
Reduce absorbent rates.

Constantly having to have smoke alarms checked and tested
"Ability to turn down inspection times that don't suit and to negotiate a time that does suit me. The ability to have pets! This is a huge thing. It is so unfair not being able to have the joy and companionship of a pet just because you cannot afford to buy a ridiculously expensive house for yourself. Ability to hang pictures and secure furniture. Happy to have a fair price of repairing this taken out of the bond upon vacating. Private real estates and landlords should accept bond loans and bond transfers as it is hard for some people doing it tough to afford to pay a large bond especially students, single parents, unemployed and pensioners. This only contributes to homelessness."
Faster enforcement of residential tenancy act legislation so that a) rental properties are always safe and in good repair and b) any substantial damage to the property by tenants or costs incurred by the lessors due to tenants' behaviour can be accessed by the lessor via enactment of the relevant legislation   
"Property managers should be held more responsible, bad advice given to tenants and landlords"
"No need to ask for pets, Allowance for rental agreements longer than 1 year, with options for up to 5+ years. Ability to make changes to the property like painting a room."
"Tougher expectations on tenants. Too many properties are getting destroyed, rent in arrears and people disrespecting the home owners. "
Have inspections 6 monthly not 3 monthly.
Lower rent prices.
"Better house inspections/warning letters. 
These questions are very broad. "
Tenants need TK maintain the rental property with respect and keep it clean
"I am landlord and whenever there is a repair required, the quotes obtained by the agents are typically a lot higher than what you normally get. There should be a better an easier way to penalize the agent for not acting on the best interest of the owner when getting quotes for repairs. "
"Better property managers, more control over what we can and can't do to our houses which are very expensive assets."
The cost. Renting in QLD is far too expensive for run down homes that are not in a satisfactory condition owned by people who really have no interest in maintaining their investment property to a reasonable standard. 
Stop rogue Agents removing bonds with no evidence.  Good renters need to be treated with respect.
Make tenants more accountable by being able to prosecute via the criminal courts for delinquent behaviour or malicious damage.

Not allow the agents to take photos in every room when they do an inspection they should only take photos if there is damage
"Tenants should pay for the Sewerage Usage Charge where this is a service charge. ie it is a linked directly to the water use, usually 80% of water use. the tenant uses more water and the sewage service charge increases accordingly
"
"'- If long term renter i.e. 10yrs+ be given opportunity to rent to buy property
- Property managers held accountable to ensure requested repairs etc. are attended to quickly."
Real Estate's in QLD need to realise that without tenants they only have half a business or even less - I have lived in 4 states and QLD is the only one where I have been treated poorly.  Real Estate's need to start treating tenants with respect - some tenants choose to rent and not buy.
"Provide a website where landlords and tenants can both rate their experience with each other - kind of like how Ebay does it. 

This would help the landlord choose good tenants and help the tenant choose a good landlord."

"Stop renting,u the return is no worth the hassle and property damage."
"Not enough support and guidance for tenants.  At my last rental property my landlord never lodged my bond and at the end of my tenancy keep my bond for no reason.  If i had better guidance that may not have happened  to me. Also, i have rented with real estates and moved into places that were un cleaned prior to me moving in, at the end of the tenancy, they expected it to be perfect or they would keep my bond."
"I wish that we could treat our rental property more like our own home. It makes me sad that I can't hang photos on the wall because we aren't allowed to put hooks up and that my son can't play outside because there is no fence and we aren't allowed to build one.
There are also things that have not been right in our house that we have just had to learn to deal with. For example, there's no rangehood in the kitchen, so we have to open all the windows and doors when we cook. We asked the property manager about having one installed and she said that the owner would allow us to as long as it was a brand new one professionally installed by an electrician and that we would have to pay for it.
We have a door that won't close because the house shifted structurally after they replaced the posts under the house. It's very frustrating because the property manager said that she would have a look at it during the next inspection but she hasn't inspected the property for about 18 months now (and she lives onsite)."
Faster evictions. Agreements need to be clearer re tenant responsibilities and consequences.
"Rights of landlord need some defence. On a number of occasions tenants have damaged property well beyond the bond available and/or departed owing rent. Capital gains on property near Gladstone have vanished, so there is a net loss. In many instances it has been impossible to evict tenants even when clauses of the lease are broken eg. additional tenants beyond shown, large dogs doing damage, drug and domestic violence offences on which Police will not give any formal advice."
Make tenants more accountable for their actions when they rent. They often cause damage that is often more than the bond and the QCAT process is slow and biased  towards the tennant.
"More accountability for landlords, an easier conflict resolution process"
"Rental property managers demonstrating respect, honesty, professionalism, efficiency and treating us as ""Clients"" rather than a source of money."
Tenants should not be allowed to treat a rental property as their own. They do not have any interest or entitlement to a rental property. 
Tenants should have more freedom in how they make rent payments. Property managers are currently pushing tenants to sign up with a 3rd party to charge fees on rent payments and only offering outdated payment methods such as cheque and money order as an alternative. In my experience the property managers will even make offers in breach of the current tenancy act.
People's attitude to renters
"Longer term (e.g 5 year) leases for tentants who wish to stay.

Real estates listening to what tenants have to say and not trying to take money away from tenants because they think can get away with it.
Id stop owners from imposing that tenants sign a new lease once it is near an end and not allowing tenants to move onto periodic agreements through bulling tenants with threats of terminating a tenancy if one does not sign a new lease. 
"tenants should be treated as equal citizens particularly if they are good tenants, look after the property, pay rent and water costs regularly etc"
"Needs to be some regulation regarding Landlord/Owners/rental Managers from charging high Rent for Sub-standard units or units that do not have A/C, Remote opening garage Doors, Ceiling Fans, Sub-standard Carpets, faulty flyScreens, faulty plumbing, etc....also just because a unit has a good view seems to be an excuse to have high rents this should not allowed."
"As a renter, I feel undervalued. Real estate agents always feel like they are working against you."
Having a proper black list for bad tenants available to all rental managers.
signing locked in contracts . situations change and you have to pay thousands of dollars for a place you don't even live in
Fairer and more equitable rights between lessors and tenants
"COST AND LAWS THAT PROTECT RENTERS AND LAWS THAT PROTECTS RENTERS WHO LOST THEIR JOBS, LAWS THAT PROTECT THE UNEMPLOYED RENTERS
Firstly, the Cost of renting is way too excessive for families
Families are paying $800-$900  for properties that cost only $60,000 to build
There needs to be a thorough Justified balance between the actual cost of the property and what owners require for rent, from my family's personal experience in the past rental property in Queensland has been very unfair and unbalanced.
Secondly, the RENT IS ALWAYS IN FAVOUR OF THE OWNERS NEVER THE RENTERS, all those leases we sign are all geared towards protecting the owners and not the renters, renters are merely perceived as Slaves to complete the mortgage of the owner who in the first place cannot afford to pay outright for the property. Let us be FAIR, please."
Both tenants and owners should feel safe
"The restrictions placed on owners looking for a certain clientele make us owners look like we are discriminating when in reality there can be some very good reasons. Eg the acceptance of a young toddlers in a townhouse with limited play areas, stairs and no kid proof cupboards. Body corporates should have the right to say no pets especially when yapping dogs/wailing cats disturb the peaceful setting."
Better rights for renters with pets. It can be so difficult to find a rental property that is pet friendly and this absolutely must change. 
"Allowing pets
Having onsite manager on premises when tradesman are in house"
Make it easier to evict tenants
Not allow renting sight unseen. 
Not having to seek approval for pets - when applying for rental properties we were constantly turned down for having pets despite having an excellent application
"Ruling around response times from owners for when things must be fixed by and if they don’t fix things then ways to break a lease without penalty. Eg if there is a bit of plumbing needing fixing and the owner hasn’t fixed it after 2 weeks, you should be able to leave without penalty. "
"I hate that real estate agent can send a 'Notice To Leave' with a new rental agreement. And, if you don't sign the new are agreement by the due date they threaten to enforce the Notice to leave and state they will refuse any signed rental agreement sent late i.e. after the date they stated it must be returned.    "
Currently no concerns with our rental property 
"Make real eststes
And owners accountable "
Tenants that are trashing your property have more rights that landlords. If you rate them poorly (as you should) they are stuck with you longer causing more problems and expenses.
Better training for Property Managers - some of them are completely useless
"Some ""Property Managers"" seem to have total disregard towards their tenants."
"Installation of Air conditioning. It gets to 38c in summer in my unit.  I've asked the owner twice and even offered to go halves and they've said no, as the unit would need to be rewired. The second time I asked I received a very curt response advising this had already been addressed in my previous request."
Make the process easier to get repairs done by landlords where these are necessary.
That tenants with pets would take more responsibility for the damage pets cause to properties 
Greater control over damage
longer leases and no no ground evictions
"The availability of information on rights, everything is very generic and open to interpretation. Even calling through you get very general information, it would be great to be able to find out specific answers to a specific situation"
Getting a faster response time for repairs/maintenance on the property.  This doesn't mean the landlord is necessarily the slower respondent.  I may the the property manager not passing the information on.
"that as  a owner I should have access to tenant pass renting records that is financial that they pay their rent, and how they treat the property ."
Greater ability to interact with the rental system online for bond etc. 
Getting longer term tenants
Faster repair works not waiting for 3 plus weeks 
Not being railroaded into allowing tenants to do as they please.
Make it easier to have pets.  Enable longer leases. Ensure repairs are done and on time. Reduce inspection frequency.  Make it harder for landlords to visit unannounced.
Introduce minimum standards for property management by rental agents
A single application form to complete which all agents must accept. 
Realistic rental prices for properties
Rental increases limited to 1 per year.
If they can mandate heaters in the cooler southern states why can't you mandate Air Con in the hotter Northern states
The relationship balance between lessor and tenant has swung too far in favour of the lessor making access to affordable and safe housing difficult for some tenants. This needs to be addressed in the legislation. 
Not having the rent increase every time that the contract comes up for renewal
Tenants being held more accountable for damage caused at properties.
"1.In a civilized country it should not be allowed for landlords or agents to evict tenants
without giving a reason.
2.Very disturbing and unnecessary are the every few months inspections.
3. Taking photos of my possessions without permission."
More decent properties that allow pets not the ridiculous low standard houses now.
Offering longer leases for good tenants so you can have some security... i.e. 2 or 3 year leases.
"Better customer service from real estate agents.  I own a rental property but also rent myself and have had bad experiences with real estate agents.  

As a tenant I have had to submit a complete application in order to just be able to do an inspection which I thought was very unreasonable.  I was also reported to the RTA for being one week late in my rental payments without them contacting me about it - it was a mistake not intentional that I hadn't made the payment and I corrected it as soon as I found out but now it will be on my rental record.  They also told me they were going to complete work in the garden which they did not and then told me I had to clean up the garden conveniently forgetting that it was a mess when I moved it. 

Then as a property owner, I have had my agent stuff my tenants around over a $20 door nob and not acting on the TV antenna being broken for months despite me clearing them to complete repairs under a certain price being done without checking with me first - they hadn't even gotten quote until I told them too so they didn't know the cost was only $130.  Then on repairs that I did have done were done not to specification and they didn't tell me for months and they also charge me for repairs for a problem that was clearly due to the tenants damaging my house.  My agent has provided poor service both to my tenants and also to myself. In researching alternative agents it seems most feel actually having to do something for the property is a burden and minimise how much they do for you.  For example they all charge extra fees on top of their commission for 'admin' and/or an annual statement - given this is their job I don't see how they can justify adding a fee.

(By the way when I say that tenants don't generally treat rental properties as their own home, I don't mean that they necessarily mistreat it - but it is definitely different)

"
Make sure the owners are not penalised by rulings which allow poor tenants to remain and continue to damage property
Reduced ‘inspections’ for tenants like us who have never caused issue
The rights of the landlord at least equal to the rights of the tenant
no pets allowed if we say no . if we own the property we have a right to say no.
Being able to have pets and have pet friendly common areas 
Give owners and tenants the same termination periods
"Having longer lease terms, not 6month leases "
Longer time between inspections and minor modifications allowed
Being allowed to make the house more of a home...adding personal touches to walls etc and moving inspections to 6 monthly
Realistic expectations around the exit inspection. Have rented a new home both times and property manager expected it returned to as new after being lived in- expected whole walls to be painted when there was a small blemish which had to be patched. Twice we had a big chunk of bond taken. Acceptable wear and tear in a new property doesn't seem to exist
Be able to given tenants only 1 month notice to evict. And require a tenant to also give at least 1 month notice to leave.
do not let people have animals when renting unless they pay a fee for cleaning up 
"Honestly, legislative reform so that multi-tentant shared tenancies are accounted for by the legislation, so that people are responsible for themselves, to prevent the constant shirking of individual responsibility to leave it to the person who cleans up after the slob. Yes, it's personal."
"The real estate business should not be the people to judge for bond cleaning. They obviously make money from deciding a place isn't clean enough, even when it is"
Number of referees required. Landlords requesting less personal info about bank accounts 
Tennants to be more accountable for wear and tear and general cleanliness of homes while they are renting.
Property Managers to do better inspections of the property.  3 months is far too long in between inspections to ensure that there are no major repairs that the tenant has not reported and to ensure that the property maintenance is kept up to date.  A lot can happen in between inspections and the tenants do not inform the property managers of a lot maintenance issues. 
"Owners need to have the ongoing right to refuse pets in Rental Properties.
Owner should have ongoing right to be able to terminate a tenancy at their discretion if need be.
Owner needs to have ongoing right to be able to decline modifications to the property by the tenant.
"
Making it more like a home such as having pets and being able to hang art
"Direct steps the renter can take to actively prevent the landlord from just ""turning up"". He lives local and thumbs his nose at the rules, as he just arrives randomly. Even the agent says to him he shouldn't, and he ignores the agent too!"
Less frequent inspections - inspections every 3 months are too frequent.
"As a landlord I believe the condition and cleanness of the property needs to be addressed So a smoother change over of tenants is possible.
 "
There are too many inspections/maintenance and too much time allocated for those inspections
"Lease periods and increases, 6 month leases seem to be common, you can't sign up for a 24 month plan for internet, power, phone or anything else."
Recent experience had been very well managed. 
Ensure the rights of landlords are protected for properties they ‘own’ and laws and protections are more evenly balanced. 
more direct communication between tenants and owners.
Fewer inspections and would appreciate feedback after an inspection. 
Lease timeframes being more flexible ie. where we have tenanted properties previously for 12+ months and requested the option of a periodic lease thereafter due to change of circumstances (baby) and the request has not been honoured.  
Getting things fixed on time 
Minimum standards for safety
Less frequent inspections
As a landlord I'd like more opportunities to get tenants to pay for damage to property. My tenants had moved out and it was several weeks before the new tenants advised the carpets smelt because the previous tenants had allowed their cat to pee in every room. The old tenants had already had their bond back and refused to cover costs to replace the carpets.
Less property inspections
"Leasing agents need to have more compassion, manners and let you know your rental is being sold."
"Stronger rights for landlords who outlay significant amounts of money and, hence, financial risk, to invest in property and have tenants mistreat that investment. "
the land lords need to do repairs a lot quicker 
I would like landlords and body corporates give tenants fair chance to prove they will be responsible tenants. Even with a pet.  
Less of the blame directed at tenants if things break or stop working. Actually using common sense to determine what is wear and tear and not expecting things to remain the same as they were when they were purchased many years before
Prices of rental properties and condition of rental properties
Property managers should treat tenants with respect not disdain
"I rent through Re/Max and they do not allow me to pay via bank dir` debit , any option they show costs me to pay my rent
I have taken a remac card it costs me $9.60 per quarter to pay my rent , if I went into office each time and pay over the counter it also costs me , they show benifits of card when you shop so much off , But I do not need or want it as a pensioner , most annoying"
"Value for rental accommodation.
Landlords are expecting top dollar for housing that is in poor condition. 
Should have a governing body to assess condition to rental price being asked."
Housing needs to confirm to  a minimum standard
"We are both renting and am satisfied with how we are being treated and work with the Landlord if things need attending to.
We are also landlords and up until recently have had no problems with tenants until a recent new tenant whom from 1st week was going to be a problem.
Rent now not being paid and if this continues will cause us financial hardship. Landlords need to be to address these matters quickly to move tenants out. 
 "
Prevent pets in unit blocks
"make it law that to rent a house in QLD that house must have at least a 5kw solar system 

to help pay the rent it would be a good idea for the government to increase the rent assist  payment  and built a lot more smoke and drug-free public housing with a lot  less red tape if you need a house to get better or to access work there should all ways be one available  with or without a yard "
The ability to put minor changes eg hooks and furniture safety stability fitting for furniture and pet
"Houses are in urgent need to comply for minimum standards due to landlords and rental agents taking complete advantage of tenants who cant  afford the high rents.
"
"Length of lease, no security of tenure with the current lease lengths"
Shorten notice periods where tenants not paying rent or damaging property
More regular inspections with owner present.
When tenants damage the property that owners have more rights to get their out of pocket money back. 
More education for renters for rights and responsibilities 
Rent that does not increase. With a aged pension of $800 a fortnight the rent must remain stable so we don't have to keep moving to be able to rent and have money over for living expenses.This is urgent.
Currently the rules favour the tenants so much.
"Pets allowed
Repairs to be made asap 
The ability to add shelving and adding locks to doors, adding air come etc"
Tenants be held more responsible for damages to property through neglect 
As an owner they is limited protection for owners when their tenants falls behind in rent or cause problems with other tenants
 I don't think they should be allowed to raise the rent it should stay at the price it started at.
The fact that you can live in a house with your children for 5 years. Pay $400 pw in rent for a basic 3-4 bedroom home. And then you are expected to give the property back like you didnt live there. Its kind of like renting a car and them expecting you to put the km back. 
Restricted number of open houses when property is listed for sale or the option to vacate without punishment.
More freedom to do as we wish within the house and on the property.
"The rental amount is too much and it is a struggle. My rent went up $45 pw in one hit, from $355 to $400, in part because the owners were selling and wanted it to look enticing to prospective buyers. The property is 18 years old, but because a lot of new units have been built in the area my unit rental went up because of what they cost to rent. I have no AC.

I still get inspections every 16 weeks, even though I have been here over 16 years. I feel it is a constant intrusion on my privacy, they can see I am not damaging the place and I even have things in place to prevent damage to walls, etc. as much as possible. "
"Stop politicians from interferring in the market dynamics.
If politicians think they are better after off looking after one particular group then it should not be at the cost of tax payers or other groups.
On this rent reform agenda, hands off. Too much control and interference. Note that government is elected for a limited period and hence it cannot play with the life of people who live much londer"
Recognition of good tenancy and reward with less frequent inspections. 
Not adding on water rates but including in rent; this is just a sneaky way of increasing rent . Plus no problem having pets so long as all dogs outside & locked up at night (re native wildlife) & cats inside at night  (also re nativevanimald)
"The landlord to properly clean the rental via a bond cleaner before leasing it again. I own multiple properties in the USA and after each tenant, I -re-key all locks, send in a handyman to fix any issues, steam clean the carpets and repaint or touch up the walls. "
How your bond money is passed over when your lease is finished
"Greater accountability for property managers with regards to the conditions of the home and the time of selling a new lease. Too many homes in poor conditions but with only a 10 minute to view the property, renters have very little time to really see what they're potentially signing up for. "
Making rental properties easier for single parents to obtain.
Higher Bonds more security for owners
Better training for managing agents
"Having to wait all day or rental inspections an tradesman , in this day an age a 2 hours window is all that should be allowed , to have to take a day off work every 3months for an inspections in not on"
"Allow pets, allow my family to hang pictures on the wall, stop constant inspections "
"I believe it should be easier for tenants to have pets in their home. The amount of properties which allow pets compared to how many families have pets, sometimes this means families have to give up their pets just to have a place to live. "
"The unrealistic expectation that a property must be returned in the exact same condition as when it was first rented.
I dont mean that major damage should not be repaired but minor things like makeed walls/carpets or crinkled curtains  have to be expected when you are paying good money to use the proprty 24/7."
"controls on property managers to stop overstepping will on a power trip, maybe an appeal system when the tenant feels hard done by"
"Allow pets. As someone with mental health issues, I NEED my cat. But, finding a place to live, is nearly impossible."
"Bond rules, real estates"
Bring back the law where if landlords don’t fix maintenance issues the tenants rent is reduced or they don’t have to pay all together.
Quicker bond refunds
I would place a requirement on property managers to train their staff in the management of properties. All to often the staff are inexperienced and unknowledgeable about the needs of the property owner. For the money that property managers charge we are getting a second rate service.
"The excess taking if indiscriminate photos of living arrangements and possessions. Agency inspectord often sub 25yo females (selfie culture) snap away everything....  over 40 photos taken in a few minutes. I questioned the girl and was told quite rudely in my face that they are allowed to and Im just a tenant.

When I first leased the prooerty I was tokd pictures would be taken of issues or damage that required attention and efforts would be made to omit possessions. Clearly not the case. I asked to see the pictures and omit what I didn't like .... no chance.

This type of treatment is an invasion of privacy.  Is impersonal. Is concerning when pictures can be shared so easily.

I contested the agency at numerous levels..... no support and no-one cared as they had ""the right""."
More feedback from real estate agents.
More flexible leasing arrangements.
the rights of the renter - being able to have a real estate make the owner fix something within the property that is unsafe to live
"Has been horrendous with some tenants, and the difficulty in getting them out of the house"
"I would sell if I could, it is an awful experience and so expensive to own a rental property (unfortunately to sell right now I would lose $40 - $60k which I just can't afford to do."
Landlords should be held accountable for unmaintained properties. Too many investors cannot afford to be landlords
I would feel more secure and I think it would benefit both parties if we had longer term leases in Queensland
More flexibility in lease options
"If a tenant has lived in a rental property for more than a year, and they are a good tenant who takes care of the property, then inspections should be shaved back to every six months. I lived in a rental property for 6 years and took care of it like it was my own. Agents even used to say 'we dont know why we come here - this place is always immaculate and well cared for.' But they kept coming every three months anyway. I personally feel this is wrong."
"Agencies have been very difficult when it comes to resolving maintenance issues, they forget that the renter is also a customer not just the owners they represent. Agencies should be able to facilitate both relationships. Penalty should be imposed on owners for not resolving maintenance issues i.e reduced rent and customer satisfaction results."
When things need to be done around the house they get onto it straight away before the problem becomes bigger which it has many times over the years in this one house..
Stop Agents using the ruse that they are selling the property and doing multiple inspections to try and get you to end your lease even going to court and telling the magistrate that the property was being sold and not renewing your lease. Then once you have moved out leasing the property immediately.
"As a tenant, I feel like there is no one to discuss landlord issues with"
Inspection & Enrty issues.
"ALL was OK. We were only in rental accommodation (one townhouse and one villa) for 12 months, before buying a home.
Now currently own two rental properties which we rent out privately."
"More rights for tenants to be able to hold landlords accountable for keeping homes in good repair. 
More rights for landlords to be able to get rid of bad tenants quicker before to much damage is done to homes.  "
"The right to call a house your home.  Renters are considered 2nd class citizens, and we are given few rights.  There are so many issues, but I will give a few examples.  It seems that everything favours the Landlord.  In one of our previous houses (we have moved three times in the last four years) we were asked to sign another lease after we had lived there for one year.  The problem with having to sign a lease every year is that you are not free to look for another house.  When we chose not to sign, we were asked to vacate the house.  We were given two months, which forced us to move into a house which was below our standard.  In the present house, the house had a pool and solar panels.  Because the pool needed repair, the owner decided it was cheaper to fill it in, even though this was not communicated to us when we signed the lease.  The solar panels do not work, but the owner has decided it is too expensive to fix.  The carpets need replacing, but again, the owner doesn't seem concerned.  "
Improve the balance between tenant and rental property owner interests.
The procedure for dealing with violations of BC Bye Laws particularly parking issues.  The current system is incredibly convoluted and painstaking.
"Attitude of real estate agents, not default negative and unreasonable.  "
Have a way of ensuring reported problems get fixed. 
To have the opportunity of long-term rental with rental increases limited to CPI.  For me long-term residential rental is not 12 months or even 24 months.  My wife and I would prefer to have the opportunity of renting our home for at least 3 years; 5 years would be even better!
More ownership on Tenant's to fix damage. Bond should be more than 4 weeks rent (similar to Victoria)
Stricter rules for repairs back to condition on occupation.
Have Tenants be held responsible for the damage they cause to Property.
Reduce number of inspections during tenancy
Being treated with respect from the agent. When the property goes up for sale the Tennant should have the right to move out instead of being subjected to open house inspections. This is a huge invasion of privacy and incredibly inconvenience when you both work full-time and only have your weekends free.
"Too many rental inspections and 7 days is not enough notice. Every 12 weeks I have rental inspections, they only give 7 days notice (I work 6 of those days) and instead of being just a walkthrough routine inspection, it’s always a very detailed inspection like an exit clean. Too unrealistic and not enough privacy. Make it 1 inspection per year with at least 4 weeks notice. People live busy lives with kids and events."
"Professional and adequately qualified property managers
Committee to be formed to review misconduct of property managers
Review of ""Notice to Leave without grounds""
Comprehensive & transparent water charge invoices to be issued by property managers "
Ability to provide longer term leases eg 2 years +
"Better security in terms of knowing where I will be living in 6,12,24 months time."
"Notice periods for ending tenancies, professional cleaning including carpets upon exit of properties only if it was done prior to entry. tougher procedures for rent arrears because we loose a lot of money with the current process due to taking a longtime to evict tenants and then they don't leave the property clean and the bond doesn't even cover the lost rent and we have to pay for cleaning/mowing etc and this has to be done before we can get new tenants in."
"I'm a landlord and I own two properties in Queensland and I disagree that my rights as a landlord should be taken away from me as I've had bad tennents in the past and it is very hard to get rid of them as the law stands now. If the laws change to allow pets, tennents to make changes to my property without my consent, and I can't terminate the tenancy lease at my discression, the potential for damage to my property could go well into the thousands and my insurance won't cover it leaving me out of pocket and could also leave a lot of ladlords in financial difficulty whilst they try to fix their property out of their own pocket without income comming in. Also potential changes tennants make to the property without my permission could result in devaluing my property which I will have to fix prior to selling it or ask for a lower price at sale and loose future rental income."
Limiting number to tenants according to number of rooms 
"Option to provide a larger bond that allows pictures & minor approved changes, that the bond would cover"
Communication with landlords and property manager when things urgantly need fixing.
Fairer outcomes for Landlords when tenants leave the property in a poor state.
"We have had tenants trash our property and the bond did not pay for much of the repairs, about 1 tenth. Subsequent legal action proved fruitless and the tenant was in another rental within 1 week of vacating my property. "
needed repairs being done.
Entry and exit reports to be compulsory and if not completed by either party correctly than no excuse when at the end os a lease.
Communication between tenant and landlord
Greater clarity and understanding of rules as well as power for both landlords and tennants
"On a Periodic Agreement a tenant can give Landlord just 2 weeks notice to vacate but a Landlord needs to give tenant 2 months to vacate.  This is a bit unfair.  Tenant and Landlord should be on an equal ""playing field""."
Better protection for property owners needed and more stable and longer tenancy agreements with longer notice periods and more responsibities needed for tenants e. g. being responsible for smoke alarms totally as they tend to temper with them frequently.  More avenues needed for owners protection as well as higher bond amount if something does go wrong. 
"Only thing?? there is a list of tenants that shows what sort of tenant you are. Landlords and real estate agents can update this list depending on their experience of the tenant.  To make it fair, can we PLEASE have a similar list of real estate agents and landlords available to tenants and prospective tenants. There are some awful real estate agents and landlords out there that you would not recommend to anyone. But rentals in my area are limited so we have to put up with whomever we get. There have been a couple of tenancies I have been involved in when I would have appreciated knowing what the lessor or real estate agent was like to deal with. It would have saved me stress and alot of money. This is fair. It also might make the real estate agent lift their game because there are some agents out there that take advantage of the fact that there is limited choice for renters and treat renters very poorly.  When you are a good tenant, and you know it, and you work hard to be a good tenant, it is very unfair to be treated like this."
Improve communication between tenant and landlord
"Having rental agencies held accountable for not providing agreed services to landlords. Almost all agencies I have used as a landlord failed significantly to ensure my property was maintained in a reasonable condition by the tenant during the course of the lease ie they either didn't complete property inspections when they should have or didn't complete a thorough inspection which meant significant damage was only identified when I inspected the property after the tenant vacated. Examples are a 2 year old stove that needed replacement due to damage caused by cockroach infestation, carpet damage that required chemical specialists to remove odours from 4 cats that urinated in the bedroom during a year long lease. I had to pay out of my own pocket for each repair (I did have landlord insurance but couldn't make a claim). I identified both situations even though the rental agency was charging me fees each month to 'manage' the property on my behalf. They weren't penalised whatsoever. There was no consequence for them. It was simply free money they took from me without providing the service it was supposed to cover."
"Being able to have long-term rental options, e.g.  5yrs - 10yrs. "
Once passed a year of house inspection then maybe just do a annual house inspection instead of continuing a house inspection every 3 months
Maintenance requests and unfair cleaning demands at exit. 
More help with RTA lines - most consistent answers 
How landlords look after their properties and the attitude taken to renters
Guidelines need to me more forward not so grey area
"as a Property Manager - clearer legislation for QCAT matters - adjudicators have too much power to make their own rules and it feels like a lottery entering a hearing, even if you have followed legislation to a T"
Being able to find effective and efficient property manager in my area that is fair to both the tenant and the landlord.
"More power to the owner to enforce what is in the lease agreement , ie  rent paid on time,  property kept tidy,  pets as agreed upon in lease agreement.  "
"That the real estate pass on vital information to the landlord.
Communication is awful. 
I asked if i could paint a bedroom as it hadnt been done in 20 years by the look of it.... and 6 months later i still didnt get an answer, its frustrating. 
I could have saved the landlord money on a stove but the real estate didnt pass on the message."
The way you are treated by real estate agents. 
Lack of pet friendly rentals
Longer standard lease terms for more stability.
"As a landlord, more protection against damage. 
With unfenced houses, the right to refuse pets that can roam & kill native birds & animals, & harass nearby residents and visitors."
Improved property management services and reporting.
"As a property owner I feel that I have little to no rights in terms of protecting my investment.  If the tenant damages the house, is late on rent / dose not  pay rent etc  The time and cost to remove them is not covered by the bond and takes far too long.  Not paying / being late is stealing but seen as acceptable / tolerated within their rights.  I was told that I was because they were between jobs - yet if they went to the supermarket and walked out with a loaf of bread without paying its stealing and not acceptable - I can miss Thousands of dollars and I neede to understand their situation..."
Less financial outlays
"Make the tenant more responsible for pay rent on time, and for them to pay their fair share of water invoice.  If tenant takes off without paying due rent then there must be penalties. Current system allow tenants to remain in property even after receiving the first breach notice, then not pay rent and use up the bond, then depart the property with out cleaning or taking rubbish with them. "
More access to properties that allow pets 
Improvements that reduce energy costs like solar energy.
More rights for tenants when maintenance is not being carried out
"There is very little protection for property owners under current legislation. In a recent personal experience with a property manager where their performance was poor and negligent, we had nowhere to turn except taking them to court. The RTA is for tenants. The REIQ actually has no power to do anything at the end of the day, and their timeframes are extremely tight. It appears as though there is plenty of assistance and protection for tenants and property managers, but if you own a tenanted property and have a dispute, your only option is to seek legal counsel which is expensive. This is extremely unfair and needs to be addressed."
Let an independent body set rents
Make it easier to evict tenants who fail to pay rent and refuse to leave until a court order is obtained. This allows them to damage the property in the time it takes to evict them.
"Pets Requests - Don't feel the Body Corporate Committee should have the right to approve or decline these requests, from tenants and also owners. "
Regular checks to ensure rental properties are safe and in liveable condition and the cost of rent is approiate to the accommodation offered. 
"1. We look after you, you look after us. We maintain our properties well to hopefully attract & keep better, longer, satisfied tenants. As the owner, we rent for  financial reasons and WE don't have the option of just walking away. Make the tenant more accountable for damages and loss of income by means of larger rental deposits, shorter & more simplistic eviction processes, improved ""black listing"" options, etc.
A credit rating exists for owners and needs to also better exist for renters. Defaulting on a rental payment is no different to defaulting on a loan payment.

2. Insurance must cover owners for damages better. For example, if a tenant has a pet then normal insurance ""wear and tear"" is not acceptable when an insurance company blames the pet for the damage and not the tenant. If the tenant has a pet then the tenant must have and provide insurance to cover any damage done. Pets can do more damage than renters. And when as the owner, you don't know how many animals are housed at a property at any time then this is important.

3. Property managers must be more accountable also. It must be easier to hold these people accountable for both renters and owners. For example, keeping sloppy accounting paperwork creates huge angst for both renters and owners. Not completing legal forms that protect tenants and owners which results in monetary loss is acceptable we have found out."
Better communication between landlords and tenants
Streamline maintenance reporting and the process on how it becomes resolved.
Less discrimination around pets being allowed at rental properties 
The process for getting things fixed.
More Rights for Owners Relative to Rent Arrears
"More pet-friendly rentals, cheaper rents for over 50’s, especially single women"
"Tenants to be more accountable for damages 
"
More accountability for tenants who do the wrong thing.
As a property manager it seems like the tenants have a majority of the rights and also when the tenant contacts the RTA and provides incorrect information it make it rather difficult
"Less inspections, we have them every 12 weeks. More freedom to hang or paint, change curtains those types of improvements. Be allowed to have a small pet."
Making sure rental properties meet a specific standard BEFORE they can be rented out.
Notice to vacate at end of lease should be equal times 30 days for both owns/landlords and tenants
"Set a standard of how homes need to be rented.
Carpet should not be more than 20 years old, bathrooms should not be more than 20 years old.
What i am trying to say is that there should be a standard applied to houses that are 15yr or more old and also properties that have been tented for more than 10 years. I pay a premium rent for a house that is 27 years old and the carpet has never been changed and we have carpet beatles and ants. the bathroom vanities are chipboard with water damage and flaking.  There are clearly holes in the grout in the shower and would be doing damage to the slab.
I am a landlord of a house in Victoria and we had to spend $2,000 on it to get it up to standard.
The gold coast rental market is appauling due to the cost of rent and the standard of the houses."
Balance the right of renters and property owners
"Better communication and accountability from real estate agents in advertising a property and managing the property. Rental properties are rarely advertised more than two weeks from the available date (often much less), which makes it very difficult to plan ahead for what is usually a significant change in someone's life. "
Agents being power hungry
Owers stepping up and doing maintenance on there properties 
being more animal friendly. 80% have or want pets. house owners have insurance and bond to cover this and there is no logical reason around why they shouldn't be able to have a pet.
tenants that are of good character and landlords who don't think about the tenants when making decisions
Being treated as a deadbeat even though you have excellent history and after renting on and off for some 30 years treated like I am an idiot when I stick up for myself and exert my rights and once doing so being treated like I have done something wrong.
Giving landlords/agents quicker response times for overdue rent and evictions.
Balance between notice period. 
"6 monthly inspections
not putting rent up every year"
"Property Managers to keep opinions to themselves, and to be taught more about the RTA laws or refresher courses"
Being advised of the rights and obligations of renting.
More consideration to an owner in circumstances where the property is damaged.
I belive real estate agents are pocketing bonds that they claim are required to make good any recitification or cleaning etc.  I believe all real estate agents should produce receipts after the fact to show the RTA that they have in fact made those rectifications and not just banking people's bond!
"Stricter screening processes for renters/ real estate agents.  I don't believe the screening process is as good as it could be.

Too much jargon/paperwork for owners to understand what is allowed/happening etc in the contract."
Clearer understanding about the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and for myself. 
The power landlords and their agents have over removing you from a property if you hold them accountable for repairs - I have not had my lease renewed and been threatened with eviction for speaking up about serious and minor repair and safety problems in properties I have lived in.
Nothing. I was fortunate to rent directly from very ethical and principle landlords.
Regulation for real estate agencies. The ability to make a (free) complaint to a regulatory body about a poor experience. To be treated like a real person.
longer gaps between inspections
Property managers taking more responsibility for tenants that trash your house.
"As a Property Manager, Tenants should have a higher rent to ensure the Owner of the property is covered for damages"
Set standards around completion of routine maintenance items. We have standards for emergencies but routine maintenance even if significant can drag out forever
Better management of maintenance and repairs
Would rather liaise with Property Owners than Real Estate agents.
greater acceptance of pets in rental properties
There are too many inspections allowed. It's disturbing and it's a little violating to be checked in on as often as we are. Plus having an inspection done (in my case) only one month of being at the property... I haven't even settled in and now I need to worry about being judged already if I haven't gotten to putting a bed together or something. 
"Having more frequent inspections than once every six months.
If a tenant is leaving they often do not pay the last few weeks rent thereby negating the opportunity to recover damages from the bond which is expended to pay the unpaid rent."
Tennants to be held more accountable for damage.
"More power to evict bad tenants, quicker
I am a landlord
"
Landlords never seem to fix things unless it is safety related.
Realistic rental prices that aren't governed by greedy real estate agents. 
"Tighter regulation and transparency around rental property managers and the ability for renters to report illegal activity around bonds, rentals and communication between tenants and owners."
"As a retiree able to rent at retirement villages also allowing pets and not focusing on the weight of the dog. Pet owners are usually very aware of been responsible owners also are therapy for elderly, lonely or disabled"
Stop 6 monthly inspections - it's intrusive.  Cap the level that landlords can charge for the rent - I live in a town where children were forced to sleep in the showground (in cars) due to a massive spike in rental charges due to the LNG boom.
Owners and agents don't care if your unhappy because they can always get another renter in so we are constantly fixing and spending our money on things we shouldn't be and have had several houses sold on us and had to fork out for relocating 13 times in 3 years also have had realestate give us a bad name because we gave a bad review which left us homeless for 2 years 
"More available properties suitable for pensioners, with longer leases"
More people skills in all Dept staff
Notice Period to move out
The allowance and keeping of animals
"The RTA giving straight yes or no answers to help renters, instead of referring to text I've already read.
"
The current laws are biased towards tenants. There needs to be a balanced perspective to issues that does not favour one party over the other.
The bias towards tenants when we end up at QCAT. The age of the property is always called into consideration even when it's cleaning items and holes to walls. I understand paint life is 10 years however the owner shouldn't have to pay extra for plastering the walls. 
"
Allowing pets and not allowing properties go up for sale once a lease is signed. "
Create better real estate agents and a better application/viewing process
The rules and guidelines seem to protect tennant more thsn the owner of the property.
An agent who would be more thorough with inspections and tenants who would take reasonable care of my property.  I am tired of being out of pocket thousands of dollars each time a tenant leaves.  landlord insurance does not cover pet damage and this is a major issue.
Owners of rental properties should have the right to terminate a rental agreement at short notice if the renter of the property is found to be falling behind in the rent or not keeping the property in the same condition as the property was leased to them with out going through a lengthy process.
As landlord-develop multi key rental properties 
Rental legislaqtion is currently skewed heavily in favour of the lessee at the great expense of much consideration for the lessor/owner/investor
We have just had a tenant evicted by QCAT for failure to pay rent. It took a month to go to court. In the interim we lost more rent and the tenants and guests trashed our property causing upwards of $20 000 worth of damage. The police say that unless the tenants admit to the crime that they can't be criminally charged and QCAT can't enforce recovery of funds. This is a disgrace and really turns me off being a landlord. 
More security against poor tenants.  Education on respecting a property. 
I'd provide financial incentives for landlords to provide a more eco-friendly housing experience e.g. solar panels on rental properties. This would benefit the tenant by reducing their electrical bills and improve the home value to the landlord. 
More tenants rights in regards to maintenance and pets.
Termination of tenancy agreements being automatic if tenants fall 4 weeks or more behind in rent. This will eliminate bad egg tenants and also the burden on the QCAT system. 
I get charged an extra 85 cents a week to pay my rent as the real estate uses a third party to handle payments. I don't think this is fair. The real estate needs to provide me with a payment option that doesn't cost me anything extra.
Not allow animals in my house.
"Tennants are not paying rent, damaging property and get off without any compensation.  While I have always had a good relationship with tenants of my two units one for 25 years and one for 7 years I watched our neighbouring property which is rented out by a lady in a retirement home and the tenant trashed the house.  The real estate took them to court and they were reimbursed 6 months rent.  Where is the fairness is that and you aim to give more rights to tennanat.  Guess what? I saw what Victoria brought in and both units up for sale. One sold causing old person to be homeless as private buyer brought house.  Second unit for sale and will go to private buyer. You now have to house two pensioners as I am not prepared to be ripped off by bad tenants.."
Noise issue in units with loud music and parties
"It's FAR too expensive, and you know this. I'm a 40yr old bloke with no kids and no wife.... It's FLAT OUT TOO EXPENSIVE to rent a house on my own and given that I actually have hobbies and need a fair amount of storage... it's IMPOSSIBLE to live."
Tenant should pay for repairs which go beyond the bond money 
"Fairness for renters moving out and bond returns, more thorough inspection reports however 6 monthly inspections not 3 monthly, allowing pets, allowing picture hooks, fairness for water use if gardens are reticulated and during summer returns and water restrictions an understanding that grass will not be green all the time"
Flexibility for good tenants with good rental history. To be able to hand a picture of my family on a wall without the fear of loosing my bond.
Fairer Rules for Tenants
When renting a property I would like it to be mandatory that the locks are changed on all entry points including garage spaces to ensure previous tenants can not have access to any entry points including garage and storage spaces. There is no guarantee that previous tenants can’t just let themselves in after their lease has expired.
"Pad locks on front & back doors for security and insurance reasons, there are houses that most probably do not meet the standards for renting, which should be rectified for safety reasons  "
"BEING ABLE TO ADVERTISE FOR A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TENANT TO FIT IN WITH THE EXISTING LONG TERM TENANTS WHO RESIDE AT THE PROPERTY ALREADY E.G. SINGLE, FEMALE, MALE, NO PETS, NON SMOKING.  THIS ENSURES I DON'T LOSE MY EXISTING LONG TERM TENANTS (OVER 20 YEARS)"
Better communication with tenants
I am a property owner and would like to have confidence in the length of time that reports are held against tenants in Ticka.  
More laws introduced to protect landlords' hard-earned assets.
Simplify and improve the RTA
Less house inspections 
"Enabling pensioners and low income couples or families to be accepted for rentals based on credit scores or positive rental history when applying for rentals. How are we supposed to stack up to middle or high income households when we need homes too and most likely have less choices with our budget? Also, a cap on rental hikes. "
Remove the one sided rules
Tenants need to be held accountable for damage and non payment of rent.
"It includes Water usage in my charges as a landlord, in other states the renter pays the water usage rates."
"Make it harder for owners to use the ""family"" loophole to avoid renewing a lease. I've had an agent tell us the owner's nephew needed the place when our lease was expiring, so they could kick us out to put up the rent from $300 per week to $400, because we had refurbished the place  and made it more valuable (with the agent's advance permission, and no indication from them that our work would disadvantage us in the long run). A few days after we left, we saw the place advertised, so we know the agent gave us a false reason to refuse renewing the lease.  Introduce a penalty on owners who do this!!"
The landlord not being able to sell the property during the lease period. Minimum lease being a 2 year period!
attitude by landlord and by rental agents - very strong indication is that by both is that a renter is considered as a second class citizen and all care is not considered within the rental tenancy act - not saying RTA do not do a good job of advising but the stigma of our rental experience since 2008 by the nominated parties above within this statement is extra ordinary - we have moved two times in the period of 2008 to 2018 in area 4053 and just moved to 4500.
"Ensure that certain authorities enforce legislation requirements to tenants, especially during the dispute and QCAT process. "
"I'd like to charge the tenant for the full amount of the water bill, not just the water consumption."
Give Landlords more rights in respect to their properties.  Balance out the bias away from tenants.
Clearer conditions for tenancies - what tenants can and can't do and what are negotiable conditions
Be able to recoup cost of damage and unpaid rental more easily.
"Make tenants more responsible for the every day wear and tear on the property. eg. handles coming off doors, leaking taps, sliding doors not working properly because of dirt not cleaned out of tracks which damage rollers. Why should owners have to pay for wheelie bin pick up."
"when renters leave with no notice, rent unpaid, house damaged and not cleaned, a way to make them responsible"
real estate agents ability to help
"It's very hard to get pets approved. Let alone bigger dogs. I have a 40kg greyhound and I've had a lot of struggle to find a place that's within budget, and will accept pets, and will accept such a big dog.

Getting repairs fixed is also an issue sometimes. I understand the owner of the place has to be notified and give approval - but when my front door (the only way in and out of the property) won't lock, and the agent takes 2 weeks to fix the problem because the owner went on holidays. That's not acceptable. Something needs to be done to clear up the ""emergency repairs"" list."
Real estate agents knowing their responsibilities and not trying to lie to tenants and owners. Just do their jobs properly and not lie about stuff to try and cheat the tenant out of their money.
"not having to deal with dodgy real estate agents who are incredibly judgemental on fickle things such as your appearance. I'm sure there is a blacklist of bad tenants, however there should be a website/registry where Tenants can blacklist bad Real Estate agents who genuinely should NOT be in business because they treat people worse than the dirt under their Gucci shoes."
Balance between the rights of owners and tenants.  It seems to favour tenants at this point in time.
Better house maintenance 
Complete reform of the regulatory framework governing renting residential property
Tenants should be permitted the option of a periodic lease after an initial fixed term lease to prevent them from being forced to commit to leaving a property before finding the next property and risking a period of homelessness.
Automatic rent increase annualky
Not having an inspection every three months
The amount of invasive house inspections every few months.
"Fairer bond claiming. Claims on bond should specify amounts, include quotes, and require receipts after action. Limits should be placed on claimable items."
Unlawful payment methods - (being charged to pay rent)
"Reduction in rent, less opposition to having pets"
The bond is not sufficient for current notice periods. If we lodge a form 11 then form 12 then have keys returned the bond is almost gone just in rent arrears. If it goes to court it is even longer.
Having checks on property managers to ensure they are doing their role correctly.
"Make the agents complete the following instead of getting people in and then have to fix, clean etc when paying rent.
Clean properly
Ensure connection to WiFi is possible
Don't promise what you don't know (ie)yes you can put a keylock box there (and then find out after signing lease that NO you cant)
Complete a full maintenance check-
Dryer working
Wash macjhine working
Air conditioners working and LAST service date
New smoke alarm batteries
"
Tenants if blacklisted by the managing real estate agent will have significant problems being approved for future rentals. This process is not very transparent. I would like to see it much easier for tenants and landlords to all have access to this Tenancy Database and be able to lodge appeals for unjustified names being added to the Tenancy Database. Tenants live in fear of being unfairly added to the blacklist if the real estate agent has a grudge which allows them to be unreasonable at times.
"Having complaints taken seriosly,especially regarding violent co_tenants and their visitors."
make it easier to remove non-paying tenants
Give landlords more rights 
"The tenants have more rights than the property owner that is paying all maintenance bills. Often calling for trades people at high call out cost for minor maintenance that is well within there capability, such as changing a standard light globe. Property owners change there own globes, and would not pay an electrician or handyman to change such items"
"You feel
Like you are at the mercy of poor real estates who won’t listen to good tenants sometimes "
More rights for home owners
"when a dispute occurs, have mandatory arbitration before having to go to court. Currently such a process is only 'optional' to attend, and outcomes are not binding.
The cost of contesting disputes needs to be reduced"
Better controls on real estate agents to stop bullying
"As a landlord, finding people that are responsible and respect the property as they would their own. "
Better communication between all parties involved
"clarification about what property inspections should cover. It's ridiculous that property inspections raise concerns about whether or not beds are made, or whether clean dishes drying on the sink should be put in a cupboard or not."
Allow pets inside.  Our place has no area for a pet outside.  They know we have a pet but still have to apply to allow our member inside.
"Make it easier to have pets in rentals. I have pets predominantly to maintain my mental wellbeing, and the stress of moving and finding properties that allow pets increase that existing stress."
"It is too difficult to get bad tenants out of a property. This is bad for everyone, but neighbours suffer and it often falls back on them to report to agents so that a number of breaches can be served. "
legislation to be more fair - becoming increasingly harder to manage rental properties as a property manager with legislation and QCAT rulings so heavily in favour of tenants
"I would train Property Managers to be hospitable and personable. My experience is that they are office juniors in a larger real estate business and are generally undertrained, immature, pompous and rude. As a tenant by choice I am generally treated as a low priority administrative annoyance at best or a potential trouble maker or enemy from the inspection onward. In all of my other business transactions I am treated with the respect that a customer deserves. This industry is appallingly rude. When I spend $20,000 a year or more with ANYONE I expect MUCH more. I have never had such problems when dealing directly with property owners."
Ensure that tenants accept responsibility for the damage they do and complete the repairs at their expense instead of mine
Real-estate agents shouldn't have to wait to fix things in houses that don't meet codes. ie we waited 2months for gas bottles at our Paddington property to become complaint and the owner said he has always had it that way so it will be fine.  
"That there is more control about how the landlord can claim from the bond to pay for repairs or replacements. I have had the unfortunate experience that when I cannot prove that damage existed before moving in (i.e. I forgot to take photos or overlooked or didn't notice certain things and mark them on the entry condition report), the landlord has claimed that I am responsible, when in fact I wasn't. That inspections focus on how the property is being looked after/maintained rather than how clean or tidy it is. I have had comments such as shower doors are not clean enough, which is quite invasive/insulting. There should be a checklist of items to report on at the inspections. Just as tenants fill out an application to rent and the landlord, owner, agent assesses the tenant beforehand, the landlords/owners of properties should also complete a form that tenants have access to, i.e. containing information about them which would be helpful for tenants to make a decision on which property to rent (some owners/landlords are really picky/difficult, or have a bad track record or reputation with tenants, or are dishonest and try to claim anything they can at the end of a lease and new tenants don't know this before renting, thus are put at risk of an unpleasant rental period)."
Fairness in the mediation/tribunal process
Confusion between rent charges and water charges. Both appear on my rent ledger and so the water cost has made our rent payments go in arrears and we get breached. Water bills offer turn up a couple of bills at a time.
"Do not rent - property manager.
Would try to change the balance back to allow the Owner to have some rights - because at moment very difficult to attract new Owners/Investors as Government policy makes property a very poor performing investment.
The new rules will drive Owners away, and we have been advising Owners of the unintended consequences of these changes since the Coroners inquest bought down their findings years ago."
greater rights for the renters
More tegular rent reviews
I would like to stop the ability of certain people to be able to access keys from real estate to access the property to do certain services. I don't like that people can be in my home without me being home.
Better training and education with property agencies and a clear outline of what home owners expect from them in relation to the management of their property
Reduce the frequency of rental inspections. Every 3 months is too much. How about every 3 months in the first year and then yearly thereafter. The taking of photography should be forbidden. It's an invasion of privacy.
Kick out bad tenants easier
There is no accountability for issues within your property - tenants can break something and just claim it happened and it wasn't their fault and you become liable for it
To be treated like a human being not just a cash cow paying someone’s mortgage. 
"I do believe that there needs to be some clarification around the Act under 291 Notice to leave without ground, as the RTA have stated that it is a grey area and that they cannot interpret the Law. The Act states as below;


291 Notice to leave without ground
(1) The lessor may give a notice to leave the premises to the tenant without stating a ground for the notice.

(2) However, the lessor must not give a notice to leave under this section because—

(a) the tenant has applied, or is proposing to apply, to a tribunal for an order under this Act; or

(b) the tenant—

(i) has complained to a government entity about an act or omission of the lessor adversely affecting the tenant; or

(ii) has taken some other action to enforce the tenant’s rights; or

(c) an order of a tribunal is in force in relation to the lessor and tenant.

 

Under the Act S291 (b) (ii) - has taken some other action to enforce the tenant’s rights;

I believe that this part of the Act covers the tenants’ rights that they are entitled to 14 days prior to expiry of lease to provide their answer. I am all in favour of protecting the Landlord rights as well, (as I have previously been a landlord) but surely the tenant’s rights should also be protected.I have been given a Notice to Leave when the landlord asked my to re-sign a lease 60 days before it was due. I was told by the real estate agent that if you don't  know 60 days prior then a are out."
end compulsory property manager inspections 
"Increase the bond amount to 5 weeks rent.
Allow a pet bond to a minimum of 5 weeks rent."
"Not as many house inspections. Would be good to have a 'good behaviour' scheme were if you have proven to look after the property, clean and well kept - you can be rewarded with 6 monthly inspections."
"Personal exit check with tenants when vacating the property - in our block of units many tenants just leave large items on the footpath, in the yard, in the bin area and once they have vacated, it is impossible to say who, as owner of the rubbish, should have made arrangements to have it removed from the property."
More powers for managing agents and owners
Getting annual rent increase 
"As a property manager and business owner we need to ensure that the owner has more rights, more and more I find that the tenant leaves the property either damaged or unclean, also in this area we have a lot of trouble with overcrowding in properties due to back packers renting houses and filling them with too many people. I think that the Principal Licensee should have more authority to enter these properties if he/she feels that the Tenant is putting the house/tenants or owner at risk. There also needs to be something done regarding mediation and QCAT if a tenant disputes cleaning or damage they really get away with it."
Direct debit for rent so not to get behind in rent payments 
"Landlords have absolutely no rights and it is geared all towards the tenant. We have our primary home we had to rent  when we moved away and different tenants we had were disgraceful and cost us thousands, yet they got away with it as we had no legal rights at all and you want to give tenants more rights..are you kidding. To improve you need to protect the  owner and nothing  and noone does"
Very happy as is since my agent has been doing very good job
More flexibility around leases. 
More accountability of tenants for their actions
STOP QLD GOVERNMENT FROM CHANGING ANYTHING
The notice period a tenant has to give is two weeks.  This is unfair to property owners who (in this challenging market) have to find replacements when on a periodical lease.
Certainty around extension or new term 
Longer term leases
Compulsory car parking allowances for each unit!
"Honest communication between tenants, agents and owners regarding property maintenance, repairs and/or improvements. There is often a blame game on part of both owner and agent re: knowledge of issues and approval granted for work required. "
Maintenance must be attended to immediately.
Equal fairness to both tenants and landlords as clearly some policies or criteria favour the tenant. 
Tenants to respect the property & property owner more.
More direct action if tenancy is in breach. Similar to emergency housing options
This question is directed towards a tenant not a property manager
Being able to go to a periodic Contract after a certain timeframe i.e. 1 year
"The regulations are so much in favour of Tenants and generally for all the wrong reasons, that it is tantamount to reverse discrimination. After all it is my property for which I have borrowed a lot of money to construct and employ a managing agent for barely sufficient returns. If Negative Gearing is not available after the next Federal Elections I will sell off my rental units and Never Vote for Labour Again!!"
Including photos in entry condition report print outs
Rent is equal value to property condition.
Not have qld govt tenants ever again!
"educating tenants to take a greater care of the properties, thus reducing cost on the industrey.  "
Better screening process 
Take matters to QCAT rather than negotiating with a biased property manager and their influencing landlord.
"Whilst we all appreciate a good tenant which most are, we are often faced with having to repair and go without rent beyond bond from those that have turned out to be considerably less than good."
"Owners/Real estates realizing that the renter is poor, living week to week on very little and cannot afford repairs or full house painting, carpet/lino replacing. Getting cleaners/carpet/mower people in after moving usually takes all the bond, if the tenant pays private then the Real Estate should return 100%. If not and these things are taken out of the bond, proof should be sent to show that those costs are true and took 100% of bond. If the renter has dogs, or are not gardeners is it expected that they replace lawns, shrubs to pre-rent conditions, I say yes however some Real Estates take older photo's and not look at the exact conditions when a new renter moves in. I have a file of the new photo's and the Real Estates (supposedly taken same day) and clearly there is damaged items, marks, holes that are different. "
Having my dog at any property not having to search only pet friendly properties 
Make it easier to remove problem tenants.
As a landlord it has been good so far with great property managers.
"Less subjectivity about maintenance. It 100% depends if the owner an afford it. There should be a schedule of maintenance items over the years that the owner agrees to, so regular maintenance like gutter repairs are actually addressed."
Longer term tenants
More bond needs to be taken from tenants to cover damage and getting behind in their rent
"Easier recourse to address dangerous, unsafe or coercive landlords."
More availablility of pet-friendly properties - this needs to be substantially increased 
Maintenance repairs done In a timely manner 
More funding to help with price of rent 
rental manger to open more than one day a week
Harder penalties for landlords who won't abide by tenancy laws and repeatedly breach the tenancy laws
"Stronger rights for tenants regarding landlords selling houses when a tenant is on a lease or better compensation for a tenant when a landlord intends to sell. IE: flexibility to move anytime from when the house is put on sale, rental relief or cash compensation when allowing buyers to view the property, a mandatory written guide for when a landlord wants a tenant to break lease "
To ensure that my properties are protected and remain in good condition. These were new properties when I started renting them out around 7 years ago and as this is my retirement investment I want to make sure that I have control over what can and can't be done to my properties.
"Ive found that the tenancy managers are not very trained, and are not very good at their jobs. This is the case from both a renter and a landlord. "
"less red tape on mandatory compliance requirements of Govt like safety audits, asbestos inspections etc that have be done and redone every few years at great expense"
Allow pets at all rentals
It is currently too hard to remove destructive or non compliant tenants.  
Ability to get unruly tenants out of home before end of lease 
Having the possibility to transfer bond over to the next house I would be renting
Equal playing field for landlords. Landlords are not protected against tenant damages particularly when Property Managers are not bothering to register complaints with TICA.  Failure of this exposes Landlords to bad repeat offenders. This should be made mandatory.
That real estates are regulated for the standard of support they provide not just to landlords but to tenants as well. That landlords and agents treat tenants with respect. That landlords and agents are required to explain tenant rights not just give a book and drop in to a house whenever they feel like it. 
"Tenants should be responsible for paying all rates, water, utilities as is done in the UK"
Make tenants accountable for their water consumption.
"Accountability checks on real estates. I have encountered real estates that did not lodge any change of bond forms (form 6) with the RTA, not contacting the landlord regarding major maintenance (leaking sewage), lodging my rent payments on another properties ledger and issuing me with a notice of being in arrears. "
Good property manager 
More accepting of pets and larger families
More frequent rental reviews
since I have had a rental property in qld I have had my first 2 lots of tenants trat my property like a tip and leave owing rental money
Owner of the property should have more rights
On line RTA form lodgement for private landlords 
Less invasion from landlords
Better relationships with Real Estate contacts
Greater oversight of property managers
"Priced accordingly,
Not putting the price up for no reason & fixing issues when brought to landlord attention "
"Tenants mandatory full bond clean including washing all walls, windows inside and out, screens.  Clean outside of the house, and mow lawns and weed gardens on vacating. Receipt provided.  "
Third party inspections at beginning and end of lease.
Better security around rental future
Rent prices to be reduced. It is a struggle to pay rent. We spend 50% of income on rent each week. 
"Real Estate Agents that tell renters the truth about the property, especially when owner is selling the property."
have some tenants that treat the property with respect
All property managers should disclose all info to tenants. Eg if owner only wants to rent house for 6 months.
Have a system that rates renters as some know exactly how to rip off landlords and leave damaged houses without paying their last month’s rent effectively getting their bond back. Then their forwarding contacts are bogus so they are uncontactable unless the landlord goes through a protracted process to gain restitution.
When owners sell the property all the inspections and open houses are a real invasion of privacy that can go on for YEARS
"I would prefer fewer routine inspections, especially as a long-term tenant who has never caused any damage to the property I am renting. Having a stranger enter to poke around every 3 months is invasive."
The house would have been properly cleaned before we moved in
Reduce the amount of inspections once established that you are a good tenant.
That an eviction notice can be served if you are 2 weeks behind in rent. It should be at least a month before eviction
Fairness between a landlord and a tenant. 
"Better communication with real estate , getting back to people in a reasonable time frame"
Making qcat answerable for its appalling timeframes and outcomes 
That the rental rates become more affordable for families. 
"When tenants fail to meet their responsibilities and stop paying rent then fall into arrears, landlords and their agents should have speedier timeframes to take remedial action.  We've had an experience of having to take a tenant to court and ultimately got an eviction order.  That whole process took months to work through the system until they were finally out and we were left to pack up their goods, clean up the property, fix the damage they left behind all on top of the loss of rental income that was no where near covered by the bond.  That whole nasty experience proved to us that current laws favour the tenants well and truly over landlords. "
"Compensation. I lived in an apartment, block of 14; the garage flooded, to 2 feet. The agents (Ray Edward R/E, Hervey Bay were aware prior to moving in & did not divulge. The following year had the garage flood three times & agents continue to rent & sell apartments. 
Additionally, we went without a TV for 6 months as the agents  had an issue with a main switch, controlling all apartments televisions; it was within another VACANT apartment. There was no recourse available to me, simply loss of personal items in flood, plus cleaning x 3 and months of inconvenience not having tv; not fit for purpose intended. "
Lchange the rental bond form so bond can be transferred from one property to another independant of the Agent and owner.

Written response to Maintenance Request forms.
Lack of laws supporting owners
"I owned a home for 20yrs before I started renting and I am upset at the power property manages think they have when it comes to tenants.
They treat you like you are second rate citizen because you are renting 
I would make it more fair for renters and educate property managers in how to treat renters, they do not know our background and why we are renting
you can be the best tenant in the world however if there's one little issue the property managers treat you like a bad tenant
I'm over it "
Fairer increases in rent -no more than $10 per year. And more benefits to long term and great tenants who treat home and land respectfully and make improvements to gardens etc. Communication between landlords and tenants. Pest control by landlords agents annually. 
I would like more places to accept pets
Allow for bonds to be transferrable within the RTA when moving house. At the moment it can only be done if the property is with the same agent. Iv the bond is held centrally by the RTA why should it matter what agent is managing the rental?
Less inspections and landlords compelled to disclose knowledge of developments in the area that may impact tenant 
Repairs and maintenance are necessary but certainly reduce my ability to earn a pension income in retirement
Property managers doing what they say they would.
Less frequent inspections 
Less weekly rental fees 
"*Increased bond money to cover damage caused by tenants,their animals and visitors.
*Real Estate agents should conduct satisfactory inspections and give tenants written notification to remedy breaches of the lease and follow up to ensure that the breaches have been rectified.
*Many Real Estate agents are not interested in helping either the tenant or owner of the property. They are interested only in collecting the commission."
"service at RTA, staff needs training, not just reading from a computer screen."
"I rented for many years and now I own properties I rent out.  I was always a good tenant and left the place better than when I moved in however I have had some shocking people rent from me who just don't care and when they leave...take everything not nailed down ie. light bulbs, inserts for cutlery draw"
Better access to being about to report maintenance and issues with rental
"Property to be left In original condition.
Tenants 
not to damage property"
Spurious claims by both lessors and lessees
Better communication between realestate and myself
One bad experience with one Property Manager should not impact on all of my future rental applications.  
"A strong ""Duty of Care"" legislated for Real Estate agencies and property owners. COntinued inaction by one and naivety on the other were the major forces which lead to a death in our family."
Greater protection for renters. Cap in rental increases. Reduction in rental inspection frequency. Greater length of time required before entry into rental property by agent/owner.
"Pet owning is Extremely difficult as a tenant, I would like to see pet friendly reforms"
Less government interference
A Stan disused form for asking referees questions 
Better access to Tenants Queensland services - they are underfunded and can't always answer the phone
Have different managers for my complex that stay on-site and open the office longer than 2 hours a day Monday to Friday only.
Changing reform surrounding the ownership of pets. Also the price- they are too high.
"I don't know what to change but too many real estates slip under the radar for being dodgy (my house was advertised to $220/wk so I applied for it and got it. then my partner and I signed the lease and afterwards she decided to tell us that the rent was being raised to $260/wk and it was too late, we are trapped now."

A longer term would be better for tenants and owners.
A better understanding of tenants applying and more accurate records of past rental history
Properties need to be better maintained 
Making it less difficult to get rid of malicious tenants who fall behind in rent and damage property. Currently it is too cumbersome to pursue them and many know how to play the game.
"If Owners renovated more regularly.

"
Ease up on price of rent for pensioners 
Paying less rent
"I have been a landlord for 20 yrs.  I have experienced property damage, tenants having pets when no pets allowed causing extensive damage, gardens overgrown, late rent and genuinely lack of care and attitude. I meticulously maintain my properties. The tenants never wait for repairs etc.
So from my experiences over 20 yrs my changes are directed to the tenant.
1. Tighten rules around tenants caring for rental properties.
2. Have a rental probation period.
2. Increase the bond to cover damage.
3. The tenant has to insure against property damage also not just their contents."
The Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008 needs to be more specific. Some items such as window damages aren't referred too within the legislation. 
The last 3 houses I've lived in have been sold and they gave me 7 weeks to find a house and move out. I had to borrow money each time to move.  One of them I believe we were kicked out because the refused to fix the broken garage door that i kept asking them to fix. 
Ensure there are pet bonds of 1.5 times the monthly rent and 2 times the monthly rent bond to cover loss of rent and damage from tenants
Tenancy laws are very pro-tenants.  Notice periods should be the same for both tenants and landlords for instance.
I would like my tenants to stop damaging my property and for the property manager to get them to properly clean and repair my property before they leave it.
Better screen the tenants.
"Being able to have a tenant who does'nt pay rent on time removed from the property quickly,
Being able to rent the property to people without pets.
Being able to stop tenants putting nail holes in walls."
The time that owners take to undertake and complete maintenance and repairs 
Making Property Managers accountable and responsible for their actions - or lack thereof.
The price of rentals. Way to expensive for most families 
Water accounts have to be set up by tenants just like electricity.
I would allow leases to be broken by tenants with 4 weeks notice to be in line with other states. The thought of paying 6 months rent for a place you’re not living in while tge property managers take their time finding another tenant is ridiculous.
Capped rental increases linked which require justification by the landlord
Tenants need to be more mindful of the garden. They leave it in an uninhabital state with little care. At the end of every tenancy I have to spend a couple of weekends and lots of money late to get it back into a state to rent. They are always covered by the fair wear and tear clause and do not have to pay for this upkeep. It's draining in time and resources.
Communication with tenants particularly if there rent payment is late
Make tenants appreciate the property they live knowing it doesn’t belong to them and that if they want to do what ever they want in a property they should purchase their own 
"Stop property mananger's taking photographs of my home when inspecting.  If there was damage to the property or maintenance needed, then fire away but photographing my space - that I pay more than the cost of a mortgage to live in - for no other reason that to add it to my tenant file feels lie not only an invasion of privacy but as though an arsenal is being built against me.  With pictures of my untidy laundry room as ammo.
Also, the general attitude of property mananger's towards tenants is terrible.  I feel as though we are looked down upon just because we are renters.  I understand that property managers deal with difficult tenants from time to time but for those of us who pay our rent on time and take care of the properties we live in, it would be nice to have some courtesy thrown our way."
Better tenants and better protection for owners
Have the right to have tenants evicted from a property where the police are repeatedly call because of disturbances to the neighborhood.
"After 9 years of renting our place and having had no problems with inspections, it would be nice to have them 6 monthly instead of 3 monthly"
Some of the furniture—eg bed & sofa
"Cheaper rent,  have more flexibility in leases,  rent prices and modifications. 
Longer leasers like a business.  Where you partially own the property and can modify it. "
Pet friendly rentals. I'd happily sign to cover reasonable  pet damage financially above bond. (Ie chewing damage)
Ability to have a say in who rents my property.
Standardised rental checks
Hold real estate agents accountable to property owners for poor management
"When maintenance is reported, it should have a time limit to being fixed."
Force landlords to give you at least a 6 month lease when you have been in the same place for over 12 months.
hi I would change the amount of rent inspection or the time frame they are held.i think that in the first 2yrs it should be twice a year and after that maybe once a year or every two years. also the right to reduce the rent not increase it every contract as they know its difficult to find another property and the cost involved to move is quite high.
"Longer, more secure leases"
More accountability for rental agents in dealing in a timely manner with communication between tenants and owners.
"Create stability for loyal and responsible tenants e.g. long term agreements that protect the tenant from having to move every couple of years for example when the property changes ownership or the owner decides to renovate. 
My lease was not renewed on 4 separate occasions for the above reasons.  Constantly relocating is not only stressful but also costly (demoralised and potential furniture).  The tenants property (I.e. furniture/appliances) is at risk of being damaged."
Real estate agents to have more thorough knowledge of tenancy laws.
"One property I lived in recently had a number of very obvious repairs needed, which were noted as part of the entry condition report.  These should have been actioned by the Property Manager well before they had deteriorated to the point they had.
Property Managers and Landlords should have more responsibility/expectation to maintain their properties (not just emergency items), rather than the tenant needing to make (repeated) requests for repairs, which often feels like it will put your rental agreement at risk.  
I am both a tenant and a landlord, and would not expect anyone to live in a quality of home I would not live in myself."
Rental prices should be equal to the quality of the property being rented. 
Having more pet friendly properties available 
I am a property manager and I feel some of the legislation needs to be adjusted to allow the landlords to continue having a rental property.
"There is no respect for the rules and as a tenant trying to rent in an increasingly tight market, property managers and landlords aren't playing by the rules. We need stricter enforcement of the law with easier access to help with enforcement and rogue landlords and agents need to be dealt with. "
"There needs to be more affordable properties available for young renters, as students we find it difficult to pay amounts that we can’t simply afford and I think this is a vital issue and new policies regarding this issue needs to be implemented and improved. "
"Ability to own pets and rent
Safety of houses/maintenance requirements
No. Of times a landlore/rental agents can enter the property in a year
Inspection cleaning requirements (should not be the equivalent of a rental bond clean)"
"Treat those cheap venetian blinds as consumables or don't allow them in a house.  Theyre fixed tp the window so as a tenant you can't avoid using them,  however they very easily bend or pick up dirt that is difficult to return to exact standard of ehen you moved in. "
"Continue with the balance between tenant and landlord. Tenants making modifications to a property they do not own, causes a financial impact on a landlord. Not all landlords are in financial positions to rectify these. They use their investment as a retirement so they are not reliant on Government financial assistance later on."
"Reduced times on repairs. 
Consistency across agencies in regards to inspection conditions eg. last rental agency didn't inspect for 5 months then when they finally did, they basically wanted the house to look unlived in"
"Pricing, repairs take too long to be completed, no sense of urgency on owners behalf."
reduce red tape
"Continued open communication with Real Estate Agents, tenants and landlords.  Keeping on top of any problems or concerns before they become a major issue"
Fewer property inspections and longer notice for them by law.
More immediate action by owners to fix major issues such as rotten fencing etc
More grounds in the Act for landlord's to evict problem tenants.
change present laws so that tenants are accountable for loss of rent & damages caused which is not compensated for with bond monies.
"All things need to be fair. At the moment a lot of items are one sided. 
Pet Laws - a bond should be accepted to cover any damages to either garden, fixed property etc. Pest control and extra cleaning should then be done on a tenant with pets vacating the premises.
Termination Notices - Owner has to give 2 mnths notice, tenants 2 weeks - this does not seem fair - make it one month for both parties prior to expiry of a fixed term contract."
Make it mandatory that owners must conduct an annual pest control.
"Since we have been renting the same place for approx. 13 years, less inspections
Ability to have pets.
Having the place insulated or air conditioned for Queensland summers"
more prompt response to maintenance issues
"Caps on rent increases, greater flexibility for lease duration, caps on rent payments for renters who break a lease (ie. don't just have to pay indefinitely until the property is filled or lease expires)."
Ensure that the tenants understand their obligations and responsibilities as per the tenancy agreement.
Making the owners fix bricks falling off the back yard walls and rotting gates
Exempt pensioners from having to pay water bills while renting
"The ability for the Real Estate I'm dealing with to understand ""communication"""
Pets should be welcomed even if you have to have a seperate bond for them but this should not be necessarry if the pet comes with good references .   also 3 month house inspection I believe this should be done after the first month if there is no problems and the renter comes with good references this should only be done there after once a year.  it use to feel like your own home coming in every 3 months taking photos is an intusion 
That the owners didn't sale specially when your getting older and are unable to find anything that comes close to what you havep
Consistency through real estates and their property managers.
More options to help with resolving ongoing issues
"Educate tenants on their rights, rather than let agents be bullies. Enforce agent good behavior."
"A fairer system that recognises and prioritises the rights of people to have a home, not just somewhere to live."
"Relaxation on break leases, due to excessive noise or unliveability. Less repercussions on tenants when these situations occur as it can take a serious mental and physical health toll especially to night shift workers"
Less fees for real estate agents
Better vetting of potential tenants rental history
"I have been renting in sharehouses since 2013. This has been great. Renting is quite a carefree existence (apart from paying the rent, which increases when more regulation is imposed on landlords), but no doubt you will be inundated with complaints from renters, because this is Australia, and closet communists will want more from the landlords who own the capital until we all live in tents, but at least its equal (or ""equitable"" per the current buzzword).

You will get 2 suggestions for the price of 1:

(1) The one thing that banes me is the difficulty of sub-leasing. For example, I go to Argentina for a 1 month holiday, on a whim, and want someone to pay my rent for 5 weeks while I'm away. The room is furnished with my belongings, and they pay rent to me, so I have a vested interest in someone of good character and means to take my place for a short period. If I get off the lease, and that temporary sub-tenant gets on the lease (as my tenancy agreements over the last few years stipulate - we can be evicted if they find out we are sub-leasing) then I have no right to move back in when I return. Therefore, if I follow my rental agreement, and I want my room back upon return, I am forced to pay rent for a vacant room for a month. My suggestion would be to allow short-term sub-leases to not require a change in the lease agreement. For example, a less than 6 week sub-lease should not require a change in the lease agreement, and each tenant should be allowed maximum 2-3 sub-leases per year, to prevent an Airbnb operation against the owner's will. We would have to notify our landlord, but they should have limited reasons to prevent the short-term sub-lease.

(2) I would like to see long-term residential leases become the norm, as I believe they are in Europe amongst other places. A family is ensured a residency for 5 years while the children are in school, for example; when the lease is for at least 5 years the tenants should also have the right to alter the property to some extent, such as by planting hedges, and have to chip in for a new toilet if it is installed during the tenancy but then malfunctions (i.e. we the landlords gave you a new toilet, you've used it until it broke again, now we should go 50/50 on another toilet). For a lease over 5 years, the tenants should from the outset contribute to the costs of insurance too.

Surprise 3rd suggestion:

(3) 6 people is not a boarding house. The strict regulation that applies to boarding houses is too far-reaching. A boarding house should be 8 people, minimum, and I'm compromising here. We live in a large home that is under-utilised because of these regulations. The place fits 7 bedrooms, yet only 5 people are on the lease. Only a wowser would think a 6 person property is boarding house. No offence. That's 3 couples. Do we really need lit up ""fire escape"" signs down the hallway now? Come on."
"Give the RTA more power to support tenants or landlords when disputes arise, instead of only acting as a mediating body which offers advice & guidance with the legislation. The process to escalate issues to the tribunal is too time consuming & difficult. "
Being able to remove tenants quicker when rent is not paid or substantial property damage has been made.
"owners have no rights in the courts and tenants are not held accountable to pay for damage, unpaid rent, etc"
"Allow pets, some kind of rent to buy programs to reward long term renters."
more affordable rents for disadvantaged people
Stop agents/landlords from invading my privacy every 3 months.
"When exiting a property before the lease is up, you should only have to pay, at most, 1 extra month rent and the advertising costs. Having to continue paying rent until the original lease ends is ridiculous."
Give owners more power over their own properties
"I find frequent inspections humiliating, and the fact that you cannot even change when people enter hour home is against some basic human rights. "
"The ability to make and co-invest in minor improvements to the property (ie, replacing lightbulbs with LED lighting, installing air-conditioning), or to paint or repair parts of the building."
Nothing. The system works fairly as it is.
"Nothing, why change anything?  I am very happy as an owner and my tennants have been there for 5 years"
Right to remove a tenant when he/she is not paying rent in a timely manner
Give more rights to tenants to make changes to longterm rentals and more options for early exit of leases.
Remove the rta bias that is currently too much in favour of renters over landlords. 
 Corrupt & greedy landlords getting some justice
I find as a tenant that being on top of my rent and highlighting any change in property immediately to the realestate agent an easier ride with the realestate agent. I have had experiences that you are often classed as a second rate citizen. It would be good to be able to put a picture frame up. I have also rented through a private owner and that was the worst experience with the owner turning up out of the blue and taking people through without notice when we decided to leave. As an owner that has a rental property I find having a realestate agent manage the property handy but when the property manager changes often minor changes and defects get lost and I have had big bills to fix things as they have built up and not paid attention earlier on.
"Allowing more freedom for the Tenant examples being allowing pets unless tenant has bad record with pets in rentals, allowing tenants to put up curtains and wall hangers if they agree to fix the holes when they leave or keep curtains/wall hangers in for owner of property to keep."
"I would not allow owners to discriminate on family size, whether there are children and cultural background.  The owners should not be required to know if there are children as this gives them the ability to discriminate.  The applications should not contain names that would allow them to discriminate for cultural reasons.  Owners should not be allowed to deny applicants and provide no reason as this allows them to discriminate. "
"Improve the balance in the relationship between landlord & tenant.
One party to the agreement shouldn't have more rights than the other, bad landlords should be made accountable and so should bad tenants.
Good relationships between landlord, agent & tenant are forged through fair treatment for all."
Tenants are clearly the weaker party in this contract and therefore there should be far more clearly defined rules laws around how agents landlords can behave.
Rental property owners should have more rights over the places they own.
I live in the NT but own property in QLD.
More pet friendly rentals.
mandatory air conditioning in all residences. 
Real estate agents that treat you like 2nd class citizens.
"Cleaning standards when moving to a new property. 
Higher level of understanding the laws as property managers
"
Tougher judgments in QCAT for tenants who do the wrong thing and cost landlords $1000's of dollars. We need to remove the assumption that these costs are somehow covered under tax or insurance. Many landlords have had to take massive losses due to needing to sell their homes in a as is condition due to not being able to remedy tenant damages. Would like to see the RTA hold larger bonds so that landlords can get their property ready for another tenancy and then RTA pursues the tenants for the difference after bond. 
Making it easier to evict tenants at the end of a tenancy agreement and not have the law on their side with they squat in a house that isn't theirs
"remove red tape relating to the removal of tenants who do the wrong thing eg damage to property or non payment of rent. The property owner is not the local welfare office and should not have to endure tenants who do not pay rent for any longer than four weeks. Eviction should then be automatic. Property owners should have the right of refusal if there are doubts about the prospective tenants on any grounds.

Property owners have a responsibility to ensure the safety etc of the property. Real estate agents appear to take a low key approach to property inspections concentrating on cleanliness and appearance rather than some issues which may impact on safety.
Q1.3 below is an incomplete one which does not cover a variety of situations. None of the statements are acceptable. A tenant may be reluctant to report issues because the rent may go up. The property owner is up the creek if eviction is being considered. Obviously the person who framed the question is also in the ""don't know "" category as well."
"Get rid of body corp companies.Only have residents and owners and to an extent tenants on body corps to every seperate title.Body corp companies are parasites and have no business sticking their noses in my business and are only miserable self satisfied do gooders who try to justify themselves by being pests.They should stay away from normal people,and get real jobs please get these bottom feeders out of the system."
"A country wide rating online system that uses the tax file number to validate or a passport number if your from over seas, A number that I can take with me that indicates I am a good client, this would stop the need for agents to ring around chasing rental history"
Tenants to pay water bills
If a tenant does not pay on time it should be easier for the landlord to give a notice to leave. The landlord needs to pay bills such as rates and water for the property and cannot forfeit their payment!!!! 
"I shouldn’t have to prepare the house at the end of my rental to meet  the owner’s marketing needs. If I hire a car, I don’t have to buff the windows, wash the carpet, clean leaves out of the windscreen gutter, so why should I with a house I’ve rented. Sure, I should pay to repair damage and leave it clean, but the “bond clean” requirement is a rort that allows landlords to reallocate the bond to their marketing needs."
owner of property should have to pay bond too for maintenance and breaches
Not waiting so long for minor repairs to be carried out 
Consider landlord's rights - I often wonder if landlord's have any rights at all.
"Freedom to have pets. Some humans I've met are more destructive than house trained pets. If all damages are to be rectified by the tenant, what difference does it make if a dog destroys something or a child?

For those who have to share a house with other tenants, who are not family, having to be responsible for all tenants actions, even though they are on the lease, is unfair. "
Landlords should have more rights over their property 
Allow bond loans for people on any income.
Better incentives to owners of the rental property
"How Tenant's are screened for our properties and the rights they seem to have over us the home owners, along with contracts being able to stand up in court."
Environmentally friendly houses available for rent
Ensure maintenance is done promptly.
Allow tenants to stay indefinitely unless the landlord gives a specific reason for ending their tenancy.
From an investment property landlord owners perspective - rental reform not required.
Inspections can be an invasion of privacy and cause unnecessary stress if the property manager is rude or intimidating. 
"As a landlord who has specialised in adding new properties to the rental market, I am now discouraged from adding further properties to my portfolio by the seemingly endless attacks on my now poor return on my investment. Regulations cost me money. Interest rate discrimination costs me money. And while my return on investment continues to decline I face pressure from tenants' associations to cede control of my assets to the tenant with reduced protections against tenant misbehaviour. I fully expect to keep my properties in good condition and am generally accepting of tenant requests for minor modifications to suit, pets, etc. but I require in return prompt payment of a rent that gives me a reasonable return after overheads and I must retain the right to manage my assets effectively. Anything less and I shall have to exit this asset class and leave it to others to provide accommodation for tenants."
Stricter regulation of landlords and real estate agents. If tenants can be black listed the same should be true for agents and landlords
Allowing small pets
"More freedom to make the rental feel like a home through superficial changes like being able to hang photos or art, paint walls, etc. "
Tenants need representation! I am a disillusioned tenant and from conversations with other tenants know I am not alone. In my experience property managers represent and serve owners interests ONLY.
"I feel that there should be more accountability for landlords/property managers who breach the tenancy agreement. I think that a register of landlords that do not maintain their properties or increase the rent by a huge amount would be helpful to tenants looking for a property.
I have lived in the same rental property for 6 years. I am a good tenant who looks after the property and pays rent on time every week i have always had a battle to get things fixed- for example I went 6 months without lights in my family room because he said “the house is only a few years old and I shouldn’t be having to pay for things like that”. I know I can breach him and move but I don’t want to move, I like where I live and it’s expensive to move. For example why is there not an option for the landlord to be fined if they don’t repair things? If it’s going to cost them more money they will listen! 
I think current legislation is very much in favour of the landlord. I accept there are tenants out there who are not good, but most are good. I think the balance needs to be readdressed."
"real estate agents fees for landlords are very expensive, i would reduce the fees. "
Ability to modify the property within reason to make it more home-like. 
More rights for owners who try to do the right thing
"accountability for property manager agencies
They seem to do what they want and dont satisfy need of landlords or tenants 

Also vetting process for renters is terrible"
"clearer rules around fair wear and tear,"
"Tenants need to treat their rentals as their home.  Taking pride in their home and garden will improve their quality of life immensely.  The more tenants can do for themselves, and the less they demand, can only result in cheaper rents and better quality homes."
Renters need better protection
A dwelling should have to be held to a minimum standard before it is allowed to be leased. A building inspection should have to take place and anything that doesn't live up to the standard should be fixed/installed. Eg. Bathrooms without extraction fans should have them installed and roof leaks causing structural damage should have to be addressed.
Being authorised to do repairs myself rather than waiting for the agent/owner to organise.
Maintainance issues to be attended to and more support for tenants who are taken advantage of by property managers/real estate agency 
"A legislation that controls the real estate agents. putting properties up for rent before they are suitable, touching photo's up, safety certificates, minimum standards for all properties, energy efficiency standards. If you are renting in a value bracket, that bracket of value should represent the quality of the property. Not the fact that the owner is relying the tenant to resurrect dead landscapes, swamp like pools, bacteria infested A/C's for example. in most cases the properties inflated value has luxury items or holidays attached to it and they are wanting the tenant to pay for these. you shouldn't be asking $550 rent for a $350k property that has many. items that need repair. I understand that the tenant should be more responsible as well. But when a bond clean, curtain clean, carpets are more expensive than the bond, well who can really blame a tenant for just walking out. Businesses charge too much and with the properties in worse condition that the tenant has left it, there is a total lack of clarity here.  "
legal assistance as landlord when tenants trash the rented property
"As a property owner I find most tenancies go ok, but where a tenancy doesn't end well, bonds are not sufficient to cover damage and as an owner I can ne quite out of pocket even with insurance.  Tenants must be held accountable for the damage they do.  "
Real estate agents thinking keeping bond is just what you always do
Lower Rental prices especially for single and retired people
"nothing at this stage, quite happy with renting experience so far"
responsive real estate agents
"theres more than one thing! Rents are too high, its difficult to attend inspections, property managers are disinterested and lazy"
real estate communication
More regulation of property management company standards and more trust in tenants (eg. allowing pets and wall hangings).
"Agents and owners respond quicker when there is a problem,"
Better standard of service from real estate agents for both landlords and tenants. 
Better communication with rental management 
"More recognition in the system and in communications that there are really good landlords out there too;  there are landlords not 'flush with cash' or 'trying to rip anybody off'...simply good, honest families trying to invest in their future."
The processes for bond refund are unfair and leave tenants at mercy of unscrupulous agents.  Agents are able to abuse the refund and RTO dispute resolution processes to extend disputes and pressure tenants to agree to unfair claims.
Ability to keep pets. Have stayed in my current place despite wanting to move because I'm worried about being able to find a place that will accept my pets
Clear information in regard to owners rights.
"Find a real estate that evaluates people and their suitability in a fair manner. Nobody tells you that in QLD, to rent a house the rent must be no more then 30% of the combined income of the tenants. In lower demographic areas, and those who are afflicted by medical conditions and are stuck on some form of government payment, they do not stand a chance at renting due to the unspoken 30% rule that most Real Estates have in effect. In one case, i was lied too. I have evidence of a major Real Estate doing this to myself. They rejected my application citing that a better tenant was found and thank you for applying etc. Then days later one of their rental team called me up asking if I wished to inspect the property. I informed him that I had inspected already and had submitted a application and that I was informed the property was already rented out to a ""more suitable"" tenant. The real estate then scrambled and said they would call back. Then after making me get a financial guarantor, they approved me.  "
Make the rental rules more fair for all parties involved instead of being biased towards the tenants
"More rights for renters:
 - Possibility to rent for longer than 1 year at a time, not having to re-apply each year
 - Capability to change small things within the property with owner's permission
 - Higher standards for rental properties outdoors (fences have to be fixed up, exterior cleans regularly)"
"We would like realestate agents to care more and more houses that allow pets, and more reasonable prices for families struggling. Rent should be based on income."
"being able to make the property you are renting into a home. This can include adding material features such as pictures, curtains, etc. Not having to ask permission to have animals on the property, to a degree as the tenet should also abide by their local council laws."
"Knowing that I can evict (and would have the support of the police to do so) a bad tenant that causes damage to the property, is late in paying rent, or is causing nuisance to the complex."
"How the property is managed, communication issues"
To rent real estates work on 30% of income. Being on Newstart allowance for past 4 years when I have had GPs and specialist ask why I’m not on a disability pension but that comes down to Centrelink and suitability. It’s hard to rent without having to share whilst being on govt payment and automatically shunned upon. Even NRAS take working couples over sharing situation being on centrelink. I thought NRAS would help but it doesn’t.
"Property manager. From an owners and renters point of view. 
"
Getting the rent paid by the due date
"More accountability on tenants.  Residential land owners pay the majority of costs - i.e. rates, water, R&M.  Few costs are the responsibility of the tenant."
"More pet friendly housing needs to be available. There is no reason a fully tiled house with a fully fenced yard should not be pet friendly, but so many are on the Gold Coast. Laws need to change urgently "
"More long term stability with respect to leasing.  The ability to lock in a long term lease, but with clauses that allow you an  should your circumstances change"
"Change legislation to reflect the fact that a property is owned by the owner who should have more say in who uses the property. It is too hard to select good tenants who won't damage property. When property is damaged, it is far too hard to get compensation because of privacy issues or a reluctance to hold tenants accountable for their actions. The process to seek compensation is designed to blame the landlord from the outset. It is too hard to track down tenants who have absconded after damaging property or not paying rent. Tenants can stay in a property for far too long without paying rent. I agree that dodgy landlords should be caught and penalised, but it should also be equally possible to penalise dodgy tenants. After rules got tighter over the years, I stopped buying more rental properties and I have instead focussed on the share market. Less costs, less hassle, more income. Who can be bothered with tenant hassles. I agree that most tenants are very good. But you only need one really bad tenant that you can't bring to account, to sour your desire to be in the rental property market. More stringent legislation aimed at the owner will see more people exit the rental property industry. I notice below that the Yes No answers are designed to give a skewed view. Tenants generally treat a property as their home: what does that mean? I need to say No to demonstrate those who damage property, and yet most tenants don't. I'll go for Not Sure."
Mandatory vacate inspection to be conducted with the tenant on the day tenancy ends to avoid delay in bond return and avoid greedy owners trying to take bond money from tenants to improve their property at a later date
Encourage contact rather than phone mediation for dispute resolution by RTA.
More agent accountability when handing properties over in less-than-satisfactory condition because a vacating tenancy hasn't been finalized correctly. 
I don't see a need to change anything in particular.
I believe the one thing that needs improvement is the property management being more reasonable and understanding. I don't believe they are always fair when there is a dispute with the property or when you leave the property.
Tenants to be certain of their housing requirements ie rent and dwelling features to be suitable for their requirements
"Make it a profitable experience again.  We are getting out after 20 years - the addition of Land Tax, increased rates, increased insurance, fewer tax incentives, more power to tenants - all too much to ask.  "
"have the tenant pay the water costs directly, with a proportionate reduction in weekly rent"
Enforcement of non-smoking properties and noise bans during night time hours. 
"I was a landlord. When my property was being vacated and put up for sale, the property was vacated in a filthy condition which I never become aware of until feedback from a potential sale. When I wanted to report the real estate for what happened, I had virtually no rights at all"
Give owners an incentive to expand their number of rental properties
A more fair and quicker system to evict problem tenants that do not pay their rent and damage the property.
Maintenance always seems an issue.....Its seems alot of people I know who rent have a similar problem
"As a landlord, it disappoints me that the RTA is my geared towards tenants and as a landlord we do not get the same support.  Also now the RTA are refusing to put rental property addresses on the forms due to privacy - what a load of rubbish, when all this information is on the form.

Also we are just having a tenant break a lease, which is a legal binding agreement, and the RTA are telling the tenant that I need to find a new tenant in a reasonable time, the tenant signed a document to rent the property to a set date.  I can't revoke a lease, so why should the tenant be allowed to!!"
"Bond refund process, its too easy for property managers not to maintain fair wear and tear of premises during tenancy- only then to claim damages against the tenants bond upon vacating. If you make maintenance requests property managers make threats of breach notices, and non renewal of contracts"
Finding a good tenant who will not damage the property and pay the agreed rent
"Too long to get maintenance attended to
Real estates don't ring back to book viewings when the say they are going to 
Real estates don't often advise if an application has been declined leaving the clients to have to chase up
Real estates don't always follow through with correct paperwork on vacate to advise clients of outstanding debts - TICA listing without giving the tenants the opportunity to pay

"
QCAT's waiting time for a court appearance is too long and tenants are given a long time to vacate a property when not paying rent
Reduce council rates for owners. They are much higher than I pay in NSW.

Nothing as I have a good Agent who looks after the property.
improved processes around eviction due to non payment of rent and proven breaches of rental conditions.
"Having landlords do repairs - and in a timely manner. 
Have real estate agents follow through on a tenants request to have repairs done"
Have the tenant pay all the water charges including service access charges
"Not allowing pets, they cause damage to interior "
Have tenants act more responsibly and more pro-actively when it comes to repair issues.
I feel the currant laws are fair & reasonable
Being able to hang pictures on the wall and secure tall furniture to the wall. I dont mind fixing it afterwards. Also property managers are bullies and I feel unsettled with my life in their hands
"Ban leasing agents and remove their ability to list on TICA fraudulently!! (Force TICA listing to be done as part of a QCAT outcome, not done at whim of agent)"
"Make rules equitable and fair for landlords not just renters. If landlords are turned off from investing and offering their homes for rent, that'll put pressure on QLD government to offer its own housing solution. "
make the playing field fairer for landlords 
Qld Urban Utilities costs should be borne by Tennant
Better communication and involvement with real estate agent
Easier to resolve breaches 
Give home owners more rights when tenants do not respect the property and leave $$$ worth of damage.
"I am both a tenant and a landlord. I consider some landlords are unconcerned about making basic upgrades to a property and the rent goes up disproportionately. As a tenant in Brisbane I have had to pay water bills within 2 weeks, however as a landlord with a managed property in Gatton I never received the tenant's payment until the end of the following month.
"
"Fixing minor issues before they escalade.
"
The ability to make our rental property our home
Being able to choose payment periods - monthly rent payment is often not available or is not properly catered for in the rent payment ledger system. 
"Many real estate agents make it standard practice to increase the rent every time the lease is up for renewal (they are careful to ensure the increase is not so much that tenants could dispute it as an excessive rent increase, but it's so frequent that it becomes burdensome for the tenant). This is blatant profiteering - it is unjust & preys on tenants who are largely powerless (their only option being to move elsewhere, triggering moving costs). This practice should not be allowed. Another option may be to introduce longer-term leases, similar to those in Europe, where tenants have more rights."
Increasing penalties for property managers (or owners where they are managing the property themselves) where they are not complying with legislation and regulation. Including for minor issues as some property managers think they can drag their feet sorting out minor issues but when it drags out and there are multiple minor issues it all adds up.
Make it easierto get rentals with pets.
Better communication with owners
Application process and some of the exit criteria about how clean a house should be when ending a tenancy
Better access to information about potentially troublesome tenants before leasing a property
"To stop rental properties being on popular realestate websites with appalling standards of health, safety, hygiene,  plumbing,  repairs, etc, especially after being physically inspected once by potential tenants.
A foolproof mechanism need to be developed where only real would be renters will be able to advise of such sub standard properties and subsequent prompt shut down etc be enforced. This will rebuild confidence in the RTA, and already cash rich property owners not providing shoddy DIY etc houses in the market."
"Apply some common sense to placement of fire alarms and base it on the size of the house. I'm hearing that every bedroom is going to be required to have an alarm and then have another one in the hallway just outside. In my small house that will literally be 4 fire alarms within a 6 meter radius. If it was a massive house with bedrooms 15 meters apart ... OK, but in smaller houses this is overkill. 

Re Water and Sewerage: I understand that sewer use charges are not able to be passed onto the tenant, but water use can be passed on at 100% if the house is water conservation certified. Given sewerage is billed at 90% of actual water use, why can sewer use not be billed also? It is being used by the tenant, the same as electricity, gas, water etc. If the tenant uses less water he is charged less sewerage use. He has control ... not the landlord. It makes no sense that sewerage use fees are not recoverable. "
"I think that it a first in first served basis should be implemented when applying for a rental property through a Real Estate agent.  Higher income earners are obviously a safer option for property owners therefore always seem to be the first choice leaving the lower earning income family ie: single parents, pensioners with a lesser chance in finding a place to call home.  As Real Estate Agents have enough access to do background checks and enough time to conduct the necessary inspections and ensure rent is paid on time any approved applicant should be sufficient and should not need approval from the property owner.   However should a property owner wish to remain in control and have a choice of who they would like to rent their property they can do so privately.  I feel like this would deliver more equality in renting in Queensland. "
I’m happy with the current arrangements. 
Back to 6 monthsw in inspection for good tenants  more power points in new homes
Transition option for renters to purchase the property - I.e stamp duty reduction - agent commission reduction
"I think the ""no pet clause"" in many leases should be abolished. It should not be up to the landlord who or what lives in a house other people are paying money for. "
Stop requiring landlords to pay for water used by tenants.
Better laws to protect the owner for tennant damage
"Dispute resolution for 'share' or multi-tenant agreements where one tenant (whether co-signatory or not) wishes to terminate their involvement in the overall agreement.
Coinciding with this, with changes to household structures and the prevalence of 'sharing' to afford suitable housing (whether for location, amenity or accessibility), rules should be considered on how to better manage 'share' accommodation overall.
Greater access to periodic payment lease agreements may assist in flexible termination of 'shared' arrangements should one or several sharers seek to exit the arrangement."
"Rental bond process, having to pay bond to find a new residence and then having to wait for old bond to be returned can take a big financial toll"
More income the yield is very low and no capital gain
Tenants demand perfection
"Land rights for all human beings so that nobody would ever be homeless or victim to parasites otherwise known as landlords. Charging people rent to live on the earth or making them buy a piece of the earth is a denial of a human beings intrinsic right to exist on the earth. Our current legal system of property ownership is an ongoing form of bullying, victimisation, exploitation and slavery. We will never have a 'fair go', equality or social justice so long as people are given greater privilege based on excuses like who got there first, who is older, who had wealthy/powerful parents, who is more popular, who is more attractive, bigger, stronger, smarter, has greater capacity etc. Everyone should have the sense of security of knowing that there is a safe space where they can exist in peace, even the opportunity to be self-sufficient if they choose. The added stress that comes from dispossession makes people lives more difficult, and leads to self harm and suicide when people feel that life is so difficult that they no longer want to live. It is a cold nasty society that leaves people homeless and vulnerable to maintain privilege for some.
Given how unjust the entire system is, the government should grant a block of land to every new born child. Otherwise, Public housing should be made available to all people that do not own a property, regardless of income, as a guaranteed lifetime lease, with supply to suit demand and requirement for no. of bedrooms etc. Everybody should have a choice of housing styles including detatched, terrace, villa, town, flat or unit. Nobody should be forced into a studio or unit, even if they are a single male.

A Larger amount of a bond to cover damage to property
Better Registration qualifications for property managers working in RE Agencies.
Owners going through an agency.
One form for all realestate agents so you don’t have to continually fill out new forms and being able to move your bond with each new rental regardless of agent. 
Better accountability of real estate agents managing the properties
"More transparency.
Property Managers need ro learn better customer service.
Repairs and complaints need to be acknowledged and acted apon"
"currently nothing, I have a great real estate and tenant"
"I have been a tenant & a landlord. As a landlord I have used agents & also managed the properties myself. The balance between landlord & tenant's rights needs to change in favour of the landlord. Seeing properties being trashed by tenants & then the landlord having so much difficulty in moving the tenants out is outrageous. Maybe agents need to audited as some landlords appoint agents because they are no longer residing in the area, and rely on the agents to ensure the properties are in good condition, & some agents fail at this. Other agents are over the top with applying strict rules on tenants. Also the timelines for tenants & agents is out of balance eg in terms of notice etc."
Have the tenant more accountable to damages or repairs caused by the tenant. 
"Most of real estate agent are liars and they do not care about the property condition or is suitable to live the in and they always want to increase the rent, why ? "
"I'm not renting now. I have in the past though. Now I'm on the other side renting to others.  We have had what real estates call good tenants. I'm not overly impressed though. (Still could be worse I have seen the real horror stories - we haven't had that).
When I was renting I would treat the places with care. I tried to treat the place as if I owned it, I'd get most things fixed myself if it needed fixing. We would tidy the yard, trim the bushes and trees, do dump runs. We even got asked if we had a new oven installed for one of the places when we left. No, we just cleaned it properly. Apparently that's a rare thing."
"Prompt rectification if something important breaks, like aircon in summer"
Better property value and sustainable rental costs. better rental return.
The way as a renter the real estate treat tenants with regards to time repairs to essential services and equipment supplied in the tenancy. An example to compare against would a rental car if it breaks down or the air condition didn't work then it would be replaced repaired almost immediately. And they are also supplied absolutely clean.
Better understanding from the RTA and QCAT
Taking away the threat of being placed on the Tika list by unscrupulous agents and landlords.
More properties to allow pets.
"Require leasing agents to adhere to and advertise with any property, a tenant based property rating system similar to TripAdvisor and other ratings for overnight rentals."
Restrict landlords from creeping rent up with every lease renewal
We rented a house when it was fenced and it was removed the day before we moved in resulting in us adding a fence. The landlord was a snooper. The locks never worked
Ability to evict tenants at shorter notice when a breach has been made by them. More power to get them to pay rent in arrears.  Make it illegal for agents to charge to go to QCAT - they are the ones who found the tenant and supposedly vetted them in the first place. This is a nice little earner for  them at the landlord's expense and the adjudicator was not aware that the landlord was being charge an hourly rate for the agent to represent them.  What a rip-off!  Now we can't locate the tenant to recoup the rent he owes.
tenants need to pay on time ie water excess bills and if not should be be a cost penalty
Protect tenants from landlord's who list properties for sale with the option to sell to an owner occupier. For example; my experience in 2018 within 6 weeks of moving into a townhouse and in 2017 within 5 months of moving into a unit.
"Property managers. Very arrogant and ""I'm in charge"" so don't mess with me or you'll be homeless attitude."
Very hard to get decent tenants
"To be able to have pets without any problems.
Allowed to place prints and photos on the walls.
Not to feel like to you have to beg to acquire a rental property."
Making sure that ALL Property Mangers were as diligent about their work (ie knowing the rules and regulations of the day) as I was and that my current agents are.
"As a landlord, I would change the rules about tenants doing minor repairs to the property.  For example, a tenant is not allowed to change a light bulb or fix a loose handle which only needs a few turns of a screwdriver."
buy a cheaper property which would mean a smaller investment loan
The attitude of the property managers. I’ve been renting in Brisbane for 10 years and not once have I been satisfied with the service from my property manager
"More pet friendly properties, including inside. We know how much pets improve our mental health, and a lot less pets would end up in animal shelters if people could keep their pets with them. I personally rely on my dog who is trained to aid me in panic attacks and moments of severe mental distress, yet I find it difficult to find a property that will accept a large dog, and no properties allow pets inside.

"Not being discriminated against because eg: having pets, being on a government pension, having to get a bond through the Community Housing Department. "
A reputable agent with competent property management

"Having my dogs inside, having more animals e.g. chickens, small farm animals that need a home e.g. pigs, goats etc. Renting 5 acres.
Less frequent inspections...mine are every 12 weeks"
Pet friendly would be the best change to the renting people. Thanks
"as a landlord renting my property through registered agents, i have been ripped off by tenants numerous times, with rent unpaid, place left a mess with rubbish everywhere, walls and windows smashed, and i am the one who pays because bond is inadequate or tenant can't be found. i have got a good agent now wheo is discerning who they rent the property to.
as a renter, i am generally happy, depending on the agent; i have had lazy agents in the past"
I'd like to have a pet and hang pictures without needing permission.

Allowing companion animals to live there. 
"Sick and Tired of Real Estate Managing  my property not doing there job properly, I flick agents nearly every change over. 

$7559.50 land tax bill, each year, I thought having rental property was a good decision but It is not. and depending on the outcome of this, will depend on if I sell more of my Queensland rental property's 

Tenants trashing property's, and being told its fair ware and tare  "
Owners taking care of property also especially when they have a good long term tenant.
"We are good tenants and we are also landlords. The houses that we own are unfortunately not located where we want to live and we move regularly. We always do a bond clean that leaves the house looking better than it did when we left it. Yet every single time we move, the agents try and take our bond from us. There have been situations where we've moved into a house that clearly hasn't been cleaned properly for us, yet we have to clean it to vacate?!?! If the previous tenants get their bond taken from them, where is the proof that the money gets used for cleaning / maintenance? Also we should be allowed to leave the house in the same manner as how we found it, not be expected to have it better just because the agents didn't organise a cleaner."
"Being able to get bond back when leaving a property in Mackay. After being a long term tenant it is almost impossible to get bond back because ""fair wear and tear "" is open to interpretation and it is a battle to prove it. The properties aren't immaculate when rented and aren't maintained by landlord duri g rental period but they have to fix it up to rent it again and that cost should not fall on previous tenant unless they have caused damage etc"
"It should be easier to evict a bad tenant eg not paying rent, damaging the  property or being threatening and abusive"
"I would make 'Notice to leave (Form 12)' a registered (with RTA) and enforced form.
Why? Currently Landlords and Real-estates may issue a Notice to leave form 60 days prior to a lease coming up for renewal, and then using this as leverage to request a lease renewal with set length and conditions, if the tenant won't accept the new conditions or lease length then the realestate simply chooses to enforce the unconditional Notice to leave after withdrawing the offered lease. This is open to abuse and places the tenants under duress. This is both surreptitious (because using this form is not registered with anyone and may be withdrawn at will because it's not enforced once logged. The practice is pernicious as it causes harm to renters leaving them with no choice or avenue to appeal whilst also damaging communities by forcing renters to potentially vacate possibly during school terms or before work or contracts have completed and also breaking down relationships in local communities as a result."
"Tenants to be treated like customers/clients buying a service. All too often, tenants are treated as lessor persons to the landlord/owner by agents. It's as though tenants/lessees are privileged to live in the owners/lessors properties. In my situation, I choose to lease high quality properties (even though I can afford to buy) but am often treated as a lessor party in the economic exchange. Too many rules for the tenants with little for the owners. "
Pets allowed wherever possible
Too much onus is placed on the owner instead of the tenant to take basic responsibility for themselves.  Everything is in favour of the tenant.  It is becoming far too difficult to be a landlord in Qld.  Our family has been providing affordable housing for many years and we are considering getting out of it as it is no longer worth it because of increasing rules and conditions imposed by government.  
Allowing families to have a pet.
"For the most part, renting has been good. There has been one time where a real estate agent tried to violate our rates, but when we got the RTA involved, they backed off."
Every property has been a maintenance nightmare. Every property has been filthy when we've moved in. The agent from our first property told the next agent we were not good tenants as we required repairs to be done. despite us renovating the garden and repairing heaps of issues and leaving the property in amazing condition and never being even a day late with rent. The agent informed us there is a way they do this but accepted us anyway. Now we have a form 11 and 16 and are awaiting qcat on this property as there are no fly screens and many repairs required. Again we've always paid our rent and completed met our obligations. 
"Rental property owners have no rights - tenants have all the rights.  A lease is worthless piece of paper because it does not hold the tenant to anything - like paying rent, paying to replace broken items/damage to property, sticking to the lease agreement, paying rent for the duration of lease - instead of just walking out whenever they want with no consequences.  QCAT is the most useless piece of legal rubbish that there is - may as well not have it.  For a landlord there is no point owning a property if you can't make money on it and you can't make money on a rental property if the tenant is allowed to ignore the lease conditions as they wish including just not paying the rent.  I would change the rules so that tenants must to abide by lease conditions - and not use leases as toilet paper.  Tenants have too many rights at present and landlords have none. "
After a year of renting and with a no major infringements to your inspections the rate of inspections should be no more than six month period or a month before lease renewal.privacy and enjoyment of your home should be respected.
"Improve the ability to apply for rental properties online. Often we are moving to locations far away from our previous address, and it is almost impossible to schedule open houses in order to apply.

Also, pet friendly accommodation is a massive issue for me and many other friends of mine who rent. I have been renting with pets for 14 years and never had any issues in regards to damage or complaints, yet it is still difficult to find pet-friendly accommodation. It is frustrating and unfair, and I sincerely believe that most damage to properties is caused by humans and not pets. I would also be more than happy to pay for any repairs if required - and after all, isn't the bond a security against this anyway?"
"property manager access to a routine inspection with a form 9 should not give them an absolute right to enter on the date they have nominated,...this should be negotiable. My property manager tried to force his way into my home when I was very sick and could not grant access. He did not want to negotiate another day & said it was his absolute right to come to the inspection on the day he nominated!"
"More support from authorities in the case of bad tenants.
Land tax to be based on the rent received, because currently it is based on land value, and although the land value can be high, the rent could be very low and it is unfair to have a tax that are not based on income received.
If the land is sold, there will be a sales tax to be paid anyway."
"allow pets. People are allowed to have feral children but I am single and want to have a dog or cat and not allowed. I am very clean and tidy. Plus some tenants even without children are drug addicts or alcoholics and don't look after the property. There is no incentive or reward to the good tenants that do look after the house as if it is their own. Also, being allowed to hang pictures or a mirror would make a big difference. "
Fewer inspections and more general maintenance including outside with large trees
Things getting fixed when reported. Instead of the rent going up when we request. 
Improve the application process when looking for rental property's
"The right to secure home and tenancy of my choosing, property cannot be sold out from underneath me and I have the right to change locks and no-one can come in without my approval at any time."

As a owner of a Rental property more assistance with Bad Tenants on debt recovery.
"When the bond does not cover the damage to property and the tenant leaves without a forwarding address,the landlord should be able to track down the tenant to serve papers on them to recoup the loss"
Allowing pets at rental property
"As a landlord, having a more stringent criteria for selecting a tenant and to make it easier to evict a tenant who breaches the tenancy agreement that they signed, especially when malicious damage has occured."
There is a bias favouring tenants in Queensland.
"inspections. when one first rents a property it should be compulsory for three monthly inspections, but as time goes on the inspections should be less frequent. when one is still at the same property for 1 year the inspections should be every four months, and after two years the inspections should be five months... 6 months should be the maximum length of time between inspections
The inspections are quite inconvenient as time has to be taken off work and the idea of people touching your things is quite offputting."
Have a minimum standard that rental properties have to be maintained. Have a agency that renters can contact and will inspect and advise renters if their concerns are genuine and them take the matter up with the LANDLORDS to have the premises brought up to standards  
Increase renters rights
Property that has trees over 2 meters: The land lord should have to trim these trees when they are out of control @ the tenants request and any tree that has been dropped whether recent or pre the current landlord the landlord should have to have the stumps of  these trees ground down below ground level.
"The amount of personal information demanded by real estate agents is totally unacceptable.
They do not need to have a copy of a prospective tenant's bank statement nor know their income.
They do not need to know your age nor have a copy of your photo I.D.
In previous years, renting a place, meant meeting the agent and signing and witnessing the contract.
Perhaps you had to nominate your place of work.
This demand is really an invasion of privacy and must be made illegal and enforced.

In any case, it should be mandatory that the owner's name, address and details be provided prior to any contract being signed given that a prospective tenant must do this (and provide references) even if they are not accepted.
If owners demand personal information then it should be reciprocated for the prospective tenant.



"
"The Bond process, it is drawn out."
"More accountability to the Landlord.   Trying to get things fixed that were broken prior to moving in should not be as difficult as it is.   The only way some of things were fixed was to mention that they were in breach.  
Trying to find a house as a single female and a small dog was extremely difficult.  Families became precedent (which I do understand) and then to be questioned why I would need a house.   The house is needed due to the dog, thought that would be a no brainer; apparently not so.   A good thing has been I have an amazing Real Estate Agent that has assisted me."
Make it mandatory for leases to be able to go to month to month terms after a standard fixed amount of time (i.e. one year).

Tenants should be responsible for some of the ongoing wear and tear repairs and maintenance
"Changing the cost of renting, renter's are paying basically 99% of the owners mortgage.
I don't think it's fair to be paying rent the same cost as a mortgage and rent should be at least half the price on paying someones mortgage."
Rental agreement portal for landlords and tennants so forms can by signed and up loaded online.
"I reside in NSW, and so I don't get many opportunities to view the property first hand.  Perhaps if the Agent was able to provide updated photo's or a video of the property, say every 6 months, then I could certainly see how the property is being maintained, keep the tenants on task in maintaining the property whilst they are there, and even view opportunities for improvement or repair.  This might place a bit more pressure on both the owner and the tenant to maintain the property, lifting the standards for both parties."
Hard to make tenants accountable
Ability to have pet/s and hang items on walls

The period of notice that the landlord must give to the tenant before a periodic lease can be ended.
"Introduction of rent control. As costs keep rising and pensions slide further behind, we now pay 47% of our money to rent each fortnight, resulting in diminishing disposable income over the long term. This situation is ultimately unsustainable for most renters."
"I wish I could be guaranteed that my lease would be renewed so that I could treat my rental like a home, and that the rent wouldn't rise more than 1% per year. I wish I could treat my rental like a home, to hang stuff up and make minor improvements, and to have a pet. "
Make owners more responsible and responsive to fixing property defects
make entry condition reports mandatory for landlords to send out but not tenants to return so that a landlord is not disadvantaged by a tenant not returning or singing the entry condition report as is currently the case
Improved regulation on animals/pets in rental properties. 
Have better real estate company’s that manage your property closely. 
Realestate high exit condition standards to keep bond money. 
Tenants do damage and are not made to pay for it
Make it easier for tenants to have pets (cats in particular) - particularly when Council laws prevent cats from being outside at all (day or night) - Townsville where I live has these laws.
Finding a good RE Agent
It would be nice if the real estate agents didn't treat the tennants as second class citizens.
Change all renting rules and conditions to match most other states. Being out on your own makes it very difficult to manage properties in Qld. Looking at selling all Qld properties as it is too difficult to operate in Qld.
"Be better able to bargain for a decrease in rent when prices have become more competitive. That is, my rent currently cannot be reduced even though rental prices in my suburb are more competitive and the apartment is ageing with every year that passes."
Agencies should all use the online application system in order to speed up the application and reward process.
"Queensland is a very volatile market and seems to have very large swings in regards to housing prices and consequently the returns from rents is also volatile, especially in the country arena. "
Reinstalling the law that allows depreciation on new properties to be claimed even if you are the second owner
"Less inspections every 3 months is so invasive , it’s a reminder that it is not your home and you feel like you are just staying there . Been in our house for 3 years now and not once has there been any damage caused by us and the house is ways spotless "
"Availability of more rental properties in good areas
"
Time restrictions for owners to repair maintenance 
"Remove pet approval requirement.

It should be up to the tenant to ensure they maintain their property during tenancy and upon exit- as per normal Bond requirements."
"Give more encouragement to landlords to improve their properties, in terms both of quality fittings and water reimbursement."
Rules for returning or using bonds
"To be able to RELAX AND FEEL LIKE IT IS A HOME (not just a house) . e.g. being allowed to put pictures on walls and NOT have Real Estate Inspections every 3 months!
I think it is fair enough that the first inspection be at 6 weeks and then again in 3 months. But, once they can see you are not looking after the property/house well, then inspections should only be 6 monthly (or even yearly)."
"RTA is heavily weighted towards bureaucracy and in favour of the tenant without due regard to potential damage to the property and the cost of the passage of time. While the need for fairness is acknowledged, the processes for removing a con-man tenant are too long"
Consistent exit and entry inspection. Pets allowed inside 
"Consistency with QCAT decisions and interpretation of the Act within and across regions, and who is adjudicating on the day."
"Notice periods, inspection frequency, pets."
More rights especially for long term tenants regarding pets and being able to personalise their home.
"Squatters rights should be eliminated, the owner should have more rights than the tenant"
"More accessible places, every time i move i spend months trying to find a rental with a roll-in shower with no lips, this time i've been looking for two months. If you go to realestate dot com and search for min 2b2b rentals for greater Brisbane you get nearly four thousand results, use the key word 'wheelchair' and you get just four results! Then of those four, three only have wheelchair access through the front door as they have a lift, which just leaves one which is sadly too far out of town. You are then forced to use other key words like, wheel, mobility, disability, disabled, elderly which each get back few results and after doing all that, like above only one of those have a roll in shower. But again it's too far out of the town. However there is a exception to this as a lot of apartments that are the most expensive $600-$1000p/w have lip free, luxury walk-in/ roll-in showers. If i would to change one thing i would stop allowing the term 'wheelchair accessible' just because there is a lift or you can get through the front door and use more particular terms like 'lift', 'elevator', 'wide hallways' and 'lip fee shower' so people who require this don't have to look through every single picture of each listing, which many don't have pictures of the shower or bathroom. The end result had been i have been forced to apply for housing because there is nothing in the private market or there is no way to find them without spending hours a day going through every new listing"
wear and tear needs to be the tenants' responsibility to avoid rather than something an owner needs to put up with while watching tenants create damage one step at a time
"The tenants should have to abide by the rules. If a tenant wants to break a lease they should have to do what it states in the lease (that they signed). Why can a tenant take it to court because they don't want to pay rent? A tenant should not be able to get out of paying what they have to because of breaking a lease.
Take away the avenue that currently is in place for tenants to make a court claim.
If the tenant chooses to break the lease the steps should be simple - but unfortunately it isn't and it costs the owner money to try to retrieve money owing. Our mortgage still has to be paid, we don't get any reprieve."
More useful information available regarding selection of suitable tenants 
"I would make it so that property owners actually have to provide a clean, functioning property before putting their property up for a tenancy through agents. I have inspected/rented several properties where the living space has been disgusting, lights not working, doors not opening, mouldy carpets etc. 
I would also hope that renting prices were capped so that owners and agents could not increase the price whenever they see fit, so that housing can remain affordable."
"All rental property should have to be registered through RTA, this registration list should be open website for all potential tenants viewing to ensure Landlords/real estate agents are not going to take advantage of renting people eg taking bonds for fare wear and tear,Keeping rent in advance, poor maintenance scheduled, "
Pets and giving more allowances to renters instead of the rental property managers being like dictators when tentanta are good
"As a tenant I would ask that repairs & maintenance issues  be attended to in a timely manner. I have dealt with agencies where as a tenant I've been given the ""3rd"" degree with electrical issues! 

Now as a rental property owner I'm finding that I can't even have my garden maintained, I need to attend to this at my cost, after giving the required entry notice. I'm asked to do repairs, but, having given the entry notice I arrive at the approved time to find the tenant in bed & therefore I can't carry  out the repairs."
"It'd be great to see landlords actually do maintenance to the property's instead of letting them get run down by not fixing things, yet still they expect to increase the rent and charge phenomenal rents for subpar properties. "
"To properly deal with the large number of recalcitrant agents, who get rid of tenants to gain a benefit from re-renting property. One case in Cairns sees the agent turning over 300 tenancies every year. Gains a benefit of in excess of $100,000. Same with Town to Country in Ravemshoe and Campbells Real Estate in Innisfail."
"Recovery of unpaid rent is close to impossible - the notice periods, QCAT process and obtaining an enforcement order takes a period significantly more than the allowable bond."
"More options to ensure tenants do not leave a property with debt, tougher laws and consequences. "
A number of things actually but the most important thing would be to ensure that more rental accommodation allowed pets.
More protection for the landlords property after a tenant has not paid rent or damaged the property.3
I have always had great landlords. Although I think the entry/exit reports do not always equal out. E.g we rented a place that was filthy as the owners kids had been living there but they expected it to be bond cleaned upon leaving 
"All landlords must have a deposit for repairs for every property held with the RTA. 

Loss of license for agents AND principals for failing to act on breach notices. "
Bond refund quicker if everything is ok
The number of properties that allow pets (in my case two cats) is abysmal. I'd like to see fewer limitations around having a pet in a rental property.
"Rental agencies being held accountable for looking after tennents, replying to tennents and actually doing their job. Rental agencies and real estate agents should be black listed. "
Simple repairs can be done by tenants. Example nailing a fence panel 
Rent should not go up just because the lease is due. If you are looking after the property . As in weed and feed. Basic maintenance.  Watering and gardening as this all costs the tenants for the benefit of the owners
Better quality tenants
Create apartment blocks for non smoking residents only.
More transperancey and freedoms from the land lords and rental agency as well 
Require Property Manager qualifications for all property managers.
"Price for housing quality. I pay a lot of money for a furnished house but all of the furniture is old, damaged and the owner won’t move it, the owner won’t complete any maintenance requests but expects the house to be pristine on inspections."

Easier ways to deal with maintenance/better attendance to maintenance concerns
Ability to alter the property as long as it's returned to the original state when the tenant departs.

 Tenants and lessors should provide equal length of notice for vacating property.
"Consultation between the property manager regarding Form 9 Entry.  I want the right to be able to change the date if not convenient
Open house after giving the property manger the Form 13 should not be allowed as the property is not in a condition to be shown, this is unfair on the tenant
Owners should not be allowed to put the property on the market in under 12 months of new tenants moving in, at present they can sign a lease with a new tenant then put the house on the market 2 months later.
Be allowed to have pets in a house"
"The bond refund process is continually horrible - Real Estates are openly not following procedure and when I recently contacted the RTA I was not notified of the time frame to contest a claim on my bond and I've now lost almost $1,000 in bond. "
"1. It's crazy the renter is responsible for the payment of the rent until a new renter is found if they give notice on the contract. It is the decision the of landlord to make money through property as with any business they should take responsibility for the associated risks. Generally renters are in a more vulnerable financial positions than landlords so there is a question of equity of power too. 
Also the Real Estate should not handle the check in and check out process. It should be an independent 3rd party (inventory company) as it gives them too much control and an opportunity to demonstrate unfair behaviour in relation to you and bond return. "
Greater accountability for damage to property by tenants
More standardized training for property managers so that they are equipped with the knowledge and training that they need to ensure equal treatment and information is being supplied to all owners/tenants.
Nothing - plenty of rights as a tenant.
Dishonest real estate agents who tell lies to both owners and tenants to try and make themselves look good/honest they turn owners and tenants against each other with their lies.
Leaes for mulitple years as standard 
Have more effective options to recover missing rents when tenants failed to pay and run away. 
"'I would like to see better safeguards for landlords.  Currents laws favoured the tenants leaving landlords out of pocket.  RTA being an arbitrator and holder of bond moneys does nothing to ensure that landlords are treated fairly.  
Better safeguards include : 
- Bonds amounting to at least 6 weeks rent to cover most things tenants fail to do such as repair damages, unpaid rent for the last week of their tenancy and cleaning.

"I think agents get paid too much and don’t necessarily look after tenant or landlord as much as they look after themselves. An agent will suggest a rent increase, they tell the tenant, tenant leaves and landlord picks up the bill."
"Make it easier and cheaper for landlords to be properly reimbursed for damage cause. Not talking about wear and tear here, but holes in walls, doors etc. "

"Rental agents need to do their job properly - they need a significantly better understanding of the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords especially as it relates to the legislation.

"Property managers are just so rude, can we legislate kindness?  "
"My last renting experience I was made to pay $400 out of my bond towards general property maintenance (real estate agreed we left the property in excellent condition and should not have paid a thing) with the threat of trying to claim more if we went to court (which I would have had to pay the application cost for). The mediator told us if we went to court the judicator would likely make us pay half the amount the property owner was asking for regardless of whether we should actually pay it or not. If we are told by a real estate the property is in excellent condition, and the tenancy act says the property owner needs to pay for general maintenance, the tenant should be protected against property owners trying to claim the bond. Furthermore, if the property owner wants to claim the bond they should have to pay the court application fees, and the court shouldn't just be halving the costs to solve an issue quickly and dissuade people from using court processes. "
Requiring owners to fix issues in a reasonable timeframe and agents to be more responsive to renters problems and individual health and medical circumstances.
Better protection for landlords
make it law for owners and real estate agents to obey the rules set out in a lease agreement like the tenant has to
We got a rental breach noted because of oil on our driveway. We are good renters and are now at least a month ahead. We have been renting with the same agent for almost 8 years and when I asked for a ledger this was clearly shown on it.  One misdemeanor in 8 years shouldn't be recorded.

Bigger punishments for dodgy property managers. 
"The safety of myself and children, when it comes to looking for a decent rental."
The way agents manage inspections e.g during working hours. When you organize time off to attend an inspection and they cancel it or reschedule it. Some agents don't even turn up for the inspection.
The enforcement of laws around legal advice and documentation property managers provide and purposely misuse and abuse to disadvantage tenants.

The rights of the landlord regarding maintenance and/or damage to the property
tenants eviction for non payment of rent
"The ability to have a pet dog in the rental, and the ease in requesting permission. Responsible dog owners should be allowed to have a pet in the place they are renting. I think permission needs to be obtained, but a landlord should not be allowed to say no unless there is a very good reason, ie., the renters have a bad history. Risks around pets in a rental property can be mitigated by paying an extra 'pet' bond and by including clauses in the contract about the extra cleaning that needs to happen when they move out, ie,. steam cleaning the carpets"
"That the Government and the Court System be made fair for Landlords.  The RTA has recently made it almost impossible for Owners to ensure that Tenants look after our properties and pay for the property to be left in the condition it was in when they moved in, fair wear and tear excluded. An example is the decision not to allow Owners and Tenants to enter into agreements to steam clean carpets, curtains etc. The courts long ago lost the ability to obtain restitution from Tenants for damage done.  Owners can not obtain restitution through the Court System economically and without excessive waste of time and money.  Owners are considered bottomless pits, capable of sustaining endless costs for repairing their property."
"Maintenance issues to be fixed quicker.
Not having to pay $800 to have a sharp broken tree removed myself when the owner said it was my responsibility."
Not having to pay the renters water usage. 
"Make it easier to get rid of tenants. I own an investment property to make money, not provide social housing."
"The documentation for appointing an agent who rents out rooms in the property to separate parties is not adequate.
An agent appointment form that covers this option is needed.
The agent is using the rooming accommodation agreement, but this fails to pass on responsibility of the living room and other common areas to tenants. 
The charging of utilities costs is also not adequately covered. This has resulted in the agent charging an exorbitant amount and pocketing it."
"RTA advice - it changes with every person you speak to and mediation isn't impartial at all - as a property manager, we deserve the same level of respect that is given to the tenant through the mediation process. This isn't happening. "
Real estate agents!
Property manager communication 
"Most property managers are great, but if a house goes up for sale more communications is needed between the selling agent an property manage"
"I would do away with ""no grounds"" notice to leave form 12. My property manager sent me this form 2 months before end of my lease along with a new 12 month lease only. When I asked for a shorter lease, they just said I don't have a choice, sign or leave. This feels very unfair and I feel under duress to sign a lease extension for a length I don't want. "
"Property Agents only considering owners as their clients and always favouring the owners. I have moved 4 times in the past 5 years and every time experienced the same. As a tenant, I always felt isolated, cornered and being pushed to the wall. "
easier to read tenant ledgers and more transparent or education on how to be better tenant
Rights improved for landlords
"1. pre-inspection report provided by the real estate agent, not comprehensive nor pointing out conditions of premises
2. maintenance and services charges passed on to us after reporting issue of hwu sitting in water, only point out as part of the contract we were required to sign stating notify agent of faults or concerns of the property from a maintenance point of view, we sent photos and explanation of the hwu and they decided to send out a plumber we never said we were having issues with hot water.  Just the unit was continually leaking water out of the hwu and it was sitting in water against the footing of the townhouse."
"Maintenance of property structural and grounds, including standing appliances should be reviewed to determine if they are working effectively. All maintenance issues applicable to being rectified by the owner should be addressed immediately. It is unfortunate that tenants have to wait for months before an issue is seen to.  "
that ALL locks are changed every time a new tenant leases a premises as I have had past tenants enter my house when I have been at work and also asleep with keys they didn't hand back 
I think the default for rentals should be the ability to have a pet. This was very difficult for us when we last rented.
Owners or agents allowing pets
It’s hard to inspect a property when one becomes available due to limited inspection times and multiple people submitting applications. Somecreal estates treat me initially as a renter with rudeness. Little do they know that I am also a landlord. 
Improve tenants rights.
"Having to notify your current landlord 4-6 weeks before the lease ends if you are staying or going. They email and expect the
New lease back quickly, therefore finding a new home so far in advance is too hard.. as they are mostly ‘available now’.. can’t afford to pay double rent if the dates don’t align.. "
Stability in rents as rental income has continued to drop over past 8 years in northern Qld making it difficult for investors.
Longer tenancy make them more permanent at the moment most people move twice a year even thought they are never behind in rent. If an agent dosnt like you you will have to move with no reason given except the owner is not renewing the lease.
"My landlord dictated when they were going to inspect the property, and if I wasn't there they were going to let themselves in."
Renters have more rights to what gets fixed and when in a rental 
The paperwork that the agent requires when applying to rent is too invasive about my income and assets
"If pets not allowed, it should be stated in rental listing, so I don't waste time/money attending inspections and applying, only to be told pets not allowed when my application received."
Remove the need for higher rates for rental properties.  Just gets transferred through to tenant 
"if lease not signed before lease expires as tenant is holding back cannot increase rent for 6 weeks, period of notice starts 6 weeks latter.  "
Use an agent as people come up with all sorts of excuses not to pay the rent
More accountability for landlords/owners maintaining and keeping property in good repair. Enforcement mechanisms for those that do not do what is required 
The no reason end of a lease. 
Making it harder for tenants to break leases and not being responsible for paying the rent until a new tenant is found because of certain reasons
"Rules about pets being allowed

Real estate agents/owners won't fix problems with property, usually waiting for the end of lease to charge the tenant for the maintenance

Upon leaving a rental, real estate agents turn nasty"
There should be a standard minimum time of notice before an eviction or end of tenancy whether it is in a contract or not.
"By giving more than 28days to vacate a property, once the notice to vacate the property has been given for any reason. "
Allow more transparency in the process to resolve disputes
Allowing us to have pets would mean a lot to our family. 
Better flexibility with pets and making the house your own as well as long term lease 
I cant think of anything
Better control over fees charged to owners by property managers.
"I have rented in Queensland as a tenant for 10 years and also owned a property in Brisbane which I rented out through the RTA guidelines.
Unfortunately I had a bad rental experience when the Police raided the property as a result of the tenant storing and distributing narcotics on the premises.
I was dismayed when I called the RTA and found out that I could not evict the tenants even though the tenant was in jail! I was told that even though my property had been used for a crime, the only way I could legally evict my tenants (who had also destroyed the property) was to wait until they stopped paying rent for two weeks.

This is completely unfair on the owners. Other owners and tenants I have spoken to are amazed by this fact. 
I would like the laws to change so that if the Police charge a tenant with a crime that has occurred on the premise then the landlord can immediately evict with two weeks notice. 
I understand that on the balance, people charged with crimes need a place to live, but if the premises was used for the purposes of the crime the tenancy should be ended immediately."
Landlords require better protection from the law.
"A more uniformed & fair pricing system. Most properties are not worth the money rental agencies ask for them.
Property repairs should be made & regularly checked to a decent standard."
Confidence in the soundness of the structure of the building
Need to standardise the way property managers operate. Some are quite flexible in the way they work with tennants but some can be quite punitive towards the tennant.
"Allowing tenants to own pets, as long as we keep the rental clean this shouldnt be an issue. Also by making rental prices more fair. There should be set prices based on suburbs & bedroom amount."
Requests for maintenance should be attended to when requested. Less inspections after a certain time of proof of keeping the property in good condition.
"You rent the place, sign the lease - the place MUST meet these expectations at all times, things break they must be fixed.  Mould issues (due to poor insulation) must be fixed.  Basic wear and tear need to fixed by the landlord.  Sign a lease with no pet don't expect the landlord to change.
Likewise the tenant leaves the place in good condition.  Whoever is on the lease occupies the residence."
3 monthly real estate checks. This makes one feel a lack in agency and autonomy over their home they are renting 
Inconsistent property management standards.  Both as a tenant and a landlord
Less time to give a tenant notice to leave when they haven't paid rent. 
"Tenants have a better say in rental reviews, prior to the commencement of a new tenancy. The agents seem to default to an automatic increase in rent, without consideration to the current market or reductions in cost of borrowing funds."
Minimum air conditioning requirement.
Clear rules for tenants and more accurate compulsory photographic condition of entry reports. More safeguards for landlords. Protection for Landlords against Property Managers who fail to do their job. Reinstate the ability to claim travel expenses to view and maintain our property.
The ridiculously high costs!
Time lines for change of tenants
"When a home owner decides to make changes to the property, internally or externally, notice should be given and reduction in rent be possible for the massive inconvenience "
"Agencies should have more authority to approve maintenance requests without owner permission first.
"
Improve Rental Agencies and Property Managers job skills and ethics.
More accessible and effective mediation of tenant / property manager disputes.
Longer rental contracts
"Longer leases - many years.  Owners and Body Corporates to uphold their responsibilities with repairs and maintenance.  Standards of acceptability. 
Eg where I live at moment the high pitched squeal of  garage doors are considered noise pollution by local BCC however the body corporate has loop holes to avoid fixing this.  So as a result every morning many tenants are awoken early by high pitched squealing.  Sometimes 2.30 am,  regularly from 5 am onwards.  Who can sleep???"
Renters should be entitled to representation and participation in Body Corporates in Queensland.
"Quarterly inspections - too frequent and invasive when non-negotiable times during working hours mean agents enter the property without the tenant.  Who else has strangers entering their homes at random?  Inspections primarily only benefit agents, cost the property owner for no outcomes.  The same maintenance issues remain unattended for years with the tenant being blamed by agents to owners, and owners being blamed by agents to the tenants."
All Agents need more training in their fields of spy property management.  
improve powers for owners to recoup cost of damage to property caused by tenants/ unpaid rent
The rules around putting a rental house on the market.
"I'm a landlord. I make sure that the property is well maintained and any issues are dealt with immediately I become aware of them but I have been let down by tenants (eg) badly maintained outdoor especially pool, broken items (eg) taps, shower screens, stove ruined in under 3 years, vermin and fleas in the house, carpets ruined, big dogs that kill the neighbours pets etc. A lot of these things are discovered post bond inspection after the tenant has received their bond back. I'd like more accountability for tenants treatment of the property and living in harmony with the neighbours."
Change utility costs (water etc) to be billed directly to the tenant rather than the landlord passing it on through the agent.
Taking the control back from the owner and allowing the property manager have control to a certain degree. Asking owners certain things can take weeks to get a response and once they have you in a contract they decline anything you ask.
Property managers liaising with the tenant over entry to the property for things that the tenant has not asked for eg valuation inspections and trades coming to quote on works not requested by the tenant
Inspections and realestate expectations 
As Landlords our leasing to tenants has been pretty good with a few disastrous exceptions. 
The bond cleaning process.
Better communication with real estate. Flexibility in how you can pay your rent and with no other chargers involved in doing so. 
Increase the responsibility for tenants to look after the basic maintenance of the property
"Same standard for tenant and landlord for end of lease.  Tenant can provide short notice to end a lease, even break a lease."
"The renter really has no rights. I was in  house without working smoke alarms, carpet moth, a dishwashing that didnt auto shut off the drying element, leaking ceiling and mould and blocked drains and yet I still had to pay my rent on time and my only recourse was to contact the agent and ask for it to be fixed and or pursue the matter with the ombudsman while still having to pay rent?"
Real estate agents making rules more transparent. There seems to be so many rules and regulations that need to be followed but they do not tell you where they are or how to find them. Nothing is clear and it seems that they make up a lot of rules to suit their own purpose.
"Better maintained and stability to stay where we rent. Having to move every year or is costly, stressful and does not create stability for our children. "
More pet friendly. Limits on how long a rental property can be on the market and how many open homes can be conducted. Inspections should be 6 monthly after the first 2 if there are no concerns at the first 2. Rent increase should be limited.
Greater ability to have faults fixed quickly without threat of losing tenancy
"Every rule and law for leasing is geared towards making it easy for the tenant and hard for the landlord.

We had months of no rent and tenants wouldn't leave. We could do NOTHING, can't throw them out, can get the police to kick them out. Takes months to go through court to have them out. They lived there for months and didn't pay a dime! How is that FAIR."
"More owners allowing small pets.
Cost, even though I am in the NRAS system and splitting the rent with my adult daughter. I am paying exactly half of my centrelink payment on housing."
"Pet friendly, minimum 12 month lease so rent is not increased every year"
Offer long term leases of 5 or more years
Longer rental terms
Having to pay a mandatory extra fortnightly fee to use amenities that I do not require
if i could get a better return as the rental returns are very poor.
fairer standards for allowing tenants to make basic changes to the property - e.g. picture hooks etc.
"I have an autistic child whom loves jumping off balconies. There is sharp points on the fence below us and if he falls would be killed. I have asked to be moved to a place with a yard that is on the ground to help me but housing keep telling me that ""its not enough to move me"". What is it going to take to get them to urgently move me. I cant get a carer in as they wont issue me with a 3 bedroom. I am a single mother struggling mentally with his high needs. "
I’d like to see that no landlord can evict someone without a reason.
"The terrible mindset of the large majority of Real Estate Agents who treat renters like they're sub-standard citizens or some form of loser! Many complex managers are just as bad in this mindset. Only when I rented top-end houses was I treated appropriately. Real Estate Agents and Managers have gotten away with bad treatment of tenants for far too many years, even when we're excellent tenant, many Real Estate Agents and Managers still treat you terribly. They should be held accountable for mistreatment of people, it's very stressful for tenants."
cheaper and decent newer units.
Twice yearly inspections instead of quarterly so home isn't being entered into by strangers so often.
Tranperancy when dealing with realestates and knowing your rights ect
"Accountability for landlords to properly maintain their property rather than 'band-aid' solutions. For example, my first experience with a leaking roof was met with a landlord that thought it was OK to just put a bucket in the ceiling cavity. It was at least four years and many attempts at siliconing tiles before the roof was fixed properly. I'm now left with a huge water stain on the ceiling with a black mould patch. This is just one example."
I think there should be spot checks on the condition and tidiness of a property rather than the inspections where they have time to clean up prior to inspection.
Being able to have a pet on any property.
"I'm a landlord and renting a home is not a charity. If I personally don't pay my home loan on time the bank will fine me. If I don't pay my electricity bill on time I get fined by Ergon. If I don't pay my rates on time I get fined by Council. If I dont pay taxes on Time the ATO will fine me....

I think that if tenants don't pay rent on time then they should get get fined. It make things fair and will make tenants accountable and the might pay their rent on time. 

"
More consistency in services provided by real estate agent.
More control to be given by the Property manager. 
"Attitude of Realestate agents. We are not of subnormal intelligence or are of less importance than agents. 
Dealing with owners has been a v positive exp this time. Have had to deal with owners before,they had no idea of tenants rights."
Longer leases as standard option
Make the leases to 50 years
"Lower rent, more freedom, less or non invasive inspections, longer more secure contracts"
"The home is not your home. Too many inspections, too little rights. "
"regulation on the property management , improve the level of professionalism of the property management "
Owners/ Real Estate Agents to be able to have quicker control over rent arrears.
Penalties for property managers who refuse to respond to their tennants' concerns. 
"There are many but if I could choose one that would be end fixed term leases. People have events that occur in their lives and if they are in a fixed term lease trying to end that and move away for what ever reason is near on impossible, and down right expensive."
"Equality. Owners look at tenants as ""lesser"" than themselves, due to tenants not having the money to own a home. Due to this, they feel justified to let tenants live in conditions that they (the owners/landlord) would not deem acceptable in their own homes. Tenants feel that they have to ""shut up and be grateful"" for the ""privilege"" of paying to have a roof over their heads - even if it is leaking, mould ridden, infested, or what-have-you."
Owners being held accountable for ongoing maintenance issues
Cleaning requirement for professional bond cleaning so that all is properly cleaned for next tenants
Make rental houses confirm to minimal housing standards.  I rent house and 10 acres - I have only been able to use 0-1.5 acres.  I have never been able to unpack - wetness floors and walls - previous tenant fell through the floor. Noone can say if I am safe to walk around in this house - got building inspector - subfloor wet foundation wet right through white and green mould. Roof leak black mould through ceiling and eaves. Add on verandah roof looks to be near collapsing upon the verandah and loaded with black mould in insulation.  Beyond Property Management Pty Ltd is the agent who is more interested in sending one day rental arrears notices on the day the rent is due and paid because it does its receipting in the morning and my electronically paid rent may appear after the receipting event. It thought the leaking septic was on the roof and sent a tradesman with bathroom sealant to seal the eaves leaks unsuccessfully.  I lost $8000 worth of my possessions which were ruined by wetness and black mould from the leaking roof. No one told me about the leak.  Possessions stored on verandah because of soft cracking floors inside an otherwise pretty house.
Require more than 4 weeks rent as a deposit for a tenancy.
Having an investment property in Townsville has not been a financial success but not majorly painfull either. Policies to improve property values would be nice. property values have decreased in the last few years and maybe we made a mistake entering the property market in Queensland.
Have the option to pay for services such as water in exchange for lower rent.
Being able to make the house my home without needing permission from the landlord
Make rental agents more accountable for their actions & legal action more affordable for tenants
"Installation of solar panel panels or permission for tenants to do so. In addition, appropriate area for worm farm, composting etc. "
No long term rentals even if you are a good tentant.  Owner always renovates then sell.
Stop landlords from being rated at a higher fee than principle place of residence
I would make it easier for pet owners like myself to rent a broader variety of properties rather than the slim percentage generally available. 
Deal directly with owner. Eliminate property managers. They add delay and cost and remove sense of personal responsibility for the relationship for tenant and owner. 
Not enough choices for low or fixed income 
Property MUST be clean prior to moving in. Penalties to both vacating Tenants and Property Managers who falsely claim on Condition Report that things are clean and working when they clearly are not. Twice this had happened to us now. 
Landlord not addressing an ongoing complaint.
The ability to alter (in liaison with the landlord) properties to help meet disability needs.
No barking dogs in rental properties. Especially high rise. 
"As a landlady I’d like rental agents to work in my interests, not the tenants, as I was the one paying them. Fittings were allowed to be changed by the tenant without my permission then I was expected to pay. As a renter I found inspections were intrusive, especially when the agent whipped out his phone & darted taking photos of my furnishings & belongings, stating it was for the owner."
"Property agents must actually do inspections at regular intervals as notified; properties must have reasonable repairs (affecting water, safety and security) done within a reasonable timeframe; managers must ensure properties clean at the end of tenancy so in good condition for next tenant; workers on the property must give appropriate notice of their visit even if the landlord and stay within the notified timeframe. "
Employee incentive in agencies. 
tenants who damage property should be made to pay.  existing actions cannot even stop these criminals doing more damage.
Mandatory timeframe for completing maintenance
More properties that let you have pets.
Pet ownership is not an obstruction to renting a property
Open house time slots need to be longer
"Have knowledge that my agent is doing a good job, when I can't really see what they are doing and how they treat my tenants."
"'- Breaches can be issued as warnings, however more than one breach for the same thing after the 7 days notice doesn't seem to go anywhere and is considered another breach
- Property Managers don't have any interest in supporting the tenants and don't follow through with their promises
- Emergency repairs aren't carried out in time
- The RTA is poorly managed and sometimes creates more trouble than good due to delays in processing and process loopholes creating more stress for tenants
-Unfairness in pet ownership and renting (ie, you can't have a cat, but we'll accept a dog)"
lower rental costs
Landlords are unable to reject someone due to them having pets! 
On two occasions we have been evicted without grounds. Knowing that this can't happen would make it easier to sleep at night.
Less strangers going through home. 
I am an owner and have tenants so this question is not for me.
Owners be responsible and do the right thing buy the tenant. The rent stops going up too.  
"'- Less house inspections for those who are long term renters, especially when there hasn't been any problems raised with the tenant - eg: behind in rent, property damage, lack of basic maintenance (lawns, gardens. general tidiness) etc.
- pets - why is it so hard to find places that will allow pets and why do they have to be so expensive, just because you have a pet
- solar - make it an advantage to landlords to install solar on their properties, then everyone, especially the tenant can benefit from the advantages of solar."
landlords not being able to walk into my house while I am in bed. 
"There should be non-negotiable time limits on fixing certain household items provided as part of a tenancy (i.e. Fridge, washing machine, dryer etc).

If a property management company breaches this timeline regardless of the reason the tenant should automatically have a proportion of their weekly rent refunded until the issue is fixed. This should not be open to appeal. Half should come from the property owner & half from the property management company.

This would stop dishonest property managers & owners from offering tenancies based on providing these items then failing to fix them, leaving the tenant without use of items they are paying for.

This would also then help tenants that need to pay for hire of a fridge or laundromat fees to wash/dry clothing until the issue is fixed.

This would provide a fairer system than having to go through lengthy mediation & compensate tenants for their time and expense, & also provide an incentive for owners & property managers to behave ethically."
Particular real estate agents inability to handle tenancy and self-interest.
Entry condition report accurately completed 
Make people accept responsibility for their actions.
Solar power to help alleviate electricity bills (something that renters do not have the priviledge of having)
"1. Flexibility to have a more comfortable environment in our house instead of feeling like we will get breached for the littlest of things such as adding minor fixtures or ability to make our house into a home (with all due respect to not causing drastic damages or changes to the property).

2. Property Managers respecting our privacy and being more understandable should some circumstances change."
"Owner and property manager (owner's sister/sister-in-law) behaving appropriately, with lease that didn't include clauses contrary to the Act!  Property repairs conducted in timely fashion.  Although our dog is approved on the lease - he is not allowed so many places, in and out of the house that he's not really approved at all."
"The process for exiting a tenancy. Things like standard of cleaning required, finalising service charges, flexibility on exit date, new tenancy inspection rules. All seem very subjective and not consistent."
Owner could do more maintenance and in a timely manner. 
Not being able to deny pets
I rent out houses to other people. I would like to remove people on short notice if they do not pay rent.
Opportunity of meeting landlord instead of using agent.
"I have felt with previous renting experiences that some landlords and real estate agents forget that the place I am renting is also my home. Neglect of property, multiple inspections, unjuststfied rental increases - these are situations that impacted on my and made me feel like a second rate citizen. "
"Owners should suffer penalty if maintenance and repairs are not carried out. Currently they can not complete repairs. Even if a tenant breaches them, the worst that happens to the landlord is that the tenant can break the lease, leaving the tenant homeless and letting the landlord get off Scott free. "
Feeling more secure and stable in renting and not affraid of having the rent put up by large amounts or being asked to leave for no reason. 
The rentals are very expensive and there are not too many which allow pets. 
Rental agents are unreasonably harsh on tenants at the end of a lease
The rent is too high for a pensioner and I don't want to live in a old peoples retirement village.  I am independent and wish to stay that way.  We need to have more help with our rent.
Landlords to repair faults within reasonable time. 
"Bond should be automatically returned to tenants 
Real estate agents must have a mandatory service level agreement of when they return written correspondence via email. "
"Tenants be allowed, within reason, to hug photos and have their pets."
Property Managers are never available to respond to urgent matters on weekends.   Also not given information about no telecommunications or internet being available at the property.
When tenants infringe body corp laws that owners or property managers have greater powers of eviction
"Being able to have more control/say about my tenants, especially when they are behind or not paying their rent."
"More notice for buyer/renter inspections as 24 hours is not adequate or fair to the current tenant. Make certain things more clear, for example what does a ""reasonable"" amount of time mean between inspections?"
"I'm an owner of a property. I am very luck to have great people who manage it. I think the costs to owners re water and council rates, plus the extreme costs of insurance could be considered. If they were less, we could , as owners, spend more money on the house. In my case, we have put in ducted air conditioning and a $2,500 shed for our tenants. "
"Timeframes around property entry
Clearer expectations for renters ahead of entering the property
Better response times for maintenance"
"More affordability,  Decreasing Inspection based on Good Behaviour, More pet friendly homes "
There's nothing I would change in renting has I'm broading at the moment
Make the rules just as fair for the home owner as it is for the tenant
The Real Estate Agents and staff are the rudest people I have ever dealt with. They are uninintelligent and full of their own importance.  The owners were very reasonable people.
Tenants need to respect the property where they live and not break regulations put in place by landlord before they signed lease.
The owner having more rights to remove renters when they damage the property or don't pay their rent.
Pets allowed without landlord permission. Caveat being that any damage done by pet has to be paid for by tenant.
Real estate agents are biased towards the owners to the point where they act illegally. I've had agents tell me that owners can't afford repairs (windows wouldn't close and lock). There should be some way to reprimand real estate agents who don't abide by the laws.
More control over the agencies. They can be pretty rude while using their power. They should stop treating tenants as criminals.
NO changes. If you look after the property owners will look after you.
"As a Landlord, I feel quite powerless when I have a bad tenant, who either won't pay rent/is behind on rental, or does damage to the place.  I feel the laws are skewed in favour of bad tenants and they take advantage of that.  "
"The ability to have pets automatically, less inspections and more security of tenency ."
wishing that the Housing Commission list is not tooo long
Have long term rental option
Standard of Property Management.
"3 monthly inspections are an invasion of privacy.  6-12monthly inspections would be sufficient.  Also every tenant should have a right to have their pet reside with them.  Also if you want to put pictures up you can but,  just use appropriate hooks that won't damage walls.  If they do damage then as a tenant you are responsible for all repairs when vacating the property."
"Rents must match incomes. I have suffered chemical poisoning in the workplace at 53yrs old which was diminished by workcover to an allergic reaction. Over and above illness, I am already stretched to the limit fighting for justice in court with no effective medical attention. On top of this, I am left to survive on $275- pw centrelink income for 3.5yrs which renders me unable to even afford to rent a room in a share house. I have slept in my car, overstayed invitations in elderly friends houses for up to six months etc. Now finally have public housing but had to eat via the Salvo’s for months as this occured when saving for rego. Court case will go to trial early next year.  All good to have legislation but if you aren’t clear on the extremely cruel effects this can have on an individual, you are not doing your job"
"The real estate agent's expectations in terms of cleanliness when vacating a property are completely unreasonable and abusive. I feel that I have been used as free labour by agents who had the power the stop the release of my bond back to me, although I have a much appreciated tenant during my tenancy and I returned the property extremely clean and neat. I have never had this experience when I was renting in Victoria. 
Also during tenancy, having an inspection by the real estate agent every 3 months is excessive, and I don't appreciate having pictures of my belongings taken and sent to the owner. I feel that this is an invasion of my privacy, and that I had no choice but to agree to it if I wanted to rent a property. "
Make all rental properties allow pets (within reason). 
Landlords only having the ability to end a lease for a detrimentally valid reason.
We had to include my brother on the application because we had just relocated from Canada (but had good references and plenty of money behind us). Surely something could be done about this - if my brother wasn't prepared to step-up then I wonder if we would have been approved for our place? I think this is somewhat unfair as other families may not have this option. 
"Impossible to rent your own place unless you are a high-income earner - means I have been share housing for 10 years, very stressful at times. "
"I am a property manager, often find owners are out of pocket"
"Making it mandatory for all repairs on a rental property to be carried out within a certain timeframe // making it illegal to rent a property that is in a certain state of disrepair (eg. Holes in the ceiling, broken windows, smelly carpets, electrical problems)"
Renters seem to have a lot of sway over property managers rather than the owners. I would like to see property managers actively working in the interests of the owner.
Shorten the time advising tenants to vacate the property from 2 months to 1 month.
Property owners need more protection
there is no need to be checked on every 3months if you are a good tenant.
Real estate interaction
"Body Corporate in townhouse and apartment complexes can bully and invade the privacy of tenants with ease. 
"
Having tenants more responsible for their pets.
I have been in 5 different rental properties during my time in QLD and can honestly say I have not had any issues during this time at any of my properties. 
"The parking is terrible. Council issue ""residents parks"" that are never available so I spend average of ten hours a week looking for parks at my own house"
checks made on premises to ensure properties are up to standard acceptable rent rates landlords made to ensure rental costs do not exceed the rate rise of pension increases
increase rent strategically from the rent company
Better rental security for long term rental agreements and eliminate fix term contracts. Have a long term rolling contract such as each party must give 3 months notice unless breach of agreement.
Less rules and regulations from the government. Should be a mutual agreement by both party as per the contract. 
"As a Australian citizen living abroad I now pay about $15,000 QLD land tax per annum. This amount means that my property is making a loss every year and there is no funds left over for improvements etc. The amount I pay in land tax is unfair compared to what I used to pay as a resident. I do not mind paying tax however it should be a realistic relative to the  income of the property. I provide value for money rent and I also employ tradesmen etc. I should not be put in a position where I am subject to large indirect costs."
owners getting repairs done quickly
"Tenants who at times do not manage the property and leave it in a horrible mess for owner to cover such cost. 
Tenants who actually can take ownership and pride in their even if they are renting. How is it possible to live in your own mess and expect someone else to pick up after self. There should be better screening for such tenants who are making many more out there look bad and in the end, everyone ends up loosing because of them"
Being able to treat the rental as a home and being tied into so many rules like we're criminals and can't be trusted to look after the property.
"Introduce a ""one stop shop"" for residential address registration. Such a service would provide a flexible tenant with a registration number, that can be provided to any institution that requires a residential address. When the flexible tenant moves, they only need to tell the service, not every institution.
"
Want to be able to treat the rental more like a home. Able to attached approved picture hangers for photos and pictures. Able to have a dog and even let it into the home especially when it is house trained and a part of the family and doesn't cause damage.
To make sure the tenants are happy paying the amount of rent expected
Stronger and enforceable guidelines for owners to have to maintain rental properties at a higher standard
More and better public housing
The legislation is very tenant biased.
"I'm Landlord - Have more education sessions on the RTA. Webinars or website for both tenants and landlords.
Have mandatory licenced requirements for cleaning, such as presenting receipts for carpets as proof that they have been done. Even having commercial cleaners to do the cleaning."
Improvement to maintenance requirements and ability to have a pet
Better maintenance reporting process. My then family of 4 had to go without hot water in winter for almost 2 weeks waiting for someone to come and look at our hot water system. Took several phone calls and emails to the real estate to get someone out. Only got someone in the end because I called the plumber directly and THEY called the real estate.
Better protection of tenants rights
The right for owners to remove tennants from thier property imediately after failure to remedy breach.
More power to the Owner to remove tenants if needed
"Ability to have pets, paint walls and hang pictures on the walls, to personalise a house more.
Having the ability to plant trees at a property. Most rental properties have zero trees in the backyard and it makes them stifling in summer."
Owner feels helpless if the tenant plays the financial constraints card and forces the owner to manage costs of repair to the damage done by the tenant 
"More security of tenure: longer leases, standard terms. "
" being a European/Australian I have rented in France and Switzerland. I need to share the fact that feeling at home in Brisbane QLD property is limited. Real Estate coming to visit the property every 6 months is invasive. The fact that the real estate has entered my property without my authority was also not acceptable. The fact that repairers are not trained enough on the RTA laws is concerning. I have had situation where i found A tree lopper company who had jumped the fence and told me they had the right to do so.. NO!!!!!!!
I believe the real estate should be more accountable about their chosen tradies, with proof and documentation regarding training on the tenant's rights."
"Longer terms for lease agreements
"
"More pet friendly options are needed. Inspections three monthly is ridiculous. No option to fit solar power. rents are often obscene, limiting my choices severely."
Long term lease options of two or three years. I have moved twenty two times in 18 years.
"That a prospective tennant accepts the condition of the property as offered. We experienced a tennant moving in and then the requests started coming in for improvements and specifically tree lopping
We cooperated with the majority of requests to maintain a good relationship but renters negotiate a lower rent then want improvements done. If the improvements were done prior to renting then the asking price would be higher.
No problems with safety issues that arise post rental but basically any issues should be discussed prior to signing the agreement"
I would like to improve how renters are treated.  At the moment tenants are not treated very well.  I do not like that our real estate agents can take photos inside the house every inspection as I feel it is a breach of our privacy.  
The things I would change is by putting ceiling fans in units or aircons because in summer it gets really hot and when there is no breeze it makes it hard or even by putting insulation in the ceiling might help.
Open communication between parties. I think a lot is lost in notes and sms.
"I would monitor Real Estates activities. Real Estates are a law unto themselves and there is no organisation that monitors their activities. They are ripping both the tenant and the home owners. They set the rental prices which is way over the top for the crappy rentals, they also tell home owners lies about costings for repairs. I have never heard of a roof costing $40,000 to replace. Playing tenants and home owners against each other."
Pets to be considered an integral part of a family.
"Longer leases with
More freedom to make minor changes 
"
More clear guidelines for when vacating a property 
The process of having your bond refunded has become harder over the period of time that I have been renting which has been for 20+ years. Compensation for normal wear and tear is sought more readily and if mediation is sought then it is difficult to 'win' any ground because it is a sole tenant versus a whole real estate company.
"If there is a governmental platform where tenant can rate the agent/landlord/onsite manager, it will be very helpful when choosing a rental property. Or tally on the issues RTA dealt with so tenant can be aware of them before renting."
"Entry and Exit report treatment.
Agents can't see when they prepare entry reports and wear magnifying glasses when completing exit reports.
Agents lack integrity and act fraudulently when blaming tenants for damage that was recorded on their entry reports."
Force owners of rental properties to deal with their tenants
"Stop the practice of landlords asking tenants to confirm renewal of leases 3 months or even more out from the lease being up or they will give 2 months notice to leave. It gives too much power to landlords as tenants are forced to either renew or face the HUGELY stressful task of trying to find a suitable and affordable property with a fixed date to vacate the property. You end up in a situation where most houses aren't advertised until a month or so out and then you have to take what is available or risk being not only homeless but also having a house full of belongings that need to removed and put where exactly? It's ridiculous and must surely be contributing to the stupid increases in rent that are occurring in some areas.

"
Having an independent inspection process.  Someone external to undertake rental inspections.
have had tenants for 15 years and it is only in the past 3 years we have had a good experience
"There is no enforcing body for tenats to protect. The law is there but action against unlawfull behavior is given. Breaches, conflict resolution and qcat  do only work if both parties play by the rules."
"Ending a lease. 
60 days notice for extending lease is too long. Should be no more than 6 weeks and 3 weeks for tenant to agent. "
Longer time between property inspections is needed. It can be extremely stressful having young children and having to worry about having a spotless house/yard
To allow small pets 
The price of rent to be lower (allowing for saving for the possibility of home ownership one day)
"Landlord to give notice in writing & verbally before entering the property & can only enter if I'm home.
 Unless of course I've ignored all correspondence on 3 or more occasions. Then they should be allowed to call upon the police to make a welfare check with forceful entry if required. Inspection / eviction could then be carried out."
the rent is far more expensive than it should be. 
Give landlords more rights to the property they legally own and should be able to say how it is maintained.
"Allow pets to be owned at rental properties.

"
"Having to undergo 3mthly inspections whereby I am given instructions such as ensuring my ceiling fans are dusted etc the list fills an A4 sheet. I feel like I’m treated like a child, I work full time & have a full time housekeeper. And the issue of not being able to have a pet - a bird or goldfish is also considered a pet. And I had to pay for treatment of garden hedges which were infected with mites - I feel this should not be my responsibility. And I was breached for not mowing a lawn which is smaller than my bedroom because at that time it had rained for weeks & ground was soaked."
Laws about other tenants smoking on their balconies and common spaces
More understanding real estates and a decrease in rent prices
"Protect the rights of owners in deciding when to issue notices to get renters to leave if they aren’t paying rent, damaging property and getting a new tenant in asap. Protecting property owners ability to decide if they want to allow a pet in the property or not. It’s the owners property after all so as long as the owner can have a final say provided it doesn’t infringe on renter basic human rights and within reason then I will continue to be satisfied with the renting experience in QLD."
"Rental Agencies not complying with their legal requirements, e.g. Entry Notices, and Tenants' complaints are brushed off. Seems like they are only there for the Owners."
Real state needs to give the new leaser a complete documented entry report!
Quicker response from agents in relation to matters raised regarding damage to rental property 
"Property owners can't say no to allowing tenants to have pets, unless the pet has a proven to be destructive, aggressive etc. Like have a blacklist system, like with people."
"Only that I wish it was a lifetime tenancy rather than three years, as a pensioner I would feel much more secure but otherwise my tenancy is wonderful thank you."
"Having pets, being able to paint or hang things on the walls, speeding up the repair process, mold being blamed on tennant is also wrong"
Cleaning better upon end of tenancy
Real Estate Agents & Property Managers forced to be more 'accountable' for their behaviour & attitude.
Property Managers to be more active and responsible for any maintence that has to be done. Unfortunatly we don't have that with who we rent through 
"Making the tenants more accountable for WEAR N TEAR as I firmly believe that the fair Wear n Tear business firmly favours the tenant

We have had the experience of owning approx. 11 properties and some of the decisions on Wear N Tear are to say the least very dubious"
"maybe incorporating utilities into the rental price, so water and possibly solar can be part of the rent"
Stronger compliance arrangements for agents
Lighten some of the restrictions on landlords
More rights to tenants to allow the property to feel like a home. Eg. hanging pictures on the wall. Allowing tentants to have input on when tradies enter the premise (within a reasonable time frame) and when inspections for new tenants occur. 
Making pets allowed indoors 
That agencies are able to attend to minor  maintenance without first seeking approval from owners 
"Queensland housing do something about there loud fowl mouth tenants. All we hear all day is fuck off cunt, fuck off cock sucker, you fucking cunt and on and on shouted all day every day this how Mum and kids talk to each other. I make complaints and nothing gets resolved. It just gets worse cause then the tenants abuse you for complaining. "
There needs to be a body who makes real estate accountable for failures. Many real estate ignore urgent repairs. The RTA is of no help in forcing these real estates to take action. Agents who ignore requests for maintenance should be fined for each incidence. Landlords who refuse to allow any repairs should be listed on a tica style database so they cannot re rent the property without first making it liveable
Make it tougher on tenants who don't pay rent then leave your house damaged and the bond doesn't cover it!
People complain that their landlords are difficult to deal with.  On the whole this probably relates more to landlords who manage properties themselves and do not use a registered real estate agent.  Tenants expect they should be able to do as they please but there has to be some give and take on both the tenant and owners side.  Tenants think they can put up pictures wherever with out getting permission.  They don't maintain gardens and lawns and some place look an eyesore - this is something which agents don't address unless the owner persists.
Property owners carry risk that is inadequately protected with bonds that are too small. Tenants don't care if they lose it.
More pet friendly properties 
much landlords accountable to fix problems in units and reduce their ability to punish tenants for seeking valid repairs and maintenance
"Lower commission from the Real Estate Agent managing my property. I don't feel that the Real Estate does very much at all for me, but I have them for security, in the hope that if there are ever any problems, the real estate agent will take care of things for me."
Better communication from real estates 
Frequency of inspections. Not every 3 months. 
"more freedom to make rental properties a home, being able to have longer leases, hang pictures on the walls, have pets, lanscape the garden, have chickens, renovate... not having this huge bond, and it hanging over our heads that we may lose it if we do one tiny thing like scratch the wall or something 

also rent shouldn't go up every 6 months "
Freedoms of the tenant restricted by landlords in leases such as pet access and hanging things on walls
Improve maintenance times; reduce frequency of inspections.
Less market power for landlords.
I think after paying rent for years the owner can't have a brand new house and the real estate trying always to keep the bond.
"1. While I acknowledge that rental agents are the agent of the owner, the rental agent should work with the tenant to resolve issues and this does not often happen.  2. Although we are dissatisfied by the poor response by the rental agents to legitimate issues, we often do not exercise our rights.  To exercise our rights, we would have to issue a breach notice which if not resolved could resolve in the lease being terminated and us  having to move.  There is also fear of reprisal and at worst, being blacklisted in renter databases. 3. There is a lack of good faith by owners - the lease terms state reasonable wear and tear however my experience is that the owner, through agent, requires the property to be returned at the same if not better condition. 4. There is often a discrepancy between what the legislation states and what is asserted by the owner and their rental agent."
"QCAT enforcing the law and rules, not watering decisions down to suit tenants. Black and White, not guess what happens this time i go in."
How real estate agents treat the tenant
Remember that some landlords have spent 30 years paying off their rental property.
"Basic requirement check pre moving in as a tenant, e.g.plumbing, cleaning. Mandated pest control"
I would like it if the rental inspections were cut back to twice a year after a tenant has been residing in a property for a specified amount of time and proven that they are responsible.
Rules regarding pets
Longer contract terms
Be allowed to put up picture hooks ( just a few) without needing permission.
"Not able to trust it could be a longer term home, "
Being disabled I cannot get the benefits of assistance because the body corp where I rent refuses to allow the fitting of hand rails in the bath and shower and security catch on the door
Entry rights of agents
I think all Tenants should be allowed to have dogs The lack of availability of properties for people on centrelink. The requirement to have to pay bonds.
"Better protection for the privacy, property and security of current tenants with respect to entry by lessors, agents, tradesmen, and prospective buyers/tenants. 

Entry for periodic inspections should require a *written response* (i.e. written approval) from the tenant - providing confirmation that a) the tenant has actually sighted the notice, and b) the date and time is suitable. The date and time should always be reasonably open for negotiation.

Owners and agents should not be able to conduct open house inspections by the general public until a property is vacated by the outgoing tenant (unless the current tenant is okay with it and provides written consent). Why should an investor's greed and presumed entitlement to unbroken rental income take precedence over a tenant's right to privacy and the integrity/security of their home and possessions?"
I'm an owner - We would like to get better quality tenants instead of tenants not paying rent on time. 
"better landlord rights for defaulting tenants, or tenants that commit criminal damage or refuse to leave."
I believe that there needs to be a quasi governmental authority that audits the quality and maintenance of rental properties on an annual basis.  This would provide an independent voice for both tenant and landlord. The authority should identify what works need to be undertaken by landlords and what damage tenants are responsible for.  
Owners can't change their mind on pets if it's not already in the lease. 
There should be a leeway for those people whose income decrease significantly in the private rental market so you can stay where you are living for a longer period of time instead of landlords wanting you to move out as you can no longer afford the full rent
"owner of house having money to carry out repairs on there house
basic maintenance no carried out here 
aircon  to small in one room and two rooms missing aircon pads this was reported many times and aircon people looked at it with no result.
no pool manual pool equipment and auto filter not working 
realestate do more to assist in fitting problems
i carried out a lot of maintenance on house and cost me tie and money no returns for me"
Have better response to issues with the property from real estate
Standardised inspection reports
Tenants to be more accountable when repair cost for damage they have caused is in excess of the bond.
"Faster repairs, some items still not fixed 12 months later, these repairs would cost next to nothing to fix yet would enhance the properties appearance. I have been requested not to do some repairs such as paint touch ups."
"longer lease terms, say 2-5 years"
Make owners and property managers more accountable by having set timelines for enquiries or problems & maintenance
Freeing the information that can be relayed back to the tenants as at the moment a lot of tenants are left in the dark about a lot of things 
"Property inspections. Letting agents making appointments to inspect , and not showing up!
Inspections should be limited to property damage only. "
"Renters need to be more valued. I feel like I have never been valued as a tenant. The process behind the bond payments need to be changed as well. I struggle to save up for a huge bond whilst still paying rent, other bills, food, school etc. And then to wait almost a month to get the previous bond back. This process needs to be made easier pretty please. "
Transfering your bond from one property to the next.
"Uncontrolled yearly rent increases, without being informed, at the time I signed the lease, how much yearly increases were going to be."
Ensure that the rental property manager have a duty of care to ensure that tenants move into a clean and tidy property. Not just promise it will get cleaned - and never does.
"Standards in how clean a property has to be when vacated.
No fixed lease terms."
Allowing pets and longer leases.
Communication from tenant to real estate agent to the owner.
"General Maintenance laws for example: every 5 years house interior needs repainting, every 10 years carpets need replacing and general Maintenance carried out at regular intervals. Also for those who are good tenants and have a good reputation, have inspections less often."
"We have recently moved our rental property management over to a larger real estate agency, part of the reason for this change was the systems they had in place to manage our property effectively, help identify anything that needed to be fixed and ensure the interest of the property owner and tenant were considered.  Monitoring the organisations responsible for property management should also be an important aspect of the renting reform initiative. "
"A quick way/ rating to distinguish between great, average and not so great tenants."
"The legislation is too vague. I have been a property manager for 8 years now and the amount of conflict that the overuse of the word ""reasonable"" creates is insane. As a tenant it also causes a lot of uncertainty. 
e.g a reasonable amount of time must have passed since the last tenant inspection & urgent repairs must be completed in a reasonable amount of time. Some tenants will breach us after an hour of a sewerage leak, whilst as a tenant our property manager may argue its not unreasonable for the repairs to go on for a couple of weeks. In WA their legislation actually gives timeframes for urgent repairs which are quite reasonable. 
"
Less pressuring from rental agencies. Whilst renting it felt like they had all the power and we weren't sure of what our rights were or what we were entitled to and whenever we brought up something to them we received a very negative reply or no reply at all. 
Longer lease terms
equal notice periods for both sides
tenants to take more responsibility and an equal approach to landlord rights and tenants rights
Being able to treat the rental property more as a home than a shrine for the owner. 
"For people who long term rent the amount of house inspections you must go through.  I have rented the same place for 5 years and its still every 3 months.
More rights for pets, I don't have children and my pets are my children and its an issue to find a rental which will take pets"
More transparency from real estate agents. You can do everything right as a tenant but can have the house sold out from under you and with two weeks notice to find another house is not long enough.
Landlords and real estate agents should not be able to increase the rent without first giving a reason. My rent has been increased and when I asked why I was told it was at the request of the landlord now I know where I live land values have fallen and I can see no justification for the rental increase when I do all the maintenance on the property myself.
Every real estate agent  puts their own interpretation onto the rules and does something different. Renting in QLD is only for the benefit of the home owner not the renter
"If somebody as been renting for over 1 year in the same dwelling, and has shown to be a good tenant, then inspection of property could be once every 6 months instead of monthly."
"I would change that unless the owner is under financial hardship, they cannot sell their investment property when a tenant is living in it unless the tenant agrees to it. "
All rental repair should be done asap
"The terms of bond refunds, renting with pets. "
Ability to have long term leases and make minor modifications to the property without asking permission. 
Prices are too expensive for what you get and the size of the property
That property owner can be contacted by tenant if issues arise with property rental agent/s.
Ban agents from taking photos of home and contents unless there’s damage
"When there are concerns with repairs or having the standard of living advertised originally, there should be an easier way to manage these"
The property managers are very average. I believe there should be snap checks on property managers and six monthly inspections should be signed of by tenant. In my case I put sticky tape on doors the day the inspection was to happen no sticky tape broken which means lying to owner.
Stricter advertising laws
affordable rent for pensioners allowing access to housing that reflects reasonable living standards to support a comfortable lifestyle for retirees living on the pension only.
"Less paperwork.
How about a database for good renters, with a different level system, e.g pay your rent in advance consistently for a set period and get a great rating."
"Once a tenant has rented a property for more than 12mths, without actions raised by Property Manager, the inspections should be decreased from 3mths to 6mths.  3mthly is an invasion of privacy, with many property managers expecting the house to be unlived in.  This should be an inspection of damage and general cleanliness rather than an unlived in inspection house."
can charge tenants of their water usage - under current rules it does not allow to charge tenants' water usage if the period was more than 6 months ago.  The water bills came late (one year after building completion) and I could not charge the tenants of their water usage although they have occupied the premise during the billing period.
Lessen notice periods that agents give tenants
"The agencies insist that rent/ invoices are paid by PayWay/ deft, this incurs a charge ever time it’s used, which is weekly for rent. They should incur this charge."
"That a rental must be maintained at the same level of when you first entered the property. Plus, there should be more properties to rent with pets such as cats and dogs which are part of most families."
Better support from the RTA regarding inquiries about how rent is calculated.
"Expense, the whole process, poor communication, bond release/transfer, first time renters- very difficult to get on renting ladder"
"More freedom to live, our owners constantly deny us basic rights and treats us like we have just moved in. I currently have lived in my home 6 years and i asked can i put a dishwasher in (got told no even though the space and power point are there little had to be done), asked to have a second outside do (flat out no), asked to replace the broken and missing verticals with drapes and curtains out of my own expense (no again even though people can see in we are allowed to do nothing), back fence is falling down gets quote does nothing. stove top broken does nothing, but if i'm one day late i'm in trouble."
Water usage charges to be paid by user/tenant
Longer times between inspections
Renters should have the right to have pets in their homes so long as the animal is suitable to the size of the property.
More power to the property owners.
Better communication between Landlord and tenant and also better clarify of Tenants rights and landlords rights 
"Less invasion of private space with periodic inspections - increase these to 6 monthly or more
"
That you should be innocent unless proven guilty. Not guilty until proven innocent. Real estate agenst should be allowed to get away with treated tenants like dirt.
"Lower prices, and real estate agencies to have less power to mess tenants around by charging large fee to change people on leases and being overly strict with getting bonds back "
Lower rental price and more places to pick from 
"Not having to take ongoing maintenance cases through QCAT to Win and be allowed to break our lease or offered two weeks free rent, because the Owner / Estate Agent refused to do the requested Maintenance.       "
Mandatory time frame for both minor and major repairs.. We pay rent we should have repairs done in a timely fashion. 
 The government public housing needs to take ones disability into consideration and the private rentals need to do work on the house I could send so photos that would turn your heads 
To be able to have inspections every 6mths instead of every 3mths.
Security should be mandatory on ALL windows and doors
"I think there should be some kind of anonymous property review website so that prospective tenants can find out about problems at a property (e.g. noisy or aggressive neighbors, pest animals, etc.) that often aren't noticeable during a brief inspection. Real estate agents would not be allowed to penalize previous tenants for recording these issues on the website."
Requests for maintenance need to be better acted on.  There should be a deadline owners need to obey.
"Less inspections, 3 monthly inspections is ridiculous for 12 month leases and long term tenants should get maximum of 1 inspection per year (example: going on to a second year of a 12 month lease). Maybe if a breach notice has been issued re: condition/maintenance of the property to tenants then you could increase to bi-annually or quarterly for more serious or repeated breaches. "
"Making it illegal to even ask if someone has a pet or children on an application along with rejecting them due to this. 

Making owners more liable for their rental properties faults and having a rule and time limit to fix things.

The rental bond people should be doing the checks on the house to assure bond is refunded appropriately not the owner or the realestate. "
How real estate agents and landlord do not need a reference from old tenants and only tenants do so we don’t know what we are getting into before we rent. Then you are at the mercy of the lease at the will of complete power trippers. Very much one sided
"Less Frequent inspections for long term tenants.. if you have been in the same property for years without an issue, 3 monthly inspections are uneccessary."
"As a landlord I find that tenants come in full of promises to keep premises as their own, but we need to know how they live.  They claim to be gardeners etc that would love to look after the place, but when it comes time to check the place over there is evidence that they are incapable or unwilling to look after house or garden.  It is so difficult to get compensation for the destruction of property.  Some seem very professional at duping magistrates etc, and acting the victim, but in truth they spoil it for good tenants.  I find I am hardening as the years go by."
Nothing special.But I like to live in the good environment as human being.
More rights to the tenants. Feels like the balance is on the owners at times. Feel victimised by neighbours being a tenant . Neighbours feel they have the right to victimise tenants and you feel helpless to complain. And who do you complain to?
"More public housing availability. Not just for people on social security benefits, but for those of us who are on a low income.  To be able to access NRAS easier, too. "
Property management fees (market rates) seem to be higher than in other states.
"I am a fair person, but unfortunately tenants have far more rights than landlords and makes a property managers job very difficult."
The power that real estate agents have to deduct money from your bond.
"If it was better known through tenants what their rights are
"
"Tenancy agreements - much more open and flexible. Needs to be more fair. 
No lock in leases, or increased rent for not extending a lease long term. 
The fees are really high for both parties (eg new lease or break lease) yet the agency is collecting their admin fees and % of rent which should more than cover the small amount of effort they put in. 
"
"Repairs not being done on time, over a year with the skylight raining in the house pool pump left broken for over three months trees so overgrown it’s like living in a cave"
Landlords should install solar panels so we can pay lower utility bills.?
Being able to use the house in total: using the walls to hang things up rather than using the holes which were left by the owners who renting the place out. Being able to colour the walls without permission as long as you undo it when you leave the house (if the owner is not satisfied with the colour).
That repairs are done by a qualified trades person and not a handyman
"Allow my pet access to indoors. She is house trained and has a knee joint problem and the best our landlord offered was that our dog could sleep in the laundry, the cold cement laundry that floods when it rains."
"Real estates that actually do their job. 
Get repairs done in a quick timely manner instead of making our requests seem like it's a Hassel. 
But also not doing anything they can to keep our bond when we have been model Tennant's and left the house in better shape then it was."
if there was fairness in paying without being breached
Cheaper decent rentals avail for pensioners.
"To have the power to get things fixed. If something is not working properly then it needs to be dealt with, not just when it stops working."
"Longer rental terms
Ability to hang things on walls with sticky hooks"
Property management could listen to the tenant more.
"Make tennants more liable for unpaid rent, cleaning and repair costs involved when exiting a property. Have on going persuit of outstanding monies when tennant reapplies for another property through the bond board, or set up a register that has to check for these tennants before approval is taken to rent another property.      "
Pet owners should not be discriminated against (just like people with kids). Previous rental history should be enough of an indicator of the kind of tenant/pet owner the person is. 
That real estate communicate with the owners properly and just keep up with maintenance.   At present we are doing well in our rental but previous one was not so good in the end when we moved out. 
Set a limit on amount of open house inspections that can be conducted by the real estate when a property is being sold. Earlier this year my real estate held twice weekly open house inspections for 6 weeks running. That is A LOT of strangers looking through my private living space. Any extremely inconvenient. 
"Repairs completed in a timely and appropriate manner. The right for basic things to work, like ovens, shower screens, septic systems."
Have a pet bond to encourage landlords to rent
"More Co-operation with private landlord.  They charged us extra for water usage, when we were looking after their property. "
Rights of the renter - permission to put photos up/ realistic expectations on bond clean/ Not having to be ridulously cautious in kids playing to prevent accidental damage/ not to feel like 2nd class to owners. Real estates work for landlords and are often very heavy handed. Repairs should be completed in acceptable timeframes and positive intent given when repairs for wear and tear occur. Fast return of bonds as they are quick to take money but very slow/bully mentality in returning money. 
"More support for rental tenants so landlords can't take bond to replace curtains that are 5+ years old and offer longer leases with rent at fixed price until lease end. Tenants should not have to pay for water in houses that have made no significant water saving renovations. Tenants should have a body they can go to to share places that ar over priced,dangerous, un-maintained  yet on the market for rent with Real Estates "
"More competent agents through rigorous training, an enforceable code of conduct, clearer guidelines on legislative issues and mandatory minimum training for all prospective, new and existing agents."
"Reduce the number of inspections

Especially where they make you feel like you need to clean the house like you are moving out asking for you bond refund. "
To not be renting we have been paying $420 per week in our current property for 3 yrs now. We have an excellent rental history and we want this money to be paying off a mortgage. Look after Australians.
"RTA being more actively involved
For example all documents be in triple 1 copy to be kept by lesser 1 copy goes to real estate/lessor/owner of property and 1 copy to RTA  as leases already do. Documents such as  property inspections,maintenance repair forms and more. Email version and hard copy version to stop any discretion by any parties concerned . E.g. owners not receiving or complying to repair request this will allow for more transparency.  "
better  customer service 
"Basic standards for any rental property.
If you rent a property it should not be able to go up for sale within one week.
If you rent a property and it is sold the owner of the property should pay for the tenant to relocate.. 4 out of the 6 places I have rented in Brisbane over the last 16 years have been sold while living there. That’s around a year living on public display and quite frankly an invasion of privacy. Bordering on the reducilous when the agent has been in your house 3 times in one week and then the following week needs to do the requied house inspection then 3 days later is back for an open inspection.
Information for available properties to rent is usualy very minimal and most have minimal photos and often they are so old and out of date you could think you are in a totally different property. Sometimes totally misleading.
You sighed a contact to rent at that price, yet the charges and fees change at will.
Now for sheer stupidity, you know the house is going to be gutted and renovated or demolished as soon as you vacate the property.Yet you still need to professionally get all carpets steamed cleaned even paint and repair standard wear and tear on the property to get your bond back."
"The tenant should be responsible for paying the full payment for water usage, this would encourage tenants to be more mindful of the amount of water they use, which is positive for the environment and town water supplies.  Payment for annual pest control should be mandatory by the tenants as this would reduce unsanitary living conditions, particularly when there are children in the family and increase the likelihood of future pest issues for future tenants in the rental property."
"My realestate knowing and obiding the laws. Not giving me grief due to my age. 
Not threatening me to play made up fees or else take them to court. 
My realestate making false accusations up. 
My realestate makes up her own rules and changes them in the same 5 minutes"
"I feel like in the last 5 years of renting the owner of the property has to less to help maintain the property and I as the renter have more responsibility.:. Eg. pest control, our house is infested with red backs and black spiders from day one of moving in when I asked if they had it sprayed before we moved in, I was told by the agent that didn’t have to and that it was up to us to do it! "
Better enforcement and support from Govt when Agents change the manner of rental payments part-way through the rental period; something which I understand is improper. 
"Change the way entry condition reports and exit condition reports are used.  
Real Estates mark everything as CLEAN, WORKING & IN GOOD ORDER on every page of the entry condition report - despite the true condition of the property.  The tenant marks their side of the entry report and finds what the real estate has marked as CLEAN ETC., is in fact not clean  or not working and the Real Estate takes either no action or action in several months to rectify. 
However, when the tenant vacates, the Real Estates becomes so pedantic and if there is a hair or fly on the ground, they will mark this as needing to be attended.  They will make claim for part of the bond for the most smallest things, in my experience, to make a little extra money.  The clean or repair (from the bond money) does not occur and the problem then becomes the next tenants issue.  The Real Estate pockets the money and the property owner is not aware of the claim.  
I believe the OWNER must be included in any bond claim sign off,  to ensure the actual bond money is used for rectification work.  "
"Bond disputes are too much of a lengthy/expensive process and rarely end in favour of tenant. Too much overlap of moving out of one place then into another (i.e. need bond upfront for new place, don’t get bond refund for old place in timeframe that you need it). Cosmetic damages to property are extortive in repair prices (e.g. real estates make you pay $400 for paint chip, etc). Real estate agents have too much power, not enough training/accountability (e.g. I don’t want a 20year old wanker in a suit barely out of high school playing around with hundreds of thousands of property owners dollars, having the power to financially ruin both tenants and property owners). "
More owners accepting pet applications and being transparent about pets being allowed or not on listings - to prevent having to await responses to enquiries and/or turning up to inspections where pets aren't accepted (i.e. wasting time at inspections). 
"There is an issue with the way lease agreement are renewed. It is landlord favour as to the following.
A RE or LL issues a renewal on a lease the tenant must have it signed and back to them before 90days of lease expiring BUT if a tenant want to move than as a tenant we have to give 30days notice. The problem is that if the tenant decides to leave then it is unfair to the tenant as it should be issue lease renewal at 90 days and then be signed and back to RE or LL 30 days before lease expires.
Also with TICA with a 1902 number that is unfair and just down right money grab there need to be a ruling for these business to have a number with the tenant is not paying outright high fees to sort out rental issues as the RE have STD number to contact them and if this keeps up it will cause tenant to become homeless or bankrupt as the cost of these call to any TICA is $5.95/min and they keep you on hold for a long time as to gain for funds. This need to be rectified very quickly. If the credit file company can be fair then tenancy agency can be to."
Allow pets and be able to hang pictures and frames in the house to make it a home
Owners should have to improve properties. There should be a mandatory time in which they have to fix issues around the house.  Rental prices are far to high. 
Being able to hang pictures on the walls and owners not being able to stipulate what size dog can live at the property.
Force real estate agents to be honest and impose penalties for lying the tenants for their own gain.
The timeliness of response to concerns/issues/repair reporting.
Increase the amount of affordable housing for people on government benifits.
"Cease automatic rent increases at lease renewal time. Rents should be based on the market at the time, not automatically increased for the sake of it."
"Reduce the reliance on owner approval for things because it can take weeks to get a response (e.g. allowing pets, fixing locks, getting a green waste bin)"
"Better accountability on contracts written by real estate agents. My last lease had a clause for a 'breaking of lease' fee for if one housemate wished to break from the lease, which we found was not legally enforceable. There were a few other cases where they tried to use a veneer of legality to enforce behaviours we were able to easily counter."
Mandatory timeframes for property fixtures.
"The process for a defaulting tenant to be forced to pay arrears is onerous.  It is weighted in favour of the tenant, and the landlord is left with large accumulated debts that take years to recover, if at all."
more regulation and audits of property managers. they are not transparent and their inaction costs money. they need to be truthful re conversations between tenant and landlords.
The landlord listening and being more prompt with repairs
"more security around lease, knowing you are able to stay long term.  more trust given to tenants who have proved they take care of property.  no three monthly check with photos of everything.  Pets within reason, we have to leave property as we found it anyway so if pets damage grass we have to replace when leaving.  "
"I would be great if they don't need to do inspections 4 times a year. It's not nice feeling regardless you are home or not at the time, some stranger come into your house (and some of them even take photos). Also I don't trust real estate agent. 
They never do inspection in Japan."
Process to enforce breach of agreement 
more rights for tenants. Less intrusion by real estate. Timely maintenance. Property MUST have all repairs done before leasing out to new tenant.
Have a landlord that wants to keep up to date with Maintenance 
I have to pay rent using the Deft payment system.  I would love to not be charged fees for a system that the real estate makes us as renters use.
more transparency when requesting maintenance issues
Rent that pays for other people's mortgage investment
Property owners appear to have less control over their own property.
There are too many rights protector the tenant and not enough protecting the owner
A longer lease than one year. 
"Improved property maintenance system or some form of certification. (similar to a roadworthy certificate)
In the 33 years i have been renting this has always been an issue especially for lower income renters in cheaper housing as it is often difficult to get any action when real estate agents don't want to tell the owners about problems that will incur costs and therefore chew up investors (owners) profits.
Reporting them to the Residential Tenancies Authority is an option that can often have repercussions for the tenant more than any other party."
Make property managers more accountable
"The majority of problems are caused by the lack of empathy and lackadaisical attitude of the middlemen - the real estate agents. They do not care about the interests of either the tenants or the landlords - their fees are all that matters to them. In my case, I reported leaking toilets and an inoperative electric oven 10 days ago to no avail. The landlord has been charged for 4 property inspections that have not occurred. At my previous address, most of my requests were ignored by that particular agent. If anything happens outside normal business hours - bad luck."
No need to change anything.
Being able to put posters on my kids walls so it feels like a home not just a house
"I would be putting a rental price freeze on, I know you have rental assistance and the NRAS but honestly single people, pensioners etc are struggling when you consider a pensioner brings in just over $800 a fortnight with rent assistance, and the lowest rents are over 300 a week unless it's a hovel and usually in high crime rate and low socioeconomic area's which aren't safe meaning our most vulnerable are left out in the cold,  how can they afford it, it's really wrong. My brother has to live in a caravan park to survive all I can see is more homeless, in a dream world people could go home and live with family and friends etc. But this is not a great world. My husband and I pay $650 a fortnight nearly a third of what we bring in including rent assistance and NRAS. and we need to get back to public housing, When capitalism was first brought forward there were several issues recognised as being a problem so to get it passed through they introduced the welfare state, public housing, school, hospitals etc but over the years this has all been eroded away."
Landlord rules to be fairer towards tenants when breaking leases
to be notified when a service is to take place
"1. too much invasion of privacy - information requested : if u can pay, have good references & have never been blacklisted u shouldnt have to prove yourself so much.  2. there is not enough houses to rent, prices are too high, houses are bad conditions & there is not enough cheap options for single people wanting to live alone."
"I have been ripped off several times by New Zealanders who have done a ""midnight flit"". Also I have had problems with dogs and animals in the house. The carpet has been ripped, left stained and flea infested. What protection is there for the home owner? I received no compensation for the ripped carpet which was only a year old when the tenants moved in!"
That landlords can not dictate whether or not you can have pets.
I have had to rely on public housing to house me because I could not get a rental through an agency with NO rental history  I would change how long it took me to get my own place. Living under my parents roof was abusive and I felt stuck until I became homeless. Finally after taking handouts I got a house but its not home.
"Rental price should be much cheaper
The Government needs to invest much more money in housing for poor people
"
"In my experience, all agents treat ALL tenants as equals... like they are criminals!  They have no respect or courtesy for the good tenants who do the RIGHT thing and treat a rental respectfully."
Greater flexibility with pets
"Reduced or No house inspections.
Pets allowed without approval."
"Classifications of wear and tear at the end of a tenancy agreement.
Able to make minor improvements to make the house more homely."
Getting things repaired
After many years of renting through agents I have been renting privately for the last 15 years and have come to the conclusion that most agents don't care about the owners or the tenants just bout how much money they can make.I think owners should be more in touch with the agents and tenants and therefore more aware of what is going on.
Length of lease agreements available 
Tenants should have to give more than 2 weeks notice to vacate a property.
"Notice of intention to leave or not to renew lease should be even for tenant and landlord.  The balance of 2 weeks compared to 2 months is unreasonable.  Speaking as a landlord and a tenant:  Landlord it is unsettling to know that the tenant can up and leave with 2 weeks notice, but we have to plan 2 months in advance.  As a tenant, I have had the negative experience of being in a six month lease and forced to re-sign or vacate by the Agent whose policy is to routinely send out a lease at 4 months with notice to leave if you don't re-sign.   "
More spontaneity from the landlord.  More response from the agent as we do not receive replies when we email with a problem.
"Strict rules on tenants vacating the property.
i.e. mandatory for tenant to provide receipts for cleaning, carpet cleaning & pest control from reputable company and not providing receipts from back yard cowboys operating off an ABN"
Lower rent prices. Make more places pet friendly
Being able to attach baby and child safety attachments to walls. I cannot currently secure bookshelves and other furniture to walls for example and i can only use temporary baby gates. I would also like to be able to hang things on walls such as photos or artworks. I would also like more than 1 week notice for inspections. I would also like to be able to put privacy screen on my balcony.
"Some real estate agents need to update their knowledge on the rights of tenants and to listen when they have genuine complaints....especially to do with violence, intimidation, bullying, etc."
Make smoking illegal outside within a certain distance of the building.
"pet ownership for a tenant is really strict, could be relieved as it is in other states."
That the owner treat the rental property as he was living there and attend to painting etc.
"For those on a pension, rents are in excess of 50% of your income.  Rents are way too high!"
"part payment of bond should be always allowed, not just if the agent agrees."
"Landlords shouldnt be able to refuse pets except in exceptional circumstances (ie body corporate rules). It seems that ""no pets"" is the default position because landlords see the property as an investment only. It is the tennants home and a pet can be an important part of family life. The landlords interests can be protected by way of additional bond if necessary,"
Far too much personal information is requested from prospective tenants in the rental application. If you are applying to rent the property you can obviously afford it. Having to provide proof of income is ridiculous. This information if forcefully obtained from agents since they say they will not process your application without it.
Not having to pay for full water cost. .
"Allowing pets for every rental, would improve mental health in Australia. "
"Security - end no reason evictions
Not allowed to treat as home- no pictures on walls or reasonable nails on wall etc 
Time frames- owners are not required to act if maintence requests in any set time frames, in some cases leaving issues on going for extended time frames "
"Having to sign a new lease each year is way over the top. I've already proven that I'm a good tenant and I don't see why I can't return to a month-by-month lease. Having to commit to another year screams of landlord-bias, meaning that I'm stuck paying for two properties if my circumstances change and I have to move. Where is the incentive for the landlord to re-tenant the property while I'm stuck paying for it for the rest of the lease?"
"Just very recent , my brand new home was destroyed by the  irresponsibility tenant which I have to spend
high amount of  monies to fix the the new home and also lost of rentals as well. This is pushing up my insurance to very high."
No changes required.  Owners must retain control of their property as they are the ones with vast amounts of money invested in them.  Renters have no responsibilities or money invested and should not gain rights that could lead to the destruction of the property.
"long term lease, eg, 5-10 yrs with inspection every 6mths."
Rents are way too high. Landlords who are told you want a forever lease and they agree and then they sell and 12 months down the track you're looking for somewhere else to rent. More dual living properties would be great so that 2 families get cheaper rent.
That the landlord or property managers have a time limit for repairs 
Allow pets in all rentals 
more places to rent for pensioners
Less routine inspections which have high conditions 
We have asked our landlord several times if we could have a small pet ie. a dog and have been denied both times.  Yet other tenants in the block were permitted to have a cat and the Landlords daughter was permitted to haver her Pommeranium in her unit.....the inequity is glaringly obvious.
"As we age, the fear of having to move weighs heavily on us. We'd like to be more sure that our tenancy length can be more assured."
How harsh exiting is. Sometimes even with a perfect bond clean the expectations are set up so that you always loose some bond money. 
"not much support for the renters. property's very often are at a very low standard for the high cost and inadequate  services provided. 

I would change this by giving the renters more support(eg an equivalent to a property manager) . being harder on the real estate agents(eg regarding manipulation and bullying tactics they use)  and creating a standard that all rental properties must meet and services they must offer."
the fix term leases don't give you any flexibility 
Cost of renting housing is increasingly taking up a higher percentage of my income.
"I've had some rough landlords in the past who've bullied me and my children. One thing I'd change is standing up for myself more, arming myself with information on my rights as a tenant from the RTA."
"Make QCAT more fair - the judge makes decisions based off of their personal feelings, not legislation."
Regulations around renting with pets is ridiculous. You are essentially locked out of the market in some areas if you attempt to rent with a pet.
"More availability for animals to be kept. Some places have the fencing etc for a dog, but won't allow it. Not all animals are going to create havoc in a yard."
The expectations from tentants by the real estates 
To make it easier to get a rental with a dog 
longer leases for older people especially when one of the couple has disabilities and moving is both expensive and very hard when owners decide to sell
"No changes, we are very happy with the house and our landlord of 3 years is excellent, we enjoy looking after the house for ourselves and the landlord."
"I think both real estate agents and tenants or landlords and tenants should do the property inspection entry reports and exit reports together.  
If this is not possible, then tenants should have longer than 3 days to complete this as by the time they move in and try and get sorted, it is a rush to complete the entry report within 3 days and issues with the property get left off the report "
Actual penalties for tenants who wilfully damage homes. 
Property maintenance needs to be more regular and the prices for renting for low income families needs to be better.
It is not an even system the real estates are bullies. It would be great if it was more transparent industry and it would be great if real estates where removed from being able to rent properties.
"1) After 6yrs renting a unit my bond was witheld for cleaners to make the unit spotless, even after I cleaned every surface. After moving I was too physicaly and emotionally drained to complain and fight this R/E claim. Im sure I would have to phone 3-4 people, request a form to be sent, have witnesses, take photos etc. And after this I probably would have been flagged officially or unofficially as a bad renter. After 6yrs and my cleaning this unit was not ""spotless"" but was not dirty either. I think I received a $12 bond cheque refund.
2) The walls are too thin, Im sick of hearing neighbors cough, burp, snore, wash dishes, eat their dinner, flush their toilet. Even front doors are cheap bedroom doors with no noise buffering from traffic"
"I moved into my unit in May and I pay a reduced rent under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. I believe that deal is to end before the end of the year. I’m concerned along with several of my neighbours how much my rent will increase once this Scheme ends.
Will the Qld government subsidies our rent. If it increases too much I may be homeless as I only live on the Aged Pension."
"change the rental rules to make property owners accountable for the moving costs of tenants when they fail to remedy  breach to maintain a property, and the tenants are then forced to stay in unmaintaned property or leave. the property owners who fail to remedy breach should be placed on a register for future  tenants who are renting properties to view. this would be fair because tenants get placed on registers etc for their faults, so should the owners"
that you can put things on walls or paint walls if you like decorate it as if its your own 
"Ensure tenants who rent are more accountable for property damage caused by them or any pets/animals they have taken into or allowed to remain at the property, and also for financial losses by the property owner due to the tenants negligence or error."
Put some laws in place to protect tenants from unscrupulous real estate agents & landlords. 
"Bond.
House owners use this as an advantage to secure rent from tennants.
It is expected, in most cases that you renew your bondbefore expiration, if you don't, the house owner already knows you are planning to vacate the house.
The bond issue should be reviewed."
Better communication and faster replies to repairs or enquiries..
Noone should be allowed to enter the property without tenants being at home or give concent
"As a property owner I find it is becoming far too difficult to remove tenants that have either not paid rent for a number of weeks, destroyed parts of the property, involved with drugs or will not remove pets that are there illegally. It takes far too long to get to court or remove them legally."
Approval to put pictures on wall
I think the without grounds evictions should be abolished I think if a person is to be evicted it should be transparent and for reasons like trashing the property or non-payment of rent. this happened to me and had a devastating effect on my life both financially and emotionally 
Corrupt real estates keeping bonds or part bonds stating the house is filthy when it’s not. In our case we moved into a filthy house
Better response times for non-emergency repairs
"More respect form property managers, though we are renting it is still our home.
Less inspections when tenants have been long term.
No photos of property at every inspection unless damage has occurred since last inspection.
More open to having pets with conditions of course."
I would like our back yard to be fixed up. At the moment it is only dirt.
I am a Landlord and have not rented a property since 2011
Mandatory solar hot water and power. 
Make landlords do repairs without putting up the rent. And allow pets.
Able to have pets with no restrictions
"The kids wish we were allowed to have a cat. Happy to pay any extras when finding new accommodation, which will be a long time coming as we have been living here for over 6 years.

Would love to make garden beds, but due to mower man this is not allowed."
"Changes to periodic leasing, being told sign another 6 -12 month lease or vacate rental after two months for no reason at all is ludicrous"
"Respect and privacy.
The agency decides when they inspect and have had these inspections when I was very sick or my daughter was in the middle of yr 12 final exams- and we still had the inspection - they could not postpone by a few days until her exams were finished. "
Owners compensation renters when they sell the house. Having strangers coming through my house. My contents being on line with my address. Pushy pushy rental girls with hearts of steel. 
"I have had a very hard time finding rentals that accept my cat. I live alone, so a pet is very beneficial to me. So allowing pets would be a real bonus."
Agents need to be held to a higher standard. They are letting some tenants get away with so much. And you shouldn't have specialists as owners and tenants need continuity not talking to 5 or 6 different people about the 1 property. It's frustrating and no one takes ownership. 
"Better record-keeping by rental companies to ensure the correct people are charged for damages, despite changes in staffing and tenants. "
Make the application process easier 
More accountability held by real estate agents and owners
"Having more rights, my car was parked on the road in front of the house we rent, it was smashed by a motorist and the real estate told us that we had to talk to them about these things, even though it was not on the property.  I would like to feel like it is my home, but no renter ever feels that, because they are there to inspect and remind us that it is not our home."
Lower rent closer to city.  Public/Government housing is inner city yet those of us not getting government assistance pay high rents way out of the city
I think stability for long term renters is a key issue. 
stop giving crappy tenants all the power - my property was destroyed over $10k damage in 7 months and because they paid their rent the magistrate said there was NO comeback - insurance covered $6k we were left with the rest. NO blacklisting NO financial loss. its disgusting 
Change house inspections to the beginning of each contract period.  Every three months is excessive and takes away tenants privacy and feels intrusive.
"Greater access to own rental history, particularly as there is no transparency of 'bad reviews' if you have a bad experience with a Real Estate company property manager."
Regulate and enforce a noise curfew
Allowances for tenants that improve their property. Makes sense that good tenants that improve properties get rewarded with a rating higher than others. 
Tenants require maintenance constantly.  I don’t have the problems that they have because I take care of my home.
Owners being more flexible and approachable. Also breaking lease fee shouldn't be charged when moving out before time. Also the having a option to Rent to Own houses if owner was agreeance to it. 
Make renting more affordable and less intrusive by agents etc it's dehumanising!
If your living on newstart its hard to find a rental in your budget. 
Being able to clean your rented house for vacation and not being forced to use a blind cleaner that costs basically all your bond
More notice before entry onto property as well as notice-to-sell. The 7 day rule (when required) isn't always adhered to either. No one can have a house ready for an open house so quickly when they have jobs.
Being allowed to have pets on the property and not having to pay a fee for each animal weekly. 
Having  more properties that allow pets
Being required to provide 2 months notice as a landlord but only receiving 2 weeks notice from a tenant does not provide sufficient time to plan around a vacating tenant.  A tenant should also be required to provide the same 2 months notice as a landlord to address significant financial consequences to a landlord due to unexpected vacancy 
"Nothing. My property manager is great. I would avoid dealing with real estate agencies though, because they tend to be onerous."
"Increase the bond, it is not sufficient to cover, cleaning, small items of damage, and perhaps a couple of weeks behind in the rent."
"Stop landlord's being able to give a tenant notice to leave without cause. My landlord owns 8 units, he rents one out to a friend of his, the friend spies on all of the other tenants and reports back to the owner. The friend has narcissistic personality disorder, as a result he walks around as if he owns the place constantly complaining about everyone and everything, often lying or grossly exaggerating, trying to control everything, snooping around, eavesdropping, playing everyone against each other, creating drama, rumors. He's a bigot and targets anyone he doesn't like or those who criticize him, then over time works towards having them evicted at the end of their leases by gradually manipulating the landlord. In 5 years he's had 6 neighbors directly next door to him, most broke their leases to get away from him, one didn't have their lease renewed, all were perfect tenants who paid their rent, took care of the property and were respectful and considerate. "
Longer terms minimum 1 year or longer
Currently i am happy with the all of my experiences. 
As an owner I would like to see more inspection of the rental property.
Relax restrictions of small animals in rental properties
Responsibilities of property managers/landlords
Higher bonds need to be paid. Pet bond needs to be paid
Flexibility with breaking lease after staying for an extended period of time.  I've been stuck in the same property for 8 years now because I cannot find a property more suitable for my family without breaking lease.  Rental company/landlord denies requests to be flexible to vacate.  I cannot afford to pay rent at multiple properties for more than a few weeks so I'm stuck living in the same house. 
My landlord only allowed outdoor dogs 
The process of competing for a place even though you have really good references and a track record.
lower agent fees
"Education at school, so people know more about what is required to rent what is expected of tenants and owners."
"I wish there were more houses available that allow pets. I don’t want to change the current rights of owners to allow or disallow pets, but perhaps some more protection for owners for when they do allow pets will increase he number of owners willing to allow them. The pet bond that’s been mentioned sounds good, or something else to help protect owners against damage.
The only poor experience I’ve had renting is due to agency incompetence. "
"The real estate agents take advantage of vulnerable tenants keeping the bond for any reason, leaving tenants out of pocket. There should be a limit in timing to return the bond and the reasons why they keep it must be reviewed."
I would make real estate agents and owners be more transparent. They lie to tenants about their responsibilities whilst not following the Rental Tenancy Act themselves. 
"Fair notice periods when vacating a property - one or two months notice for both parties, not just landlords."
"Tougher laws on Real Estate Agents and they should be made accountable. Every property I have ever rented has never been properly cleaned nor checked either by the agent, as with never ending maintenance problems, they just don't care. Change Entry Condition Report return date to 2 weeks, currently not long enough. As you are to tired/ exhausted from moving to complete and check everything within 3 days and also it is not enough time to thoroughly check all! As you haven't been in the property long enough by 3 days to see what works or not etc."
Less inspections after 12 months with one tenancy. More properties that allow pets.
"For fixed period leases an option should exist, at the sole discretion of the tenant, for the term of the lease to  be increased from 12 months to (say) 5 years."
Minimum experience for property managers.
"cheaper rent, more animal friendly rentals."
harsher penalties for site managers / agents who don't follow the legislative requirements
An impartial assessment of the handover condition of the property.
"Hard to pick only one thing. Reduce rental prices, more properties that allow pets"
Have more properties allow pets (dog)
Pets - as a renter I’m often knocked back due to pets but they are an important part of family life teaching kids empathy respect and responsibility. Owners need to realise not all pets cause damage and renters with good pet records should be given a star rating or something to communicate that. 
More places accepting pets
The amount and frequency of rent increases.
"Have single rental properties amongst normal housing, not large blocks of rental only premises"
"privately renting is great in some ways but harder in others,our electricity is in owners name as the house isn’t the only thing on the property but would be better if house ran seperate on its own metre"
"1. No administration fees from real estates. Example: $50 admin fee for resigning the lease at a property or ending a lease 

2. Real estates to not be money hungry putting on anything they can to get money out of you. Example: trying to make you pay for a call out fee because the hot water system stopped working 

3. Owner to not be told if tenant has a small pet when applying for a property. This way they can’t base their approval or disapproval on that fact. 
"
"I would not use this real estate again as they clearly do not adhere to any regulations. One week notice before inspections, threatening eviction unless more rent is paid for alleged illegally kept pets"
Landlords charging for breakages that was already there. Need an easier way to prove they were already there
"Allow tenants to have pets. Judge each tenant on a case to case basis. You get good and bad tenants, and responsible and irresponsible tenants. Allow those that are responsible and clean with their pets to have them. Don't have a blanket ban on pets for most rental properties."
Long term leases . having a 6 Mth or 12 Mth lease is to short . We need a 5 year or 10 year period where there is stability . It is very stressful having to find another property in a short time frame . 
Cheaper rental prices 
Rights to break the lease if owner is selling 
Go back to long term leases
Timeframes in which in you can negotiate renewal of lease before expiry
Clearer information for accessible housing
To be allowed to have a pet live in the house.
As a landlord if a tenant isn't paying rent or taking care of the property appropriately notice to vacate should be shorter.
"Ability to choose to convert to periodic lease, especially after having signed an initial fixed period lease of one year, rather than being forced to sign another fixed term agreement."
Real estate bad behaviour to tennets 
There be a limit of how much the landlord can increase the rent at time of renewal. E.G. Ours jumped up by $25.00 a week
Australian Govt removed landlords claiming expenses to visit rental properties approx 12 months ago. A landlord can Not ensure a property is maintained to a high standard if he does not inspect property. Therefore this taxation deduction should be reinstated immediately.
Lengthen lease time to min of 5years
"Every year our rent is increased by an arbitrary $10 per week, yet the property continues to age with no improvement works done - only the bare necessities and maintenance "
"Property manager issues. They are nice but has been taking advantage of our professionalism. 

* I have now put my foot down and said we as tenants would not be making the appointments direct with third parties, that need to come in and do maintenance on the house as it is required.
* Stretching out completing maintenance/upgrades on the house, to more than 2 months.
"
"Stability in a home - the thought of moving again in my 70s is very unnerving  
Not having to move so often 
I’m 60+ so getting an inspection regularly further indicates I’m not in a stable home. 
Constant rent increases 
Property not maintained 
Property being sold. 
Can’t feel as if proposing home due to the above - tenants paying for landlords home. We can be asked to move before contract. "
Transparency re bond claims from agents
the lies need to stop and rental agents need to be more open. Allowing for changes and help others live better and safer
"the real estate should carry out maintenance when asked and not only when you are due to sign for another lease. Pest control not done annually only once a blue moon.  In cases of mold: told to clean it myself and i am an asthmatic??. Ask to have outside of house cleaned due to mold on the eves, nothing done about it/ignored. i have been in the property for over 7 years, and get treated like this!!! Cheap Locks put into doors, landlord doesn't care about safety specially in the area i'm in. Landlords don't care as long as their paid. They also replace stuff with cheap crap!!! "
inspection times to view properties.  when you work full time it is hard to get time off to go and view a property as most times they are from 9am to 4 pm.   Real Estates also need to be prompt in replying to prospective tenants who wish to view their properties. 
"Make sure tenant are liable for damages, misuse, and issues they cause to the property during their tenancy period I respective of the bond amount held.

Currently if tenant damage the property owner can use the bond, however most of issues these days even proper cleaning of the property to a level that can be rented again is costly and bond is not sufficient to address basic issues, and the owner should go to court and cost a lot a get compensated if the owner win the case.

Insurance also does not pay for accidental damage only pay for melisous damages subject to providing police report.

I suggest to increase the bond amount."
"Minimum Standards for rental properties, ensuring that they meet and or exceed the BCA guidelines."
Renting should grow equity somehow... not having the money for a deposit penalises the poor. All my rent money goes toward paying off someone else's asset.
Closer check on property managers . Our first pm for this property as now been convicted of fraud and theft 
"Increase the bond on rentals as the current amount (4 * weekly rent) does little to cover the risk of damage to the property.  By the time basic cleaning costs are applied (carpet shampoo, clean, & flea treatment) there is little to go towards damage.  This is especially the case with call out fees for trades ranging from $80 to $100.
In addition no allowance is made for time lost while repairs are being effected albeit costs such as rates are charged on the passage of time.
If a tenant leaves without completing the cleaning and repairs it is generally an indication that a claim against them for compensation is futile and not commercially viable."
"More affordable housing for low-income & centrelink clients.

Flexibility to to hang pictures & personalise/decorate (within reason) and build gardens."
"High standards of properties (mold IS NOT ACCEPTABLE), maintenance being done without retirbution, pets allowed without asking, landlords & property managers not acting like they rule your entire life. renewal of lease at tennants decision at end of term not that they can just terminate, understanding what fair wear and tear actually is."
"Education for Tenants with regards to legislation, particularly surrounding understanding payment ledgers. "
Owners doing maintenance in a time frame
Direct access to reports on landlords and tenants history. Like a credit rating or star rating for each.
Difficulty in communicating with real estate/lack of responses 
"Pets should be allowed in properties. Overously provideing you can care for them and being respectful of the owner. 
 Having to get rehome your dog /cat due to no housing in a small community is hard on families 

"
That i had more options to pay my rent other than through a company that charges me money to pay my rent
More rights for landlords when tenants don't pay rent or damage property
Landlords and real estates being fairer toward tenants
"A larger bond to be held, as once tenants give notice to leave they stop paying rent and any damage is not covered by the bond."
Should be allowed to Fine Tenants should they repeat a breach of tenancy conditions within same Lease period and they have already been issued a breach notice once for the same breach of tenancy conditions (ie parking on Strata common property again when they have been issued a breach for this already)
"Property manager training. Property managers are hopelessly under-trained and under-supervised. They frequently submit the first application for the owner's consideration, not the best one - resulting in the loss of excellent tenants and the ongoing problems that come with grubby or criminal tenants... and due to a lack of training and supervision, can't identify the problem in time."
Allowing pets.  Some properties that don't low them leave families devastated because they have to get rid of their pets so they have a place to live. 
Improve the rights of a tenant.
"Better definitions around acceptable wear and tear, property managers that act in the interests of the tenants (the customer) rather than the landlords."
Clearer definitions of wear and tear. Tenants do not seem to be responsible nor held to account for any damage or wear and tear.
More right for landlords with regards to unreasonable maintenance requests
"Having more power to make slight changes/modifications to the property
Prompt response times from property managers/landlords for maintenance issues"
"A better process to ensure Property Managers aren't one sided. Meaning Property Managers that create issues for tenants when vacating the property and making them pay for things that shouldn't be the tenants responsibility, such as structural damage (cracks) to a building.  Even after going through the mediation process I was forced to pay for the damages."
"Having a system for tenants to rate landlords. There is so much scrutiny placed on tenants and their rental history etc, however tenants do not know what they are getting themselves into in terms of the tenant-landlord relationship, until they have signed a lease. Some people may be perfectly good tenants, and then sign a lease with the landlord from hell, and not be able to do much about it.

If there was a way to share landlord ratings, this may allow tenants to feel more informed about their prospective leasing situation, and it may also lead to more accountability by the landlords themselves - if they know they are being rated, they may try to lift their game more, and not be dodgy landlords."
I wish there was more consistency in the advertising and descriptions of properties online such as on Realestate.com. Sometimes it’s hard to  decipher the features of a property and it’s conditions. 
Direct contact with landlords
Rental inpsections every quarter
To be able to have access to longer term rental agreements. Three year agreements would be great.
"It would be great to see owners of rented premises, have a certain amount of money in holdings so that 
Real Estate Agencies have the power to get repairs done and pay immediately.
Sick of having to wait for things to be done (fixed)
Instead of owners saying you don't use it all the time. "
"*A lease should be a minimum of 12 months, with the tenant having the option of choosing 6 months if they needed
*Any increases in rent should be capped at between $10 and $20, as some tenants, especially those with limited incomes live in fear of not being able to no longer afford their rent
*All properties should be pet friendly as many families and/or single people class their pets as part of their family, and also many pets are used as companion animals for people with disabilities, but the tenant needs to be prepared to treat the property with respect and responsibility. e.g. keeping the yard and carpets clean etc.
*That the RTA should be legislated to have the only power when blacklisting a tenant
"
Allow longer term leases
"'-More pet friendly properties
-Better response to maintenance requests"
Add a cooling off period of 1 month so if the property or the neighbours turn out to not be what was advertised you have an opportunity to pay a fee and move back out no red tape involved.
The equal dispersal of the bond at the end of a tenancy. If one tenant proves disruptive and stops paying rent the unit tenants should not lose their bond
"Better able to make tenents pay for damage to renatal property. Tenents can stop paying rent two - four weeks before they leave, depart the premise in a mess and then be impossible to track down. The apparent ""bad tenant"" list that agents keep, I find out, is one of many lists, so bad tenants just shop around till they find an agent that uses a deferent list. This is not just a rental propery that I have bought with spare cash lying around, I am required to work away for months at a time, and when not rented- it is my home !"
"Ensure tenants that default on their contract are held accountable so good tenants are not treated judged poorly and ""put in the same basket"".
"
Hard to get bad tenants out. By the time you do bond is completely used up. 
"Clearer rules on what needs to be done each year eg. pest inspections, smoke alarm tests etc"
The fear tenants have of making a complaint or requesting repairs due to the lack of affordable rental accommodation on the Gold Coast and not wanting to lose the place they have.
Better communication options with the owner.
"More properties allowing for pets. 
"
As a Landlord it would be good if property prices would rise in Rural Areas. They have been in a slump for almost 5 years.
larger bond equal to 6 weeks rent
I dislike having photos taken of my home for the real estate to send to the owners.
Nothing if the law stays the same
Increase bond amount to better cover tenants leaving properties without cleaning them and with damage.
"The tribunal is biased towards tenants, the tribunal rules do not protect access to justice (or fair hearing) for litigants and there’s too many shady property managers who give bad advice or bad service "
"As we are in our 70's and will never own a house and will die before getting a Housing Commission house we feel longer term leases - longer than one year, should be made available for private renters to give a better feeling of security, because at our age getting kicked out because the owner wants to sell sees it almost impossible to re rent, and Public Housing availability is many years away for us."
"I would change;
* the rights if the tenant to negotiate the lease terms by giving a cooling off period.
*the time it takes to complete a entry condition report is inadequate and needs to be 2 weeks. 
* the routine inspections to once every 6 months with video conferencing an option.
*QCAT being discharged of their role in tenancy disputes and a jury in place of courts and financially qualified tenants advised to skip QCAT as it isn't a fair process and they're to be advised of their basic human right to legal representation at the first opportunity, with a counselling support service.
* a separate dispute resolution service for carers and disabled people.
* no threats to get a warrant for vacant possession for disabled people, carers or children, rather a support service to help them.
* Landlords must be required to have their name on the tenancy agreement - not the real estate instead because the tenant is giving up every aspect of their privacy so why shouldn't the landlord be required to give their name at least by law.
* Landlord should be called ""landlords"" anymore, its politically incorrect and intimidating jargon. Property owner would be sufficient.
* ALL electrical circuits, including ceiling lights should be required by law to have circuit breakers on them.
* All realestates should have a privacy and ethical standards audit every 3 months, with their issues resolved within 3 months after that and a public feedback government system that makes them accountable for how well or poorly they look after tenants.
* locksmiths should be employed to change the locks on every new lease especially for people who are disabled or for women and children.
*Tenants should be offered incentives for installing security cameras cctv etc to decrease crimes.
*Tenants should have more room to get things fixed, rather than only being eligible for reimbursements on emergency repairs and only if they can prove that no one answered the after hours number. It's not good enough to have to live with a house in disrepair with only urgent jobs attended to - especially if the problem is an obvious risk to health or safety of tenants.
*a reduction in rent should be automatic if the property is reduced in a capacity such as air conditioning or hit water service failure for example - not negotiable.
*Animals should be allowed at all residences.

"
Greater access to pet friendly homes. 
Make it safer for owners.
"More flexibility with lease periods for either shorter or longer terms, and including the option that landlords must offer periodic leases after the initial lease period.  As a tenant the inflexibility makes it very difficult to plan life around leases, and it can be extremely expensive to break a lease. Perhaps setting a maximum break lease fee if unable to secure a new tenant could assist so landlords are still protected and tenants."
Change legislation regarding notice periods and harmonise rental rules nationally.
"More control over bad tenants. Especially if tenants damage the property and leave the property very dirty.

I love animals but not all people will make sure that the animal does not damage the flooring."
End rolling contracts as the default setting for homes. 
Tenants be more accountable for damage they cause
"Tougher laws regarding the living conditions. Eg, mould, gardens, etc."
"For starters, the Participant-Criteria is flawed: ""If you rent, own or manage a rental property in Queensland we want to hear from you"" (as I rented for many years before recently becoming owner-occupier). 

Tenants are treated as a temporary disposable resource. Minimum 5 year leases must be legislated. "
Cheaper rent and/or more rental subsidies
The annual renewal. I had a job opportunity away from Brisbane but no way to get out of my rental contract. I didn't take the job.
"Too many young, inexperienced property managers out there. Needs to be better regulation of the industry"
"I’ve been a tenant since moving to QLD since moving here in 1993. I am a good tenant. I have been living in my current home for 12 years. If I were a homeowner, it would be reasonable to paint the property, new carpets etc. Apart from minor maintenance over the years, the landlords have spent minimal money on my current property, and I bet they claim a loss each year on their tax returns. I requested security screens, after a spate of robberies in the complex, that was knocked back. I am about to request air con upstairs where the daytime temperature in summer was around 37 degrees, in the bedrooms during the day, and not much cooler at night. We’ll see how we go with that request!"
"Have tenants notify real estate of issues when they are first noticed, not when they have become major issue that requires urgent attention. 
e.g. leaking tap, not when the tap cannot be turned off.
e.g. when front door lock is difficult to unlock with both keys, nt when the lock has fully ceased and the tenant cannot use the door."
Lower council rates
"I am fed up with increasingly onerous conditions placed on renting out my property, along with increasing costs.  
"
"Pets at properties should be allowed, on lease and pet bonds. With standards of cleanliness also and on 2nd breach they have to vacate. Pets are family and apart of a happier full life. "
"Have had bad experiences with tenants who have not paid rent, caused damaged and repair costs have been incurred.
While i know what is required as a tenant, however there are some tenants who do not fulfil their contract and as a property owner it is fruitless to follow through with such tenants and more effective avenues for pursuing costs for damage, unpaid rent and items removed from the property need to be in place. There are also wonderful tenants who adhere to their contract."
Able to put paintings and pictures on the walls.
landlords not selling the house and therefore having to have multiple inspections
If your a good tenant less inspections and not having to ask for every little change if it doesn't damage property.
Have property managers complete a real course/study with real certification before they are able to perform/take on that position no in house rubbish.
It is becoming far more common for tenants to want to break lease with a complicated process to do anything but accept the situation. The periodic terms do not make it attractive for landlords to want to offer this due to such short vacate notice times.
consistency with agents and better policing of agent who treat tenants badly or go by their own rules- tenant are often at the whim of narcissistic real estate agents.  A separate body with an ombudsman to report bad behaviour to to hold real estate agents more accountable not just the RTA as I feel although they do what they can where it comes to bad behaviour the RTA are powerless to help tennants.
Better screening of tenants
That real estate agents didn't expect a tenantsd property to look like new. 
Very pushy agencies who regard all tenants as the enemy a d refuse to or take too long to do valid repairs. I have previously rented in NSW and have also rented out my own home. I have a high paying career and excellent references yet find agents tend to treat all tenants in an appalling manner. To have repairs done is a nightmare. I lived in a house that was flooded in 2011. The agency employee who conducted the next inspectoon had the gall to state that they hsd heard I flooded the house when it was a result of the flooding occurring in my suburb resulting from the flooding of the brisbane river
Preventing landlords from giving two months notice to leave without reason
That the realestate be easier to be in contact with and return calls and emails in a timely manner. 
Less frequent inspections of you've proven to be a good tenant. Better guarantee of length of lease (tired of constantly having to move/ inspect numerous properties).
A regular email advising of upcoming changes to Qld tenancies for absentee landlords with plenty of notice period for changes.
"having everything in writing and photos not only from me but from the property manager/landlord also.  Everything is fine at start of rental but when things go wrong or you need something, photos and communication in writing. The owner of the rental could perhaps listen to a request, like having an air conditioner that is full of mould cleaned by a fully qualified accredited mould removal specialist, not just an electrical contractor who doesn't follow strict guidelines on safe mould removal, and then having the owner of the rental property decide that we are difficult tenants, easier to kick us out..."
Bullying from owner and management.
"If expenses in owing a property increase, rents should also increase. I am a retiree who relies on the rental income."
Give more power back to owners to ensure their investment is looked after so owners want to keep their investment properties.
"As a retiree, and a landlord rent should be pegged to CPI, so that there is some relief to the spiraling cost of having a rental unit. When I first bought 25% approx would go towards expenses, now it is closer to 50%."
Holding the owner accountable for making repairs to the property without fear of eviction 
Quite content with the way things currently are
"As a Landlord - when malicious damage is done to a premise there is only the bond to repatriate the costs, quite often this amount is severely insufficient to cover these costs.
Agents need to have more power to conduct proper inspections and allowance for repairs to be conducted to premises"
Rental agencies no care attitude towards a renter. 
Tenants are held accountable to damaging properties.  
"Repairs done in a timely manner
Water bills sent regularly  not  18mths worth 3 weeks before Xmas
Replace worn out carpets
Being able to talk to the owners directly ( agent is not doing his job owners should be aware)"
That kanlirds take notice of issues with houses they are renting out
Tenants to take responsibility for keeping the property clean and tidy.  Typically we have had a good run of tenants.  However our latest are leaving their business waste at the house and then saying it is not theirs - leaving it to us to clean up.  Also letting garden run over and when doing gardening leaving the waste in a pile on the ground.
"A rental property is like a business and can affect someone's livelihood, both the owner (employer) and renter (employee). There needs to be a clearer contract between both parties to give direction and comfort of the future to all. ie set rental period, set notice period, set rules. Then everyone knows the ground rules being worked with."
"I have rented in the same property for 4 years, it as a complex, all the same, yet every year my rent increases by $10. I am mow paying rent at $440 a week, where others in the same complex, exactly same townhouse start paying $400, I understand inflation but think it's unfair. I think rents should be capped especially when all homes are in a complex and exactly the same. I am a single mother and simply cannot afford to move. "
"Recovering all expenses from bond at end of lease at end of lease. While recovering unpaid rent is straight forward, other expenses to get property back to clean and tidy state for next tenants is sometimes difficult to recover. Root cause is probably more the failure of letting agent than anything else."
Annual rent increases 
Fairer bond assessments.
Equal time frames of notice to vacate or end lease for both tenant and landlord. Ie 1 month. Two weeks notice is not long enough to find a new tenant. 
More power for tenants as there’s a great imbalance.
Too much power in the hands of the tenant
Better service from the real-estate agent
Make it like Europe where renting feels like your own home and not a transient 6 month arrangement.
I would improve the breadth and frequency of independent oversight for the activities of real estate agents.
Owners of rental properties must have right of ownership as to decide in any matters affecting the pproperty
Recognition that even a well behaved pet may leave small damage to things like a mesh on a screen door and not to charge the tenant an exorbitant amount to repair it.
"Tenant to pay for internal pest control, ants, spiders, cockies etc. Not termites, borers etc."
"Give tenants less rights, It is harder to remove a tenant in arreas than it is for a bank to reposess a house. "
"If Tenant fails in any way, their name shouldn't be removed off the black list as they call it  so other rental owners are aware of them."
"We have had a horrific experience twice in the last couple of years with owners selling the property. The tenants get no compensation or rent decrease even though they are expected to do open houses, remove pets, put away all valuables and photos, have strangers coming though the house, loose your weekends for Saturday open houses, having to deal with real estate agents and loosing what feels like your home. Then the owner sells and you have to move anyway. It is very unfair that the tenants basically take on the stress of the sale, loose their privacy and peace.  I feel that the home either needs to be empty to be sold, as the owners have committed and expect the tenant to comitt to the lease.  Or the tenant on agreement, should have a rent reduction for the absolute inconvenience that selling is for the tenant.   Or that the tenant can break the lease without fee because they have the right to be in a home that is not on the market. "
"My tenant moved out before the end of her lease due to issues with ease of access. While I was allowed to retain the bond, I was let=ft out of pocket as it took longer than 4 weeks top re-tenant the flat and also because I had to pay letting and advertising fees. A tribunal allowed the tenant to flout the requirements of her lease, and while I am sympathetic to her situation, I don't feel it's ok to allow tenants to break leases without compensating the owner. So my one change would be to ensure that lease terms are enforced (or why have them)?"
"As an owner of a rental, there are a couple of things.  I guess the biggest is when tenants get late in payments the owner has a long process of notices to evict the person and whilst there is often a 4 week bond, this doesn't cover the back rent and damage that can be left.  
The other thing that is really hard as an owner is we need to give 2 months notice if we are renewing, but the tenant only needs to give 2 weeks - very one sided and doesn't give the owner a great amount of time to ensure the place is cleaned up and ready to re-rent, advertise, find tenant etc, PLUS if the tenant does stay a day or 2 longer everything is thrown out.  Should be at least a month, if not the same as landlord (2 months) that the tenant needs to give notice"
First time owner. Still learning
"Put in place a legislation requiring the mediation of rental situations. This could be the RTA who administers it, as currently the entire rental situation is out of control. Greedy owners raise rents as they please, without any mediation. Compulsory ""R E Agency""  for all rentals would remove direct tenant-to-owner situations and possibly resolve the current Air-B & B plague that is destroying living amenities for long term tenants. Good, long term tenants should also be given some kind of reference base reward."
A data base that property owners can check for bad tenants and a data base that you can register a bad tenant on.
Ensure that landlords who complete their own maintenance have the appropriate (and up to date) qualifications/trade certificate to carry out that maintenance. 
More onus is placed on tenants to maintain a property to a reasonable level.
have a third party do the inspection report for moving in or moving out. Property managers can intentionally skip problems that are relatively hidden from renters and then blame the renter when they move out. This protects the owner's interests and help the property manager maintain their contract to manage the house by dumping all liabilities onto the renter.
Improve property owners access 
Greater regulations involving property managers.
make tenants and owners right and obligations clear and balanced
More competent and aware leasing agents.
"If a landlord puts up the rent, there NEEDS to be improvement to the property within the previous 12 months

"
Clearer and more accessible information for tenants on their rights and reaponsiblities
"discretional oral or written discussions and communication between Real Estate Agents, Owners and tenants on matters in dispute"
"Body corp work and access issues to a group of units - for example the body corp pays for painting the exterior of the windows, tenants/residents are notified, but the tenants/residents don't leave the windows ajar so the painters can't paint the frames/ window sills, and the money is wasted. Then the tenants/residents complain their windows jam because they are not painted as the timber is swollen. This is one example only, others include pest extermination, organised by body corp, but if they cant access all units it doesn't get done. Tenants/residents complain of pests."
I will NEVER rent through Rain and Horne they are horrible to the tenants and will not do anything for them even when the house around them is falling down. All they cared about was the owner. 
The cost of renting the rent price can differ from $100 depending on suburb 
Real estates being more proactive in their care of tenants
"the rental commisions in QLD is too high for what is done.
too much restriction that protects the tenant and not landlord.

I am not rich but a normal low ley wage earner who does 3 jobs to buy a property in QLD"
More pet friendly accommodation
"More places allow animals / pets. Even if it comes at a higher bond. So many animals are given up for adoption because people can’t find affordable rentals that allow them to keep their pets there. From my experience, children cause more damage to property than animals do! "
we need far MORE onus on tenants to look after rental properties and be more fully financially liable for damages and any changes to the original property.
"Advised properties must be honest about appliances working order. Example 
If advertised dishwasher, oven, stovetop. All must be in good working order."
Longer lease terms if you are a proven reliable tenant.
"1. More affordable housing options.  More 1 and 2 bedroom options.
2. Mandatory Long-term leases option available.
3. Disability accessibility included in all rental ads.
4. Better access to justice options to hold landlords to account for dilapidated premises.
5.Government system to report slum accommodation with toxic health or OH&S issues - such as black mould, rotting floorboards and rotting water damaged cupboards and broken stairs.  Which can be shut down by Qld Government, such as, the work health inspectors authority to shut down restaurants trading."
more input from landlords and more responsibility on renters
Allow tenants to vacate early without any penalties
"agents taking photos of my contents, car in garage etc. feel its an invasion of my privacy, as why cant they take photos without including contents, car etc, maybe walls or windows/doors limiting how much they include..clearer guidelines on how much private goods included..next time will take my car out of garage as their photo included my rego number !!!"
 A lot of property is not pet friendly.
"Longer time notice if owner is not going to extend the lease, it is very expense to relocate, some people need time to get finances in order"
"'Having the rules a bit more fairly balanced for owners, 
eg 
- If a tenant is in rent arrears and you issue the notices and apply to QCAT on the minimum time frames and owner will be out of pocket for 2 months rent until they get vacant possession. The rules give tenants to much flexibility to do the wrong thing. Also in QCat hearings, the magistrates are able to make their own rules and give the tenants extra chances if they wish- which means more paperwork for us re-applying and the owner being out of pocket a lot more.
- We are unable to issue NRB for Water and then NTL to a tenant, so some avoid paying them. Then when we get to court on vacate, any water period that is longer than 6mths gets thrown out and tenants get away without paying it.
- In periodic lease, it should be the same rules that apply to tenant and owner, not the current (2wks tenant, 2mths owner)
- At QCat, tenants should need to provide evidence of their statements and claims- they lye a lot and have no proof to back up their statements
- Tenants that are taken to court for damages and rent, should not be a loud to leave bad reviews online due to the courts awarding the tenants to compensate owners
- If a property has a tenant that has submitted identity theft on their application in order to get a property, the poilice should be able to step in and remove the from the property for vacant possession immediately. Currently owners have to go through NRB, NTL Urgent QCAT (with the minimum time frame being 2mths until the mater gets herd.
- QCAT Warrant of Possessions should be effective as soon as the mater is heard and proceed as soon as the closest police station can book them in (by this stage owners have already lost out enough)
- Bond Amounts should be unlimited (depending on the quality of the tenant and property), that way more problematic tenants would need to pay a larger bond (protecting owners and reducing the chance that they abscond), this would increase their intentions to do the right thing. 
"
"Stop owners and landlords trespassing & Breaking & entering to look inside what is, as long as I pay my rent, legally my house &/or flat
"
"The application process, from arranging an inspection to getting approved."
I would like to be able feel less like I’m renting someone else’s house and that it felt more like our home whilst there
There needs to be more rules to protect landlords as well as renters
better security for expenses / damage caused by tenants
Stop real estates bulling renter 
I would improve the role of the Real Estate in supporting both the tenant and the owner and ensure the tenant is made to feel 'at home' in their property - with respect to their privacy.
Owners fixing things when they break.
Conditions allowing landlords/property managers to retain a large portion or ALL of the Bond.
faster response from real estate
"1.The application process is so detailed that it is virtually impossible to rent if I do not come from somewhere to go somewhere else.
2. The application to get the rental with having to see that house is difficult if transport is an issue at the same time as other places - because one must see the property before putting in the application. This is not possible in some cases esp with work or displacement there needs to be some lean lines on this one."
"Change the rental law's that favor the property owner when it comes to a issue relating to a problem in the accommodation that need attending to . I have a very leaky veranda roof which has caused paint to peal away from the wall and exposed asbestos panels and it has been six years and counting waiting for the landlord to fix the problem and still NOT fixed . A form 11 was given to the landlord a month ago and still no action , a worthless piece of paper . "
Easier laws for owners. Tenant can give two weeks but the owner has to give 2 months
"Real Estate agents doing their jobs properly: correct paperwork, including attachments mentioned in emails but not included, following up quickly on maintenance."
"Disclosure at the start about all costs.  Water, solar and gas.  
Disclosure about property.  Safety features, school zone, and what maintenance issues are outstanding and when they will be addressed"
To allow pets such cats and dogs to be with their owners
"Owners need greater protection from ""tenants from hell"" and courts should support owners who suffer at the hands of bad tenants"
"“Fair wear and tear”. This causes huge issues when leaving a property and often bonds are kept for months after you have moved out while the realtor tries to claim huge amounts for small and generalised issues. Furthermore, renters generally have to have the next bond and the next set of rent ready for their new property, not to mention that there will also no doubt be some overlap where you are paying double rent. There is very little you can do as you are relying on that money to secure your new property."
"Lower rent, less inspections"
Fans and air con units should be standard in qld rental housing. 
"With our regional climate and ever rising rent prices in the city, owners need to be held to a minimum standard of house design and  keeping their house maintained to a minimum standard.

I lived in quite a small house in west end one time where during the warmer months the lack of natural ventillation left the house quite uncomfortable. Temperatures often reaching up to 40 degrees.
We approached the owner via the real estate and put forward the reasoning and justification for ceiling space whirlly birds, ceiling fans or an air conditioner but were not given a response. As it was not an emergency repair there was mandatory requirement to even provode a response.

I think there should be a minimum standard for natural ventillation requirements in lieu of conditioned air.

The same owner refused to replace the hot water system originally installed when the house was buolt over 40 years ago. We would constantly raiase repair requests when the units piolit light would fail to light. The unit was obvioualy at its end of life yet the owner refused to replace it.

Soon later the house was put up for sale and we left the house. The house went for sale for over 1.5 million. There was even an article in real estate .com about how the owner bought the house for $80K and spent close to nothing on upkeep and only one new coat of paint.

Long and short of it, renters need more rights."
The landlord  gives us 60 days notice. I would be happy with 30 days. A little unfair I only have to give 14 days???
Stronger regulations that benefit the landlord
Less routine inspections
"Too much power given to tenants who can stay in the rental, not pay rent and destroy the property. "
"Limit rent inspections to once a year for a tenant who has proven themselves as not likely to wreck the property. There is nothing more demoralizing than having to submit to the intrusion of a stuck up and rude property manager entering your home (yes it is my home) every three months. They poke their nose in cupboards, take a million photographs and manage to make you feel like something that should be scraped off the bottom of their shoe. Where I am currently they just let themselves in without even knocking. Unlock the door and barge in, how would they feel if I were to do that at their home?"
"email property owner/agent with concerns, rather than having to fill in breach notice for concern to be acted upon. Property inspections should be done with two people who hold blue cards and have police clearances "
"There the vacate without cause is used at the time of a new lease the landlord or agent needs to have a minimum time of 4weeks to confirm a new lease will not be issued.
My wife and myself were told 8 days prior to the end lease date our lease was not being renewed."
1. Every rental property should be allowed the consideration of having a small pet on application. And the renters responsibility to have pest control completed upon leaving rental property. 
Better tenants right rather then dictated by a real estate
Allow people to rent whom have pets much easier
"Better communication when different real estates take over property management during a lease. The tenant only gets a surprise, we are taking over, you need to pay us now notice generally on the day of take over. There should be a minimum notice time to the tenant before a different real estate takes over the management to what is listed on the lease. I would suggest at least 7 days notice prior to the change in payment details. "
Ability of tenant to speak out against malpractice of property manager without fear of retribution (affecting rental history)
"rental prices were too low. would like liked the price to have improved especially in Townsville.
"
A fair and practical balance between tenants rights and landlords rights
More power to terminate tenants
"Real estate agents who don't just hold on to information, but pass it through to the owners and take some responsibility for entry and exit reports. Instead of just stealing bond to fix things that were broken upon tenant entry"
"Less frequent house inspections, its an invasion of privacy and not needed for long term tennants."
Have longer rental periods and make it easier to advertise to and show the property to new tenants before existing ones vacate. Currently if current tenants say no opens or inspections there’s nothing we can do except wait for them to leave then try to pay holding costs in full until new tenant is found. 
"Need to allow pets at properties and also allow them inside. It’s hard to find appropriate places for pets, usually properties that allow pets are run down and do not provide adequate safety for pet. "
"Fair and equitable termination of lease notice by tenants, have the same time frames for tenants and landlords."
I am moving from my current rental because I was sick and tired of asking for repairs. I hate moving and it costs time and money to move. I have inspected a number of properties and the conditions that the real estate agents show these houses are horrible. I am paying good money to rent a house I should be able to walk into the house and not hear a leaking tap.
I think managing agents should have stronger guielines to adhere to when managing a property on behalf of an owner.
Equal notice period of one month for either a landlord or tenant to end a tenancy.
Landlords need to be more diligent in keeping rental property in good repair
"Property managers would not be allowed to enter premises without tenants present or by prior arrangement (except in emergencies). Routine inspections could be booked via an online booking system, so the property manager still gets to pick suitable times. If the tenant doesn't book an inspection by a cutoff date then the current notice of entry rules would apply."
Fairness to both renters and landlords 
Landlords bully tenants. Real state agents don’t take care of tenants. 
Make sure that owners/real estates MUST maintain the property to a safe standard and that they MUST fix major faults that could cause health problems.
I am a landlord and a tenant totally trashed my place... QCAT found in my favour but I am still trying to get back the $9000 my previous tenant owes me after over two years
"Property managers show little care
Hard to maintain own property"
"The lack of communication from the Real Estate Agent when things change i.e. payment options - notified on Wednesday that the current payment option is no longer available.  Rent due on Friday.  Received email advising that even though they know this change is not the tenants fault they will be chasing for arrears on Monday.  

When advising of maintenance to the property - have to report issue more then once and in the end give up and fix the issues myself.  Waited 2 years for agent to fix leak in ceiling and you can still tell where the leak happened.  Took agent 9 months to stop the leak and then another 15 months to fix the ceiling. 

I have two bathrooms and if one isn't working then they take their time to organise a fix because I have two bathrooms.  I do not pay rent for a bathroom to be unavailable for a week.  I pay rent for two working bathrooms.  No real concern shown for the tenants wellbeing especially when its a toilet that isn't working. "
I would have set satisfied until I moved into a new apartment in Sept 2018 which has made me chose Dissatisfied.
"I think it is in the owners favour, and the property managers favour as well. We have also had terrible experiences when trying to get our bond back. There are little to no consequences when an owner or property manager enters the property without appropriate notice periods, unless the tenant decides to escalate this (usually after it has happened a number of times)."
"Standardise practices for real estate agents, allowing renters to have a fair and honest experience. "
Make it easier to get of tenants that get behind in the rent or damage a propety
Clarity around tenant and owner responsibilities. eg light bulbs at a new lease that aren't working
"More Honest real estate agents, non threatening,"
Tenants who trash a rental do not have to pay the costs for repairs apart from losing their bond. This is not fair to property owners. 
Change discrimination against renters with pets.  There are so many properties on the Gold Coast that will not allow renters to have pets but owners of units are alowed to have pets?
From landlord's experience - tenants need to be more honest & have respect for property their rent.
"I would source a landlord who believes that a house is a HOME and not just an opportunity for investment, and who respects the needs of those who are forced to rent because of situations that are beyond their control i.e. unaffordable house prices, unavoidable changes in family circumstances and financial, business (work) or personal reasons. "
"Landlords have so much power over tenants it's ridiculous. I understand that not all tenants are good but the same goes for landlords. I've had a landlord take me all the way to the rental tribunal for damage to the ceiling. He refused to accept photos that I took of the ceiling when I moved in proving the damage was already there.  I won, but that was 4 months after I moved out.  I'm a good tenant and it took me 4 months to get my bond back because my landlord was unreasonable, how is that fair?"
Most families have pets...and most rentals won't allow them. I'd ask for rules put in place to make it possible to have pets.
Having the owner fix things quicker when they aren't safe. 
Notice periods for landlords and tenants being equalised.
I believe if 1 tenant is allowed an indoor pet the same rule should apply to all tenants in a unit complex.
To extend the requirement for house inspections by real estate agents from every 3 months to 6months if you are a long term tenant 
"Better noise restrictions within units i.e. loud banging, tv volumes etc "
"Tennants need to be able to break their lease easier. Leases are in favour of the Landlord, never the tennant. A fee of one months rent should be all it takes to break a lease. Circumstances change, and people can't predict the future. A landlord is allowed to put their house on the market and force the tenant to have inspections (which is a direct violation of private enjoyment) but there is no safeguard at all for the tennant. The only ""safeguard"" they say is that if the house sells, your lease stays in place. What if the house is on the maket for the entire length of lease? Tennants NEED to be able to have more RIGHTS and LESS FINANCIAL PUNISHMENT for lease breaking."
Allow pets in all rented homes.  It is so good for people to have pets
"Greater ability to force the owner to make repairs and do maintenance, without fear of getting my lease not renewed"
"I feel that Pensioners should be allowed an increase in the subsidy that they currently get.
I share rent with my career (who is also my older sister) and after paying my half of the rent there is very little left for the kind of food that I need to buy and I often go a fortnight without buying any food. This means that I have to consume food that is not suited to my needs. I am a Type II Diabetic."
I think there should be more ways for a tenant to break a lease without being so heavily penalised. If they are facing financial stress they shouldn't have to choose between staying somewhere they can't afford or breaking a lease and paying massive fees. On top of also having to find a new tenant for the property that the real estate has to approve.
We were not able to use the bond $ to repair things the tenant had damaged during their stay without taking to small claims court.
"Allow landlords more rights to evict tenants who fail to pay, or do not keep the property is satisfactory conditions"
Agents - set times and dates that fit into their schedule then cancel when no-one books into session as opposed to the UK where the viewings are made to suit the tenant. I never had to take time off work to view in the UK
"Tenants need to have more rights, we get treated like garbage. I have moved into three different properties and after less than 12 months the properties have been put up for sale. It is an invasion of privacy when agents bring people through the property.You also get so say in what time agents bring people to look and the fact that they can come in with their keys at anytime without your permission isnt fair at all. Its very invasive and frustrating. So sick of being in this position. Owners cant sell their properties so put them up for rent then re list them for sale less than 12 months later. I am in this position again at the moment and I just hate it. Also tenants in this position should automatically get their bonds back as we need that money so we can find another place to live. Its such an inconvenience and very stressful having to find all that money again and moving money as well."
Harsher penalties for people who damage properties.
Allowing pets in rentals 
"No photos during inspection - they are a violation of privacy
No inspections without tenants present - an invasion of privacy"

To have tenants connect their own water services so there is no argument on water bills.
Quicker response for maintenance requests. Reward/acknowledgement for 'great tenancy renters'. Same level/standard of clean between all agents.
Solar Power and Energy Devices
 The real Estate agents must improve the service! Attention to request for repairs within the rental property reported by the renter! Many good renters are disillusioned and frustrated when a major component ( kitchen stove or air conditioner are not functioning at all! Yet the agents are ignoring this and asking for a higher price of rental.
The tenants agreement is a utter joke sign a 12 month lease owner wants the house back asked to vacate only offered 4 weeks rent that will either cover moving cost not taking into account having to find bond total unfair if tenant breaks lease have to pay rent and advertising till re rented 
Keep landlord out of the house when u do handover back to the real estate when u leave as the house will not be in the same look as it was when they lived in there is called lived in 
long term leasing would reduce a lot of stress and make life mucg easier and happier. stability is important.

More responsibility on agents to communicate promptly. 
Speed up the process it takes too long to find out if you are to get the property you are interested in
I think that all rental properties should allow pets. 
Have a way for tenants to rate properties and the owner/management so other tenants know what their actually going into

"The people who l am renting from Horzion and I do live in a housing comision block and we live on the ground floor of this place and we need to get some things done like security cameras around here as we’re getting a lot of people coming into our block and they are looking around to see what they can steal and because we have 2 blocks on the same block of land the other people that live in the other building they have security fly doors and we’re not allowed to get them. 
My Landlord has the keys to my unit and they will give them to anyone that is going to be doing so work inside of the unit and you never know what they are doing and they take pictures of everything that is in your unit so I don’t like that at all and they work out the rent and take the rent money to help you pay them the extra money. "
"Agents have far too much power and are far too intrusive. Quarterly inspections is too often, only two weeks notice of when they're coming, at a time convenient to them, and no negotiation - just 'we're coming at this time'. I don't want people in my home without my being there, and they shouldn't have that right. Multiple things that needed to be fixed when I moved in haven't been, and a number of them won't be... there's nothing I can do about it. Also the rental application forms in Queensland are far too intrusive. One asked for 6 references, specified that they had to include parents and employer... all of them asked if I smoked, and bizarrely (given the supposed right to quiet enjoyment of the property), my lease bans anyone smoking in the property. "
Tenants that don't pay outstanding debt should be placed on TICA until they make some attempt to pay it off
Make them pet friendly
Having more legislation for landlords as tenants seem to have way to much flexibility with the property. 
"To be housed in a dept of housing home or be able to get accepted for a private rental on a disability pension.
I have to share with strangers since my children grew up and moved out after renting by myself for 30 yrs. I hate it. Im forever asking for help with power and they constantly pay rent late so i get a bad reference next time i need to apply for a home. It stinks. "
Every inspection I am expected to do something that is not required on a routine inspection. Windows to be cleaned when this is an out going requirement. I have been in the property for almost 5 years and live in an area that is dusty. I have a dog that runs a great deal and was on the lease. Am consistently told to renew the grass ? Inspections are never on time. I went for 9 months without an inspection then next one they cancelled but I took an annual leave day and was told 5 mins before inspection it was cancelled
my properties that allow animals. bigger homes with smaller rents
More balanced rules between tenants and landlords
"A schedule for rents to make it affordable because at the moment it is demarned based which I understand but landlords seem to only want short term agreements eg 6 months.which means they can put up the rents and there is no security for the tenant. You could say, well just move but due to cost, this sometimes not a choice. If your lease says maintain the gardens they the landlord and the tenant should half the water cost instead of the tenant having 100% of the cost. Sorry for adding two but both are important to me."
shorter wait times to process breaches
More affordable rental properties across the state
Being able to make minor modifications without permission
"You should be able to break your lease if you need to relocate to another town, without fees. "
Rental agents. They need to be the same ones throughout your years renting in the same house. I have had a few and now that i have left that house they are bringing up things that were on the entry report for me to fix
More accomplished available in some areas ie Noosa where demand on rental accommodation is high for hospitality workers. 
Improve legislation to enable an increase in accountabilily for real estate agents that are not doing their job.
Tenants should be required to provide receipt of professional carpet cleaning & pest control upon vacating if agent/landlord is able to provide proof by receipt that it was completed professionally before they moved in
Tenants expectations to treat a house however they like without any respect to the fact it is not theirs.
"I would like to see increased protection for the landlord. Currently the system favors the tenant and this is unjust. Landlords should have the ability to terminate a tenancy at any stage by giving 60 days notice, without grounds."
I would change the fact that the real estates should not be allowed to just be able to breach a tennant for anything they please unless it is within a very good reason 
"The real estate is given to much power,  I have had experience where I have been breached because the real estate has not communicated with me, taking 6 weeks to send me back details after they failed to activate a direct debit form I had signed and submitted. I now have a mark against my name and am having trouble getting a rental property."
The renting experience was great until we moved out and the on site managers / agent were finding any excuse to not refund our bond. Even when we hired and paid for a bond cleaner that THEY HAD RECCOMMENDED! 
agent able to refuse too high expectations of owner
"As a landlord, it becomes costly with rogue tennants, there is No assistance from governments with low income earners and Government costs (Mainly Queensland state government) are sky-rocketing. "
Significantly increase notification periods of particular events. eg. inspections. annual fire alarm checks etc. Provide the ability to reorganise those events if the do not suit. Rather then being forced at the time of their choosing.
when a tenant leaves a rental property we have to show receipts for carpet & pest control but the owner doesn't have to show the tenant documents that carpet & pest control was done before we move in
"That property managers get things fixed ASAP when they stop working (aircon, washing machine, fridge ect.) instead of doing nothing for 3 weeks while tenants suffer"
Get some maintenance done on our property when we ask for it; be able to move when we ask for it with one month's notice.
"Bond should be increased from 4 weeks to 6 weeks. If tenant fails to pay rent, even if given notice after 2 weeks, they may not pay at all by termination date and full 4 weeks currently allowed covers only unpaid rent, leaving nothing for claims in relation to repairs, etc. This then means the landlord needs to make a separate claim to get full reimbursement."
"Introduction of a nationl/state tenancy register to record tenants' renting history,  and assist landlord/agents with evaluation of prospective tenants based, among other things, on their rental history."
"Being able to report dangerous housing that is falling apart without having to go to court. I've lived in houses with holes in the floor (raised house!) that they wont fix and we could only break lease and leave - so now years later other people are living with the same dangerous issues. 

We currently have a 3 meter drop out of a window around 50cm off the floor and it's not safe for my 20month old (no screens, just open window) - yet again we cant do anything as it is a house (and if we want screens we must pay). Sometimes we dont want to break lease and leave - we would prefer the issue fixed or house unsafe to live in.
I'm thankful however we have had the option to put in screens, I've had mouldy toilets in share houses, owner turning up to the property whenever he wanted, ovens not being replaced when broken - only option for us was to leave or go to court - there needs to be another option especially as the real estate wouldn't do anything."
"Sorry, three thing actually:
1. Get everything in writing. We had six months contract. The agent requested we sign a twelve month contract, and we would be able to leave when we wished without charge. We finally got enough deposit for a home, and a bank  that would approve a homes loan, but they still wanted four-weeks' notice even though we had a tenant ready to move in the next day who had been acceptable to a namesake agent in another town. It was not fair to expect the agent to deduct funds from our bond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2. As we had no issues with keeping house clean, we should not have needed to have three-monthly inspections.
3. Landlord should have covered extra treatments during the year for insect infestations when required."
"Lower rent for longer term renters, government supported options to rent to buy

"Ensuring that property maintenance is performed when needed, allowing pets with a pet bond, less discrimination towards tenants when looking for properties, more affordable housing"
To have repairs done quickly to property when needed and not have to wait months for work to be done
More incentive for owners to allow tenants to have pets.
Being allowed to paint walls if necessary and change carpets without waiting for okay as long as it's neutral based
better screening of applicants
"Allow renters to treat the home as their own and fix problems when they arise, do regular maintenance. We lived in a two story the had gutters full of moss and mould, it took 2 years for the owners to clean it - we were told it was dangerous to be living there. This is only one of our storys…
I would change the amount of time inspections are done - we have regular real estate inspections plus owner inspections. When the owners come threw they treat it like its there place, get a drink, breast feed, bring their kids and jump on our beds..."
"1. Maintenance issues

2. Applications issues"
"Affordable, stable living arrangements.  I have been having to move every year for the last 5 years due to properties being sold.  This situation had led to my health to further deteriorate in the last couple of years."
"I know that even though I pay private rent. I have rights I fully understand that. However, if the owner doesn't live where you pay rent but the owner's Father also lives their and believes he owns the place and goes around changing things like, I had a shed key because my belongs that don't fit in the house are boxed and I need access to my belongs but the owners Father has changed the lock on the shed and I no longer have access to my own belongs. I feel as if I am a prisoner in my own area. Not only do I not have access to my own belongs, simply because this owner's Father believes their is a thief who is steeling his tools. I don't want his shit and I am a women and why would I steal tools (hello). But I have boer witness to him leaving the shed door open for over a week.........
 other 
Anyway their are other issues like the Father is jimming the electricity box to run another box to his section where he sleeps to control what is being used. He also has jimmied the hot water system. I am over his shit and I can't wait to move out. My only concern is my rental history before moving into here, but I have not long come off Austudy and put back onto Newstart because I am still completing my degree - Bachelor of Counselling. I would love to move out I just don't know how at present.

Also things need fixing and they don't get fixed but that is the problem with private rent. I feel that one issue is if the owner put our rent into an account and only gets used for things that need fixing in the house and also goes towards electricity and water. Because our electricity and water are included where we live. Oh and our rent has been raised $10 a week. but nothing gets done."
"As an owner of more than 1 property, I currently do not allow pets and I want to keep that option."
Having more guidelines around who is allowed to stay in the home. 
Safety- having owners actually fix issues.
"contract circumstance, able to break without penalties "
Commitment by landlord to have the property as a long term rental.  On 3 separate occasions we had to move house with the minimum 2 months notice before the end of the contract because the landlord wanted the property back to sell it.  Should be some sore to system where the property is guaranteed to be a rental property for at least 5 years.  If it gets sold it should be sold as a rental.

authority for property managers to engage urgent repairs 
I think tenants have to be responsible for there maintaining if units/ houses they need to be held accountable for bills they accumulate and rent been paid after they vacate 
To be allowed to have pets at the house.  After renting the same property for 2 years change inspections to 6 monthly instead of 3 months.  I keep a tidy house but so stressful having it like a show home every 3 months
Ability to save for a house deposit and no longer rent
"tenants rights. 
real estate agents made accountable for their incompetence. 
regular maintenance procedures "
Ensure bad tenants can be evicted quickly
Being able to have pets and find accommodation that isn’t horrible and falling apart but super expensive that I can provide a safe home for myself and my cats 
"Landlord blacklist or database just like the one that exists for tenant names.  Landlords destroy quality of life for vulnerable families and individuals.  Eg retribution for expecting them to meet their obligations and standards in regulations and laws.  Fail to make repairs, do maintenance, allowing houses to get rundown.  Vulnerable tenants are poor and can not afford to move all the time or for no good reason, particularly impacts children when landlords play power games.  I am extremely good tenant with excellent rental references but have 3 times been abused in this way by landlords."
"There should be more options to reserect maintenance other than a breach lease, when it complys to health issuesand property damages"
As a landlord current rules provide fair framework for both parties 
"With my tenancy experience, my realtor ignores my calls and emails and fails to update me on repair requests that are more than 17 months old now. There needs to be stricter guidelines for owners/property managers who do not uphold their obligations. "
"Real estates generally put renters low on their list of priorities, it doesn’t seem to make any difference how good a tenant you are, we are just all treated like a bit of dirt"
Remove real estates from the equation
Instability of the housing market
The rising of rent when work or repairs are not done.
Housing stability. Knowing that my housing will be both available abd affordable for as long as I need it. 
Property Manager are the new sleazy car salesmen from the 80s. Absolutely disgusting behavior and dodgy as hell. Some of them should not be trading or be in business. They are facilitated by the ridiculous Government Agencies processes
"balance interest of tenants and owners better

More pet friendly properties. 
"more security, CCTV survalnce in all community car parks that do not have a carport or garage ."
"5enants should be able to choose to move to a periodical tenancy when the lease term completes, rather than being forced to make a ""renew vs vacate"" choice."
"Often problems are not found until after the 3 days allowed for the entry report. Also I have found agents don’t always check the condition of the place prior to leasing, "
Tenants should be required to provide receipt that professional carpet cleaning and pest control has been completed upon vacating provided there is evidence in the form of a receipt that it was completed before they moved in
Notice to leave without reason should be illegal
Rent assistance needs to go directly to the managing agency. Tenants receive rent assistance but still not pay rent.
"Freedom to have pets.
Freedom to hang stuff on walls.
No inspection of property during the lease as it is my private space and the inspection should only occur at the end of the lease (the bond exists for the purpose of damage done to the property)."
"To prevent dodgy landlords renting below standard properties at exorbitant prices, there should be a register of properties. 
The properties should be inspected on a regular basis, eg; annually. If the property is not up to code or meets a minimum standard, the owners are given a certain amount of time to remedy the code/standard, during which time tennants have reduced or no rent depending on issue, if the code/standard is not attended to within a certain amount of time then the property cannot be rented until it is fixed."
"Searchable list of owners/ agents that have had complaints against them- remedy to breach, ombudsman."
As an owner of a property we require more immediate action when a tenant has not moved at the end of a fixed term lease. I have known other owners to lose their property as the rent pays the bank payments and when a tenant stops paying rent but won't move as they are aware of the time it takes to take action and Magistrates have allowed a tenant to remain for extra time (still no rental payment). I think if the owners has done the correct thing the tenant should be made to follow the rules as well.
Allowing pets in all residences. It is fine that enabling this would be subject to certain conditions set by the landlord. However there must be more freedom in allowing tenants to have their own pets. Way way too many pets are given up because tenants cannot have them with their new lease agreements. It’s sad. And needs to stop. People have a right to own a pet. 
Non ignorant Real Estate Agents. 
Pets should always be allowed. 
Be able to feel like the properties are more like a home to us. For responsible and respectable tenants to be treated better by the owners and real estates. 
"Real estate agents discourage long term rentals. Agents try to get tenants on short leases of 6 months and upon each renewal seek to increase the rent by $20 'due to market conditions and the instructions of the landlord'. This occurs regardless of 'market conditions' and occurred despite drop in property values between 2009 - 2015 and low interest rates. Unless people feel capable of negotiating, they wear the increase. That adds up quickly and forces people to have to move and potentially disrupt schooling, work etc. "
"Bond must be two weeks not one month. This will help tenants when they have to move from a place to another especially when they are force to. 
If the house is not cleaned by a professional, real estate agency or landlord must also took in consideration that it can be well done. Today, tenants have the feeling they HAVE ask to a professionals otherwise they will lose part of their bond."
"Realestate agencies are more interested in selling houses then letting houses, can be very difficult to organise inspection times around work."
"Most of the problems we've faced as tenants, we think, can be attributed to the particular property manager we had for a time. But the thing we'd like to change if we could, concerns when a rental property sells. The unit we have rented for the past 2 years and 6 months has been up for sale for a period of close to a year if the three separate occasions are all added together. Now our property has been sold according to real estate.com, but the property manager has not provided any notification to us. A former selling agent (not the one at the time the property sold) did though call us and tell us that the buyer wants to move in - we find it concerning that neither the rental agent nor the selling agent have informed us about this. Our lease finishes at the end of February (3.5 months after the property has 'sold'). Effectively, we are being asked to leave - we understand that comes with the territory of renting, but it is an inconvenience. Allowing the tenant some flexibility in such circumstances to move at a time that is convenient to them could help to ease some of that burden and disruption. We think that once a property sells, then it should be that the tenants can leave the property - with 4 weeks notice, for example - any time up to when the lease finishes without penalty for breaking the lease. That gives them the best chance to find a replacement home in a location, for a price and at a time that is suitable for them - something slightly in their favour in for a change. "
"'Improved access for tenants to: 
-Consult with the property owner to contribute to property (eg: adding new shelves etc.) 
-Be on a flexible lease after the initial period (eg: after initial 6-12month lease, the tenant can leave with only 2 weeks notice) 
-Being able to keep pets without permission. If the pets damage the property, the tenants should be liable, just like any other damage caused by tenants. As a property owner as well as a tenant this makes sense to me! 
-Legally rent spaces for Tiny houses in backyards etc. I think this was reviewed recently so may not be relevant. 
-Use unit common areas for gardening and growing fresh vegetables and herbs. This would benefit health and well being through fresh produce and also could improve mental health. 
-Improved building standards for balcony drainage and containment, so that units underneath others don’t receive water and debris from above. I received a warning letter from the property manager because of watering my plants and water running onto the balcony beneath. How is this a thing? 

For tenants, property owners and the energy grid: 
Being able to install solar panels, batteries or better access renewable energy. 
This could possibly be achieved with a an energy contract between tenant and owner, instead of paying the energy retailer directly. 
I own a tenanted property in NSW and it is hard to justify installing solar panels since, as the owner, I cannot on-sell electricity to recoup investment costs. Changing the ability to manage, buy and sell electricity would be beneficial for owners and tenants. Tenants could receive cheaper, renewable energy and owners could gain additional revenue on their property while adding renewable energy capacity. Furthermore, this could also benefit the grid if a smart energy systems are used with battery storage and appropriate timing of energy usage. Homes with battery storage could supply the grid instantly if it was required in peak times and this could benefit the stability and help to flatten price spikes on the grid, having benefits for the entire state and beyond. "
Long term security
"Reign in fraudulent real estates that are steeling from young inexperienced tenants. Put a rent cap on all rentals.
Make landlords fix their houses within timeframes or forfeit rent until they do."
Restriciting landlords to raising rent when a town temporary booms. 
"Allow long term tenants to make changes to the house/property.
Eg. Remove trees from the yard; install picture hooks; install A/C units etc"
"I think the biggest problem is the pet clause, we need to make it that all properties allow pets within reason, understandably they couldn’t have a horse if it was a unit or apartment. 
Also real estates need to be more flexible to people who are on Centrelink, as being on disability payments and not being able to work my income sometimes isn’t sufficient"
landlords expections need to be to a satisfactory standard and they also need more education regarding their investment and the renting process. 
To be able to have a small pet inside my rental property with my impeccable references that I have from both a previous landlord who I rented privately and references from the Cattery in Toowoomba where my late Charlie Brown stayed with whenever I was away visiting friends and family and also when I was diagnosed with brain cancer on the 08/080/2014.
Communication and action from rental agency
The managing agent is the key to all of this. There needs to be more srutiny with them.
"Tenant's have too many rights, and make being an investment property owner very challenging and sometimes wondering why we bother."
Being able to request home improvements/maintenance without fear of rent payment increases.
"Being able to decorate our apartment. Per our lease we cannot put anything on the walls. No pictures, nothing. It is hard to look at blank white walls for years. And only so much can be done with placing art on furniture. 
Better standard or maybe just standards to define normal wear and tear. "
I'm not in agreeance with paying water. I don't mind paying for what I use but I am being charged a proportion of the owners basic water charge as well
Make the process simpler and more transparent for both landlords and tenants 
Better qualified real estate agents and a limit on how many properties each agent can manage
More thorough information provided about tenants rental history including previous inspection reports.
"Rental prices are too high with respect to housing prices, and when housing prices fall, rental prices stay the same, thus not reflective of the market."
Landlord bond to allow property managers to immediately action repairs rather than waiting for landlord's to save up. Also increases likelihood that potential investors will consider the expenses of managing an investment property beyond loan repayments.
Improvement in ensuring tenants payback unpaid rent.  Ensure at the minimum a locked in payment plan 
I would like the property owner to declare if there is any asbestos on the property that will be worked on during the lease. I rented at 6/6 Lisbon Street Maroochydore and wasn't told this was going to happen. They removed the asbestos putting several cracks in the ceiling and replacing the guttering where I had left the window open previously meaning that I could have been exposed. They have not replaced the cracked asbestos on the landing. Just disgraceful. If a child plays on that area they may get very sick.
"Only deal with one property manager and if the is a change, notify the tenant.
I had three property managers in two years. Wasn't quite sure of who I was meant to be dealing with."
"Having to clean up the previous tenants filth,as I'm sure the agent wouldn't want to live like we had to when we first moved in."
"house needs to be updated - solar battery system, new a/cs"
Government incentives for solar power on rentals
"Real estate agencies need to be policed heavier and more frequently, most are criminals. Repairs need to be paid more attention also."
Do not tell the real estate that I am a pensioner
Being able to have pets on the property. Ticking yes to pets on a rental application form means it goes straight to the bottom of the pile.
"The standard of properties are incredibly poor. I'm a property manager, tenant and landlord of my own investment property - the condition landlords are allowed to lease properties and the expectations they hold is appalling. As both a tenant, property manager and landlord of my own investment property I feel there needs to be tougher legislation on the minimum requirements for someone to be able to provide a property for lease - there is too much concern over cost for most landlords to provide the correct amount of upkeep. "
"The constant fear of being kicked out if you speak up about owners who interfer with your quiet time and enjoyment. A serial breach artist, a notice to remedy breach would be more than familiar to this man, and bo deterrant at all"
"More freedom and flexibility for tenants.  Realistic rental prices and the ability to renovate, paint etc with agreement with owner "
"Rental property managers have too much power and can make renting very difficult.
They can ignore your issues and trying to get help above them is useless"
Give more control to the tenants as in letting us use trades we know instead of the owner coming to “fix” things.  
"Remove the real estate agent's ability to use notice to vacate (Form 12) as a way to get tenants to sign a lease renewal.

My real estate would send me a notice to vacate 3 months before my lease ended along with a lease renewal saying the notice to vacate would be rescinded once I signed the lease renewal. This behaviour is predatory, not what the notice to vacate is designed for, and completely defeats the purpose of the tenant having a longer period to evaluate their options - particularly when there are significant rent increases as part of the renewal."
"Have access to a simple description of the rights and responsibilities of:
The Tenant
The Property Owner
The Rental Agent"
HAVING A LONGER LEASE PERIOD
Tighter governance around renting agencies.
I wish lessors were not able to force tenants to use rent payment schemes like Rental Rewards. These cost the tenant money and only benefit the letter agent. 
The whole PAMDA act needs to be reviewed. Making landlords fully accountable for repairs to be done in a timely fashion and property managers need to be the ones to approve urgent and necessary repairs.
"Managing agents being held accountable for poor service.
Tenants should be given a rating, 10 if they have looked after a property down to 1 if they have not. To make them more responsible."
"Less inspections after proving that you’re a good tenant e.g. inspections only allowed every 6 months after the first 12 months of lease. 

"
Maintenance getting done in a timely matter
More pet friendly homes. 
Improve property management groups.
The lack of urgency real estate have once your in the property. They don’t respond well to any defects in the house that requires maintance.
I'd like the managing agent to be more responsive to repair issues.
More rights for landlords when tenants default or damage property.
"Allowing tenants to have pets, however a set number of pets on one property. 
Have an independent body to inspect the safety of the premises to ensure repairs are being completed. Inspection should be yearly for safety.
Receipts for rental payments.  
Timeframe on repairs."
"Real estate agents and owners unfairly and unjustly treating renters. Every property I have rented I have experienced issues agents and owners neglecting to fix things, even urgent things like water leaks and safety issues. "
"Disallowing schemes such as DEFT or changing the rules around how rent is allowed to be paid. 

Rental agents are always trying to get tennents to sign up to expensive payment schemes such as DEFT and allowing them to offer impractical or expensive alternatives reduces my bargaining power as a renter to refuse. Cheques are an obsolete and expensive way to pay regularly and shouldn't be a standard option as a way to pay rent. Also EFTPOS and credit card are practically the same and shouldn't be seperate entries. These niche or expensive impractical alternatives are always first choice of agents when I refuse to use rental payment systems leaving me with no option of paying rent without having to pay fees for the privilege."
More notice provided to owners for tenants not to renew a lease (I think it’s only 2 weeks for tenants to notify landlords).
I would make the application and approval process easier. I feel like a second class citizen giving them all my personal information. It is so difficult to find a suitable house that is available at the right time due to restrictions on giving notice. You are then forced to pay more weeks rent to secure the property and then punished for breaking a lease due to housing availability. 
"Move to property leasing arrangements, as per many other parts of the world that allow a leased house to feel more like a home."
Improve opportunities for longer term tenancies.
"Pets should be aloud as long as they aren't making a mess or ruining the house,  also respecting the tenants privacy a bit more,  the real-estate I am through gives electricians and plumbers etc, keys to just enter the house, they don't organise a time or day with us,  often the electrician or plumber does not even ring before they come. "
"As an owner who rents out my property, I feel that the tenants have sufficient rights and legal backing as the laws stand now. It is difficult enough to remove a tenant who defaults on his rent, abuses your property and is disruptive to the neighbourhood now, without making it more difficult with new laws."
More accountability on tenants. The system is geared towards tenants to protect them from agents who over penalise. More balance required.
"More equality between landlord and tenant rights and notice provisions. For example, in is inequitable that a landlord is required to give 2 months notice when and tenant requires 2 weeks notice. Landlords are often more stretched financially than tenants, which is not a fact recognised by policy makers. As both vacancy rates and interest rates rise this cycle, this is something to not lose sight of."
"have had a good experience. Although Discrepencies in how the cleanliness/condition of a house is assessed before/after rental is inconsistent and can cause problems - e.g a small hole in gauze not noticed/worried about on entry, but charged to tenant on exit."
Maintain the current tenancy agreement arrangements between Tenant & Landlord
"Improved communication from real estate agent and body corporate. As an interstate owner we have had problems with real estate agent not having information from the body corporate, by the time the information came to us their was a a lengthy delay "
"I would love to be able to make the property feel more like a home,   By being allowed to have a pet and hang things on the walls."
"More comprehensive communication with land lords/owners, not just overwhelmed property managers or their assistants. I’d like to be able to give feedback about the quality of the property managers to the owner who is paying them. "
Nothing. our tenants and property manager have been great 
"More protection for tenants, a limit to rental increases, longer notice in case of contract ending, fairer rent"
Improve the communication from real estate agents regarding any issues renters have with the property 
Standardize rental reference data
The price of rentals and upkeep of property
With technology today . When a contract is written to have possible contact with tenant and owner. I trusted the agent they let me down .
Stronger accountability for letting estate agency on reporting property condition.
"Better conditions given by the landlord (access to a green waste bin, better rules around pets and breaking leases)"
Ceasing 'vacant possession' when landlords sell properties.
"How easy is it is for tenants to walk out of a property with rent in arrears, damages, mess and everything else the landlord and/or associated parties are left to deal with."
Not needing to declare you own pets when applying to avoid discrimination on this basis
"Ability to lengthen time between inspections for long-term tenants
More pet-friendly rentals"
"Tenants be expected to assume more responsibility when renting. For example, tenants often flout terms of the lease agreement (such as keeping pets, smoking in the house, putting holes in walls, etc.) with impunity. Landlords generally have little power to prevent these breaches as agents will not act on them. Many tenants also stop paying rent some weeks before their lease is up so that the outstanding rental payments consume the bond. Other damage, cleaning, etc. to the property must then be provided for from the landlord's pocket."
Rental properties more accepting of pets - especially large dogs. 
the paperwork is endless and not consistent across agencies
"should be a standard POINT system for ID for example a Birth Certificate should be 50 or whatever amount it should be worth the same points across ALL Real-estate Agent.
Not worth 50 at one real-estate and then 20 at another real-estate and then 70 somewhere else

A Drivers licence again should be worth the same ID points across QLD real-estate agents"
"Honest property manager for the owner/investor, inspections quarterly instead if six monthly."
Make it easier for tenants to make a formal complaint without having to go to court to rectify issues
Being able to transfer bond money to a new property when moving
It would be good to know about the rights as tenants and I believe all tenants should be provided with Tenats QLD contact details as part of the signing of Lease agreement.
"When tenants sign a tenancy agreement they must be held responsible for this, not just opt out when they feel like it and leave without paying the rent.  The bond should be increased to cover 8 weeks rent and therefore be used should the tenant just up and leave."
"More safeguards for investors against tenant damage so that, should a tenant damage the property in any way, they (the tenants) be made responsible for the repairs which they caused. "
Allow pets without permission from the landlord.
"Feeling like it is actually my home, and not that my purpose their is to pay rent only "
More renting residentials for retirees 
Less inspections and more flexibility/rights to protect tenants quiet enjoyment of their rental property.
More rental properties available to those with pets and also more assistance for those with a disability.
Agents and/or landlords should remember that tenants are people who just want a home. They should not continuously be made to beg for regular maintenance to be performed. Further they should not be made to feel like second class citizens and feel continuously bullied. Landlords should treat their asset as an investment and run it like a business
"Regardless of what the rules actually are, in practice, real estate agents and property owners have more power than renters do. In my experience, too many agents and owners get away with abusing that power. Renters often put up with a lot because of a lack of faith that the system will defend their rights. Bad feedback, whether deserved or not, has more of an impact on a renter's future housing prospects than bad feedback to an agent does. A complaint won't put an agent or owner out of business, but a bad reference will stop a renter from finding a home. I have been a renter for 18 years, I have a good track record, but I have come across some of the most deplorable behaviour from agents in that time, that I still have a fear of confronting them - simply because the power is in their hands, not mine. And they know it. Is this part of the culture of the industry? I don't know, but it shouldn't be like this.

Tenants should be able to use the property they're renting as their home. eg. pets. Only tenants with a bad track record should be barred from keeping a pet."
"Free option to pay bond loan in instalments for all properties, or income levels"
I live in Mackay and have never lived in a house that was under 8years old but the real estate wanted house back to brand new condition upon vacate 
Bring the prices down and give a chance to to new migrant families starting out especially if you have good reference on them
stronger disclosure requirements on tenants.
The ability to make the rental property more like a home.
The house inspections - they make it feel like you aren't able to feel like it's a home for you to live in and should be showcase viewing. The stress especially on families is huge & when kids are sick you feel like no matter how much you clean it's not good enough! Also more allowances for people to own pets. It's sad reality denied to many. If we are seen as valuable tenants then some leeway should exist especially if we are willing to pay for any carpet treatments etc.
Agents reports are misleading and cover up damage.  Have been involved on both sides as renter and owner of a property renting it out.  Agents should have to wear costs when they dont manage the property properly and damage is incurred instead of trying to push it on on the renter or the owner.  If it is proven they are not up to standard they should be banned fro 6 months from being able to managae or lease properties.
"Faster approval method for tenants requests to make changes and for fixing requests to the home. As in a system that allows the renter to take a picture of the desired changes or create a written request that is sent directly to the owner of the home or the realtor as relevant. It would include who is paying for the materials, specialised labour (if any), and when it is required. An automated system will send it to the appropriate channel for approval and initiation. Urgent requests can also be submitted this way. It can also show when rent it paid up to, who the bond is currently in the name of, and any other important information. This system should only be accessible to the renter, the realtor, and the homeowner. Only established realty businesses should be allowed to use this system. It should not be a database for third parties to buy data from."
Pets allowed by default. More hooks in walls for pictures. 
Higher skilled property managers
Would like Tenants to care more for the garden/lawn
Allowance of pets by some kind of extra bond amount. Too many people are having to surrender pets because they cannot find a pet friendly rental in high occupancy areas.
Right to have cats / small dogs. 
Discrimination-they say the owner has to take the best applicant but the property manager makes their choice first
Give more power to landlords. Bond doesn't cover enough. Unfortunately the renter culture is largely not mine dont care.
Less rent prices 
"Property Managers. 
Not only do they need to work with the landlord when issue arise they also need to respect tenants. "
Allow pets in any house. They are part of the family and maybe a lot more dogs would be adopted. Ask for extra bond but it’s really hard to find a decent place that allows dogs.
"Fewer inspections, more obligations to repair issues, allow pets"
Nothing at this stage only been renting up here for 4 months
Strengthen the rights of tenants - real estate agents do NOT have the interests of tenants at heart when a tenanted property is put on the market for sale - they care only for the interests of property owners and have told us so point black repeatedly
"If a tenant is has not paid rent without any communication/explanation, how long you have to be able to evict someone."
Clearer rules and regulation with regard to tenant responsibilities. 
"It’s all in favour of the tenants, no matter what they do they have the rights, no matter how many breaches they re given it takes ages to get them out of a house.

Why should tenants have the right to stay in a house if the rent isn’t paid and numerous breaches have been given. Unfair on the owners"
Ability to make cosmetic changes to property and then make good at the end of the lease.
"The more flexibility when cross over time when moving from one rental to another.  I have paid up to 2 months of double rent when changing addresses.
Support to have pets also. "
"More security for tenants that their rent won't be raised, and that they won't be kicked out with short notice so that apartments can be built or for no given reason at all."
"1. Ensure period to give notice to vacate is balanced for both owners and tennants.
2. Restrict new developments in inner city suburbs as there is already an over supply.
"
"Allowing pets in apartments, allowing items to be hung on the walls"
"Allow pets. My dogs are my kids and they do less damage than 2 legged kids. I shouldn't be discriminated against.
Less invasive inspections. Final inspections done by a third party who is impartial. Inspections are so invasive. Many are so over the top. 3 or 6 month inspections treated like final inspections, expecting the house to be in show home condition, even checking the oven is just ridiculous."
"Have a database in which people can post reviews of both tenants and landlords (like Airbnb) to address issues from both sides. This will protect and reassure people. There are too many people out there taking advantage and leaving people in very vulnerable situations. 
I have had to go to the police in 2 cases for abusive and violent tenants and did not have any rights. You should not have to be scared or afraid in your own home - particularly being a woman. "
"Prompt action for maintenance issues increased. Eg. I went a whole week with no hot water, waiting for a new system to be put in place."
No house inspections without the tenant present.
More security of  tenants' tenancy.
Real eastate agents calling back 
Pets  being allowed for families and non discrimination  on children  in rentals 
More pets being accepted in rental properties 
"Shop around for a decent property manager. 
As an investment property owner we relied on the competence of our property manager, and have had a very stressful time and are set to lose a lot of money selling the place due to their incompetence. "
Having quality tenants who pay on time and do not damage property then want to have fixed immediately 
"I began renting in 1993 and have rented ever since then.   The only time I ever felt secure in my housing was when I rented with a co-operative in 1998 (i think,  ).  This helped me significantly to get my life together after being in a bad situation.   Now I am in a position where I work and have two children at home with me still,  I rent,  I struggle and I am not eligible for public housing.   If I was eligible I would I imagine be able to save a deposit and get a housing loan from the department of housing and purchase the house I was in.  This is the only option available to meto ever own a house /home.   I often wonder whether I would be wiser to give up working and go on the pension to have housing security for my kids and I.    It should not be this way and it is pathetic that this is how it is in Australia 2018.  Currently I rent privately,  almost fifty percent of my weekly pay.   And I could be asked to move by the owner at any stage, I had to move a few months ago as the owner sold the house.   It cost me two thousand dollars and I am still paying it off cause I certainlydon't  have savings.   It is not just the housing pressure that is causing me to live hand to mouth but it is a major factor in it.  I am crying as I write this cause this is how engulfing and upsetting the situation is and why I consider that not working would at least put me in a situation where I could be secure in my housing.   I have to be very careful about putting in maintenence reports because what if it is something expensive or makes them not want mevas a tenant anymore?  That is how scary it is and completely geared to the owner and his or her house not me and my family and our home.  I have not eve been able to hang one picture on the wall for over four years as there was no hooks and it wasn't allowed.  Sounds like a home doesn't it. "
"Enforcement procedures put in place to ensure that when court decisions are in favour of the landlord, they are enforced, instead of making the landlord continually having to re-enter the legal system to get what has already been decided, again and again."
Better laws governing the rights of both renters and landlords.  
Have agents complete mandatory training that covers relevant legislation and its application to rental accommodation. 
Yearly contracts after one year
Bond money should be able to be transferred to new owner.
"Require booklets that explain QLD tenancy rules be given to every tenant when they sign the initial lease on any property, as is done in Victoria. Require all private landlords to have read the booklet as well. The booklets should include clear guidelines on the rights and obligations of both landlord and tenant as well as QCAT procedure and alternative mediation suggestions."
Have managing agents be more thorough during inspections - look for holes in wall hidden behind furniture etc
having one consistent property manager
"If interest rates go down, it would be good if our rental went down."
Rents could be cheaper
Have properties advertised in advance for inspection to allow time to plan a move.
A better and more reliable tenant pool who are financially capable of meeting the rent payments and looking after house and garden.
More accountability for tenants and their actions.
"Knowing an up-front, fixed post-rental cleaning charge, rather than the danger of loosing your entire security deposit (needed for your next rental or house) through an unreasonable landlord."
Tenants should pay for water instead of landlord paying it then trying to get it out of the tenant.
It would be more fair to reduce the notice that landlords need to give tenants to vacate from two months down to one month or 6 weeks.
Make the tenancy agreement more flexible
This Direct debit pay system that has recently be inaugurated by Real estate agents. It is an invasion of privacy and is just a way for agents to cut staff and now we can not get hold of property managers when we need to. 
The 'cleanliness' expectations of the landlord or their agent when vacating.
Maintenance issues that are of no fault to the tenant. 
"The length of time given for renting, not terminating at the end of 12 months when I clearly stated longterm. "
"Make all Landlords Register Properties as being Habitable. Then if there are any complaint against the Land Lord Repairs and bringing the Property up to standard, will be mandatory within a set time. Failure to do so will allow Free Rental/ Loss of income to Landlord and a fine system for failure to comply. Both Financial and Prison sentences."
"Changes to the rules regarding raising rent - real estate agencies can avoid putting down a reason for constantly raising the rent my merely refusing any lease agreement longer than a year, thus every new year renting is a new agreement and therefore technically the rent hasn't been raised, it's just a new contract. They use this to just continually raise the price you pay until you're forced to move out."
Less frequent rental inspections for long-term tenants
Better communication with my property manager.
"The amount of inspections that are carried out.  I feel that if you have been a loyal and great tenant for a certain period of time then why would you need to conduct 3 monthly inspections, its invasive, too often when I've been living the same property for 8 years now with no blemishes.  Also why does it have to be a 2-3 hour window sorry but that's not appropriate either, i have to make meetings with clients and give a definitive timeframe, it should be the same with renting and agreed upon by both parties."
Allowing outside pets at all rental properties
Consistency between companies RE entry exit inspections and expectations 
Clearer rules around bond return 
Ability to hang photos and pictures on walls as long as holes are filled on exit
More rental properties open to pets.
"Ability to make small changes that enhance property without having to check with owner, through agent"
A tenant should be allowed to say that they always want to be in attendance if an owner or property manager wants inspect or attend the rental property.
"As a chronically ill person who cannot tolerate certain environmental pathogens, I need to be able to have a lease terminated if a property is making me ill, without going through a long process during which I am still exposed... especially if the illness is being caused by a known mould problem that was not disclosed to me by the agent at the time of signing a lease. The permanent physical damage that is done to people like me by a contaminated property can prevent the tenant from ever returning to work, or the life they had before exposure. Please consider the recent Parliamentary Inquiry into Biotoxin Related Illness while reviewing rental laws."
"As a renter  - satisfied with the process

As a landlord - the complexity and process to deal with problem tenants was painful and extremely legalistic. Landlord insurance is expensive and complicated."
improve minimum safety standards for homes
Real estate agents frequency of access
Real estates need to take a more active role in providing tenants with how to use standard equipment IE irrigation.
Real Estate needs to take a more active role in providing tenants with instructions on how to use std equipment supplied in the property.  Even if it means going through the supplied manuals.
The current laws do adequately support tenants and owners
"i think the rental property should have a better evaluation of prices, because the prices are too high for what is offered."
More accountability of owners/real estates to repair and maintain properties in a timely manner. More stability with longer leases and more pet friendly properties.
The proposed rules changes are crazy and not in favour of the owner.  I plan to sell all Qld property if they are passed and never invest in Qld property again...
"Better communication lines, fines for agents so they do their role effectively"
Properties allowing pets. It is difficult to find an affordable rental where pets are allowed including units and townhouses. 
Better response to repair and maintenance issues
Dishonest Real Estates who take your bond for bond cleaning and repairs that are not necessary. Dishonest Real Estates being able to take bond money with no communication with tenant.
It can be hard to get repairs or improvements done because landlords want to spend as little as possible and make a bigger profit. Understandable but can be frustrating as the property degrades and rent goes up. Even if you can find a better deal elsewhere it is so expensive and difficult to move it's not worth it. 
Put more restrictions on Real Estate Agents on what they can make the tenant do when they are vacating a property
"The cost of rent should be reduced if the landlord puts the property on the market.  It is unfair to constantly have to live your life in a fish bowl, and be expected to pay full rent at the same time.  It is the renter who is being inconvenienced with nothing for them to gain from it."
Less routine inspections.
Quality and regular communication regarding issues.
"Owners and rental agents treating tenants with mutual respect and laws and required actions to be in place and enforced without the tenants needing to be fearful of an eviction ""without grounds"" the owner and rental agent needs to provide a sufficient grounds for not continuing a tenacy and investigations be conducted into owners and rental agent taking advantage of vulnerable people."
Cheaper rent to single parents with children - ability to negotiate rent dependent on circumstances
"The 2 month clause about tenants being alowed to break signed leases if property goes on the market.
This is only here in favour of tenant not the owner who is taking financial responsibility for the property.
This is a silly rule when you consider the tenant may have only signed a 6 month lease and sale of properties especially to developers takes months (if not years) and most developers want to have tenants stay renting in property whilst they seek building approval etc.
What is an owner to do whilst waiting for a buyer?"
"People cleaning up their mess, as well as the mess from their pets."
Tighter rules around Real Estate being able to enter the property without my knowledge to show it to prospective buyers.
Better clarification on what the tennent and the owner are specifically entitled when an incident occurs. It is too open for individual interpretation.
affordable safe rental where low income can have a place to live . as the rental prices are going up and the welfare money is not . the judgement that realestate has on you if you are on welfare.
The RTA laws doesn't help tenants it is all about giving power to the owners and they abuse this over and over :(
That a single person can get a 2 bedroom place through public housing 
"Stricter control over the cost of rentals, the prices for some rentals far exceed what the average person can afford."
Landlords fixing things up when necessary such as broken locks and leaking ceilings.
I’m worried because my current tenant screams and yells a lot and seems abusive towards her small child. I don’t really know what to do. 
The real estates treatment towards you while you rent 
"Landlord tenants legal obligations seem imbalanced
Although there is the RTA, tenants are black marked if they are tactful and polite raising simple issues; plumbing, equipment malfunction etc 
I feel as if they would target me and I would eventually lose my lease. I have seen it happen to other tenants who had legitimate issues to raise. We aren’t trouble makers we are just raising issues.
What protections do I have.
It is so easy for landlords to manufacture information and make decisions around your place being not vacant to now the owners are considering selling...and then you move and then the owners change their minds.
We tenants need some fair protections. Can their be anonymous reporting and other strategies?"
Property owner obligations for basic maintenance such as pest control of the property. I've had experiences where I've let property managers / owners know of rodent / insect issues and they have been ignored.
"The Application process, and the various negatives that surround it. Renters are always loked down on as being inferior to property owners, and also the application process is stressful and lacks a level of fairness and control for propsective tennants, you always feel like your having to fight too much to find a suitable property, and i believe that comes down to the quality oif the property managers/agents  and how they handle the applictaion process, which is usually on the cheap because of time costs. this is better with agents who primarily are and have larger rental portfolios as their core business, but then it various on the internal culture of the agent a sto how they handle and treat tennants before and after taking up tennancys"
More dog friendly rentals available
"Less info to get in. Cheaper bond for those who look after houses,flats etc."
"1. My real estate agent makes me pay a fee for paying the rent via Bpay. I think that I should not have to pay a fee to pay my rent. The real estate agent can claim bank fees as a business expense and should not be charging tenants for this. 

2. I know you only asked for one but...
Reoccurring and ongoing 6 month leases should should not be allowed."
"Unable to make my rental a real home. No right to paint, hang pictures, etc. In addition, I feel like a ""bad kid"" (am a mature adult) if the rental is not PERFECT (a FEW weeds in the garden, etc.). I feel like my hard-earned money going to this not-so-cheap rental is worth nothing. I owe them everything, they owe me repairs, but that's it. No concern for comfort or anything. It always feels like I should be grateful to no limits for the privilege to stay in their rental, that they so graciously gave me. It's not pleasant to be a renter in Queensland. "
Better protection from having to move out if the owner decides to sell or move in as it is very costly to move house and most renters don't have spare money at short notice to move.
Ban Rockhampton City Council from charging landlords higher rates than owner occupiers. 
"Uncertainty around ""rules"" that are in place on a tenancy agreement that aren't a problem, in reality. Eg. ""No PETS"" often means ""Just ask, it's probably fine"" - but real estate agents tend to be cagey about answering those questions at an open house.

Additionally, making fixes or improvements seem to be disallowed by default (and I can understand the reason behind that), but often landlords don't want to spend a cent and fixing broken things myself is the only way it will get done. Eg. Landlord doesn't want to pay for re-siliconing around the bath, but the walls will rot if not done!

Similar to the gardens, I feel like we are restricted in what we can do to actually improve the gardens and make the place look nicer.

Generally real estate agents seem to take the approach of - ""if you haven't caused damage/decreased the value of the property/decreased the maintainability of the property, then all good"" but some stick to the letter of the rule for no good reason."
"Affordable rent would be best, currently all rent is over 50% of anyone's income. Rent is also goes up automatically every lease renewal making it harder to stay in a home. Cap the rental market! "
"The ability for landlords to receive more detailed and current information about the tenant's care and attention to the property. This is both to show thanks to the tenants for keeping the property in good order, but also to ensure repairs and general maintenance of the property can be maintained."
"There is a level of discrimination against people whom are not financially competent. Even on a pension that is supplied by a government department, landlords are still discriminating- believing that you are unable to pay rent. I have experienced being questioned by Real Estate agents as to why I can not get public housing etc.... and what I spend the remainder of my pension on. These are things that would be asked of a full time employed person, which I have been in the past and found it very easy then to get rental properties."
"I feel that very regularly the real estate agents do not have the tenants well being as a concern, I feel that even though maybe not in a vindictive way, but it does seem to be the case with my experiences and everyone else I know. That due to no incentive for agents they don't tend to look after the tenant, only caring for the owner to get money and any way they can to get the bond back or cut corners to make owners not have to pay for certain things that tenants legally don't have to. I just believe that if real-estate companies had more incentive to look after tenants this may occur more frequently. "
Tenant liability for all damage and theft they cause and support from courts to easily evict destructive tenants
Reduce the inspections from 3 mths to 6 mths or more. They are a real intrusion to my privacy.
"Friendlier and more compromising landlords. 
We need ceiling fans in this really hot summer in QLD. "
Better communication with agents
"Cost of renting. For example, I am renting a 2 bedroom apartment at Morningside for 340/ week ( doesn’t include gas, hot water and electricity bills) but apartment is very old and i am paying for it only because it’s close to city and my job. I think price shouldn’t be high because of where it is located, it should be based on the quality of the property."
"No body corporate for renters as we’re not told about the conditions prior to applying.

Also, ability to have pets without going through the very long application process (we’re still waiting after 2 months) or fee ($120 even if it’s declined). Of course the tenant is responsible for any damage though. "
Less discrimination against people with pets. Being able to hang photo's and pictures on hooks.
"Better training to for Property Managers in dealing with tenants.  I believe that owners are in most cases not the issue, it is how PM's treat tenants.  This is my experience, from being a renter, owner and Property Manager."
"For the bond to be increased from 4 weeks rent especially if pets involved.
For eg I as a landlord renovated the wooden polished floors and house and allowed an outside pet only.  The tenants allowed the dog to enter the house and the wooden floors are completed scratched with deep grooves to the extent even if I repolish the floor again it will never be the same.  THE bond does not cover the damage.  And also the odour of dog will be very difficult to remove from the house."
"Make it free for tenants to pay their rent electronically, if landlords and property managers decided to employ third party companies like ezi-debit for tenants to pay their rent then the fees charged by these companies should be paid by the landlord not the tenant, especially when there is no free option offered to the tenant to pay rent. I recently moved into a rental property where there is no free way to pay the rent, every payment option incur's a fee. I believe that a law should be made that states 'all fee's created by third party electronic payment providers and property managers should be paid by the landlord not the tenant. The tenant should be given the right to pay their rent electronically without a premium added on top."
"As a renter if you live in a apartment or complex with on site management they can be quite harassing, just turning up to fix something without warning, stop you as you drive out, can do inspections  every 2-3 weeks, call up rta and they say there not allowed to do that, but if your a single women and 2 men come to your door saying they have to take photos inside, and once I left continued to call and email still to this day after 8 months that has been my experience. I wish there was more I could do or that they where told they couldn't do that."
"Property Managers do not treat tenants in a fair manner.  I was recently offered a new 12 month lease 10 weeks prior to the expiry of my lease and told that If I didn't sign it within 6 days the agency would enact the notice to leave.  I was served both the lease and the notice to leave in the same email.  Please note that I have been renting this unit for 18 months and a 6 months lease will not be considered.  The agency (Coronis) managing this property also refuses to speak with tenants, and I am required to do all the run around with quote and general repairs. They are unreasonable and do not treat the tenant like a customer."
More availability of properties that allow pets and being able to make minor changes such as being able to hang pictures on the wall
"As an property owner I require tenants do two things - pay their rent on time and look after the property.  The majority of tenants do the former but looking after the property is another matter.  The two main issues is cleanliness and property damage.  I'm sick and tired of paying for repairs caused by the tenant.  The most recent occurrence was when I was charged $209 for a call-out on what I was told was a air conditioner fault.  When I received the invoice it was for ""teaching the tenant how to operate the unit"".  I find it very stressful"
Length of least agreements 6 months is too short  for long term rentals... we have had this rental for 10 years still getting new leases every 6 months no stability.  Video and pictures of our private lives taken by rental company not happy to have my home and the way we live videos and in pictures this is our private place our home...
For the owner to fix things instead of making excuses
Better contact with the real estate agency! 
"nothing, my renting experience was quite normal."
"Bond processing, allow tenants to go to Australia Post to secure their bond refund"
I wouldn't have the bond going back to the first party that puts a claim on it. The money belongs to the tenant. 
"I don't like the amount of notice agents can give.
Last week we were given 24hrs notice for a property valuation. I don't feel this is at all adequate. "
Being able to get better outcomes when tenants destroy properties.
"Being able to treat it as my own home. Being able to put up photos, hooks for plants, have pets and less inspections if you have been there more then a year."
Increased minimum time between routine inspections
"Being able to have a pet , the bond is there for a reason . Being able to mount a Tv or put photo frames up or curtains "
standard applications and reference requirements
"The tenant doesn't have to prove anything, but the owner does.  For example, if they break something in the yard they can say that it was caused by wind and there is nothing the owner can do.  "
Having the repairs/maintenance issues addressed sooner
make sure tenants stop taking advantage of the laws and make sure you can give them the same amount of notice to leave as they give you
Have a bond loan available even if you work and it over the income limit as it’s expensive to move and you need cash to do so. 
stronger rules to make tenants pay for property damage
Stronger checks on people who have rented through relatives before then do a runner and leave us the landlord two months behind in rent
"Owners change tenants for no reason, even when they are no problem and Real estate support that to get more income in the week of rent that they get on new tenancy while the tenant has huge relocation expenses.
In high demand areas is just a joke on how regular this occurs"
Being able to have pets. So many of my potential rental applications were rejected because I was honest about having a cat
More rights for property owners
Property Maintenance must be upkept by owners.  Too many repair/maintenance ignored yet still increase rent values to suit personal financial needs - not market value or condition. 
Ensure the lessor retains the right to place their choice of lessee in their property. Currently it feels like lessee’s have more rights than lessors
Give owners more rights than tenants
Agents offering a free way to pay rent.  ie BPAY or direct bank transfer.
Not enough regulations are in place to protect the owner or the property manager.  Most regulations are for the tenant 
get a landlord to actually do repairs that have been lodged
Our property manager did not complete quarterly inspections only one inspection was done in twelve months.
More clear cut rules 
Tenant vacate timeframes are not well aligned with owner vacate timeframes and are disproportionate in favour of the tenants.
"Lower the rent for people who r unemployed, pensioners, singles &  homeless."
Communication between tenant and agency. Owner communication to agency in regards to repairs and maintenance. A standard retainer for all maintenance to be completed under $1000 without approval from owner which will prevent maintenance from sitting for too long. Tenants to sign declarations for cleanliness of properties at beginning of tenancies. 
"More accountability & culpability with people renting our valuable asset, when they obscond &/or leave with damages & arrears. "
If the landlord decides to sell the property whilst there is a current lease agreement in place the tenant should have the option of breaking the lease without a termination penalty. My recommendation is the tenant has 14 days to decide if they want to break lease from when they receive the form 10 and another 30 days to vacate if they do. If the tenant decides they want to stay on and the 14 days has passed they are bound to the lease until the agreed end date. That way it will stop landlords from selling just after a tenant has moved in like wise if the tenant is not happy about the sale they have the option to leave. Its a win win for all parties
The expectations on me to 'maintain' the property are at odds with what the owner/landlord does to maintain the property. Tenants are expected to clean things most home owners don't in the interest of maintaining the property where as the landlord often plays games in relation to fixing items.
"Too biased in favour of tenants - ie one example I have to have 2 months notice to leave, tenant has to give 2 weeks. Also if tenant doesn't pay, its a lot of chasing around or writing rent losses as part of tax.
This is eventually more cost to all taxpayers
Also RTA/QLD should consider having credit rating on tenants, especially for private landlords - ie some may owe 
SPERS etc fees - There should be joint effort to help private landlords, who in  general do a good job providing housing when there are so few Gov't /Council/community houses available in many parts of QLD"
More pet friendly rental properties
Be dealing with Property Managers who are a little more experienced or trained in their profession
Continuation rights for satisfactory tenants
Landlords need rights to!
Laws regarding allowing pets. Victoria has introduced laws allowing pets and Qld should also  introduce laws allowing pets.
"Rents adequately priced to income = NO higher than 30% of personal 
weekly income!
More public housing => it is a basic human right to have a shelter, NOT 
a $$$ making venture for profit on the backs of the poorest/sick/disabled/pensioners etc...
"
"The cost of rent and having maintenance issues dealt with promptly.
"
A tighter and rigerous entry/exit condition process that would include mandatory completion of an Entry Condition Report by both parties prior to handover of keys or at least same time on site.
"I don’t rent. But, there needs to be mandatory more in depth training for property/tenancy managers. Also tenants & landlords need to be better informed of their responsibilities. Finally, there should be a government body that strictly focuses on the RTRA Act Legislation rather than QCAT, to deal with tribunal matters. The Office of Fair Trading should do no warning, random audits/check ups on all real estate agencies continually, with on the spot fines and penalty units. If an agency reaches a certain amount of penalty units within a 12 month period, the agency owner/s should be disqualified from ever running a real estate agency again. "
"We are excellent tenants, never miss payments, keep the place in the condition we would like someone to keep our property and only contact the property manager if there is something that needs to be fixed (as we live in an old Queenslander). However, we are currently living next door to the most disgusting degenerates (at least 5 x 18-21 year old males who have parties most nights of the week, vomit, urinate and defecate down the adjoining side of our house, the list could go on) - they rent that property and were not living there when we signed a 12 month lease. We are not suffering and stuck in a lease arrangement that we cannot legally or financially afford to break until the end of our 12 month lease term. We totally appreciate that this situation is not the fault of the landlord or the property owner, however we have absolutely no rights or avenues in this situation even though we have always done the right thing. There needs to be a balance between protecting landlords as well as protecting tenants."
Better rules to be able to manage good and bad tenants
"Currently the system largely favors tenants.  The RTA, Government, Taxation and media are all discouraging investment for rental properties.  This will mean shortfalls in properties available for rent pushing rents up.  It is already common for multiple family groups to be sharing one property."
Better availability of support & advice services like QSTARS
"I am a long-term renter who has recently (within the last 12 months) been presented by my Rental Agency with just one option to pay my rent. This option unfortunately incurs a fee as it is via a Rent Card agency which processes tenant's payments on behalf of the REA for a nominal fee. I strongly object to this as I would trust that at least one fee-free option would be available to all tenants.

I have recently taken up this issue with the property manager who provided me with an alternative - eftpos payment in the local office (also incurring a fee). Upon insisting that my right to pay fee-free as ever, the understanding property manager has provided me with a realistic option - bank transfer to their a/c.

I of course would like to see that fee-free payments for tenants will enshrined in legislation in our country in the future."
"It is difficult to find property owners who accept indoor cats (as they should all be indoors/caged, etc.), and I think there needs to be far better communication between the property managers, the owners (for maintenance requests, etc.) and tenants - particularly between the Property managers and tenants. Most agencies seem to have antiquated communication processes, forms systems not being in an RTA porta linked to a tenant ID that belongs to me would be ideal, so any notifications of entry, breaches to remedy, etc. can all be electronically tracked/measured and controlled by the governing body, the property owner(s), property managers and tenants "
Better protection for landlord required.   High subletting for larger homes.  Bond run down at close to lease expiry.  Pet damages and hygiene issues hidden/masked at exit.  Bond insufficient to cover the damages or unpaid rents.  Renters expect non-urgent repairs done immediately like gate not closing properly.  Renters dressing up improvements as repairs.
"More protection for property owners because the property market in Queensland is not making any profit since I bought my property in 2012, actually I lost nearly % 100.000.00"
"Fee free payment options for paying rent
The opportunity to make a rental property a home by putting up pictures, changing gardens etc without seeking approval
Minimum property security standards (fences etc) 
The ability to have pets"
Submitting criminal history upon applications 
Quicker attention to consultation process with tenants required to commit!
Making tenants liable for the rent which they have not paid
"Tennants need to be pursued for damages and owed rent. Once the Tennant is 2 weeks behind, they need to be evicted immediately without all the steps which realistically give them
6-8 weeks free rent"
Allow tenants the right to have a companion pet such as a cat.
Need renters to be more liable for their actions
More rules regardimg rent increases and bond limts lowered to more affordable amount !! No bans on pets and having rental mangers or owners stricker time frames  in getting maintenance work completed! Also all rental properties should have solar systems and water tanks fitted to help lower the cost of live for the pepole renting! 
I hate not knowing if my lease will be renewed or not. I dont like living in the unknown. I really would like to have a longer lease but 6 months and 12 months is all that is offered
Better protection for landlords in regard to unpaid rent and damage to property
"More rental properties to be pet friendly. 
Difficult for interstate move to rent in qld as most properties require prior inspection "
"More clear rules and terms in RTA law that are more easily found on the website and in standard agreements.  There are too many “grey areas”. Eg. Lightbulbs, gas cylinders, explicitly saying on a tenancy agreement that it cannot end on a Sunday etc. "
Rental bonds need to be increased.  
Better access to applicant rental history 
End of lease agreement allowing landlords to move on tenants for no reason i would like to feel secure and not be worried about being forced to leave everytime my lease ends
Nothing have a great landlord
Damage done by pets or others needs to be addressed during rental period and before tenants move out. 
"Owners are required to give two months notice to end both a fixed term and periodic tenancy.
Tenants are only required to give two weeks. I think it would be fairer to property owners if both tenants and owners were required to give 4 weeks notice. "
Improved rights for Property Owners
Pets allowed. Inspections reduced when tennants been in property for longer periods of time with no breaches.
Tenants being more responsible and looking after the premises
I (single mum) have been renting our home since 2013. The amount of damage caused to my property in that time that is not covered by my comprehensive insurance is disturbing and heart breaking. I feel that many many people do not understand how to look after a house. Education and advertisements teaching children before they leave school should be looked into.
Easier and  faster process of removing bad tenants. At the moment there are too many processes that allow bad tenants to go beyond Bond amount on rent & damage. 
"Owners should have more rights to vacate tenants from their properties should the tenants be causing issues, not allow tenants to remain if there is evidence they are causing issues and have had warnings.
It is not the owners responsibility to ensure that tenant has a roof over their head if they can not abide by the rules of the property."
Give more rights to the landlord.
"Hold tenants to their obligations, including RTA providing past records to tenants and landlords"
Form 11 remedy to breach notice - shared unit complex with common grounds & pool. All tenants breached due to one tenant leaving pool gate opened. 
"Legislation regarding change of property managers. Introduce a notice period to tenants. Currently it is ""common sense"" to notify a tenant when a change of property manager has occurred. In the mean time there is stress due to poor communication and confusion to who rent is to be paid to."
"The owner and agent need to have more control over how the property is rented to the tenant, who we can put into the property and how we are able to manage bad tenants. The tenant has too many options to allow them to work the system to the detriment of the owner."
Improve accountability of realestate agents for their actions and non actions when necessary.  Renting rules seem to me to be in the favour of the realestate agent ather than either owner or tenant. 
Implementing a Rental Bond Scheme 
Balance the law and legal system in particularly QCAT determinations all heavily biased in tenants favour. Look at Australian consumer law for balance. 
I do think it is hard for a tenant to get out of a lease if they are unhappy or need to move for any reason.  I also understand that the owner's need some protection.  It is such an expensive thing to move and then to have to pay for the advertising of a new tenant to take over the lease is quite hard.  I don't particularly know the answer though.
Real Estate Agents bond claims need to be monitored - The System allows the Real Estates to take advantage of tenants and gives them the freedom to take what ever they want out of the bond for what ever they want and charge what ever they want. The dispute system is a waste of time and only eventuates in the tenant needing to go to court and spend/loose more money then it is worth to fight to get back what the real estate has unlawfully taken. This encourages the real estates to continue  benefiting financially from unlawful bond claims without any fear of repercussions. 
Less inspections for good tenants 
Property Maintenance requests fulfilled. 
Rules for Landlords need to be tighter - Property Managers do not take responsibility
We have been an owner/occupier for 12 years. We have an investment property. I cannot comment on 'renting'.
Ensure tenants actually pay for insurance excess and increased premium after damage claim. By time they are moved out bond only covers cleanup.
"The ability to advertise a rental property affordably, without needing to use a property manager"
MORE RIGHTS FOR TENANTS with ENTRY NOTICES regarding having the rights that no person enters property unless tenant is present unless emergency services are needed at property. More notice given to tenant when entry is required. More flexibility with arranging date and time of inspection/repairs. A detailed description on entry notice explaining what is going to be done for entry eg. smoke alarm testing & also photos have to be taken of premises & safety switch inspection etc. Not just stating smoke alarm inspection. Persons name that will be entering on entry notice form. 
More protection and Security for Landlords.
I would give the owners more power to protect their investment
"Make it easier to rent a place if you have a pet ,ie dog..  i have applied for 3 properties and got declined cause of our dog even though it said dogs considered on applications.  As he is a big dog and they were meaning a smaller size one."
"I would change the social dynamic between renters and landlords because currently the imbalance of power treats tenants like children who need to be constantly monitored. It's extremely invasive and exacerbates my anxiety condition, despite the fact that I've always been an exemplary tenant. "
"Having maintenance done promptly, or if that is a problem be recompensed for having to rent a house in Queensland for over 4 months without the amenities advertised ie: working aerial that does not have water dripping in on and around it, (have pictures to confirm this).Ability to lock all doors without using wood blocks as the lock, having a working window or fan to extract steam from bathroom so black mold does NOT continue to grow regardless of how much bleach and or mold killer/retarder you use to  try and eliminate the mold."
As a tenant I am happy enough but from a property management perspective owners are loosing their rights for their property. 
Make it fairer for landlords to evict bad tenants.
Have independent company or government complet entry and exit condition reports as real estates just take tenants for a ride and charge them for things that are not their doing and because people don’t have time or money to dispute it they end up having to pay the agents.
Tenants who refuse to pay QCAT decisions and Court Registered Debts can be charged with a criminal offence for property damage.
feed back from property mamger
Tennants are not forgotten soon after leases have been signed and bonds are paid back to good tennants.
Managers that fulfill their job description and are made to do it.
Direct communication between owner and Tennant the make resolving issues easier
better vetting of tenants
The proposed law reforms for new rental laws will force me to sell the property and reinvest my money in other areas.
More responsibility taken by the tenant
"We have generally had good experiences with our old renters in the Woodford area. 

I think clarity on minimum standards would be good but as we will keep reiterating are concerned 
at how far we will have to go.
"
Reduce the amount of time to give tenants to vacate
Security of tenure and personal safety respected by compliance with RTA regulations such as Notices of Entry for contractors.
"The RTA Bond to be increased, the Notice to Leave period be the same for Owner and Tenants"
"Very clear terms on what is the tenants responsibility and landlords responsibility.  As a renter I made repairs, replaced components and did what I thought was expected.  As a landlord I have been made responsible for all the things I was doing for free as a tenant.  If the responsibilities are clearly defined then there will be surprises for anyone. (Who fixes leaky taps, replaces globes, water filters etc)"
The way Property Managers handle the rental
"Clarity around:
1) Break Lease
2) Telecommunications installations and costs (ie who is responsible owner or tenant). 
3) Stricter/ more defined laws in regards to lawn maintenance and looking after gardens
4) Terms for length of leases. "
"Make tenants more accountable, hasher penality for property damages."
Improve /Tighten  the checking process conducted by Agents on potential tenants 
Make it fair for landlords and Agents
I'd have less useless stuff to move.
Some agents provide very little for their ongoing fee.  
Tenants require clean properties when they move in but when they move out their attitude seems to change and the same standard of cleanliness drops dramatically and is very hard to prove.  As the next ingoing tenant requires a clean property the result is that the owner must request the tenant return to the property with varying success and usually the owner incurs a cleaning account which when they attempt to claim back from the bond results in varying success during mediation or going to QCAT
6 month inspections instead of 3 months.
It would be good if your property manager could have more control over enforcing issues that have been neglected for long periods of time and are not acted on even though breaches have been issued.
There should be a minimum standard of house condition when renting out. 
More pet approved homes and units.
That Real Estates advertise photos of the actual property and not ones that are similar.
"Property managers have too much access to apartments. Tenants should be allowed to deny entry into apartments and/or be given the right to reschedule entry dates & times, especially at the end of a lease when property mangers schedule multiple viewings over several weeks. This is an invasion of privacy, especially when tenants are still paying rent. There needs to be a more equal power relationship between tenants and property managers. "
Not having so many house inspections well actually photo shoot as they don’t ask if you need any repairs just snap happy with iPad.  Things to be repaired ASAP not having to keep nagging them 
Clearer definitions. There appear to be Grey areas in interpreting the act. You can go to an RTA dispute and receive information which then changes the next week at QCAT. More definition.
Ensuring the tenant pays on time and adheres to the rules.
A better definition on what is wear and tear and what is damage. Also damage by neglect or not adhering to manuals for eg pool equipment etc
I’m a property owner and I would lIke my property manager to have better negotiation skills.
Property managers to be more responsible for their role & do their job properly.
"...allowing, facilitating Rent to Buy"
To have more knowledge of tenants previous history of renting
Writing a condition report 
Quality of agents and their responsiveness to issues - speaking as both an owner and a renter
Better redress for landlords in regard to recouping out of pocket expenses incurred by bad tenants and/or deficient property managers
Simplified renting and tenant approval process for both landlords and tenants.
to know more about your tenants and there rental history
"More communication between us , Tenants, and property manager"
More security of long term tenure
Reduce agent costs and prevent smokers from smoking within the neighbourhood.
"Have a higher bond to pay for all the rent lost by landlords due to damage to property by tenants and tenants leaving without paying for all damages and not enough bond to cover it
No changes to be allowed by tenants to the property they are renting, they dont own it.
Rent to be paid in advance for atleast 2 to 4 weeks.
"
"Better real-estate customer services. They are unfriendly.
Better property managment to make sure the property standards are reach at all time by putting more responsibility to the tenants  "
I am a landlord but i was once a tenant. Real estate agent/ property manager are the worst people to deal with as they blame everything on tenants. However tenants got to behave as well.  My property manager is good.
Higher bond to reduce insurance claims
"If a tenant reports a problem or concern with the rental property. 
The owner needs to respond to the request with in a limited time"
Tenants should pay at least 1 month in advance
"The care level of real estate agents. Once you’re in a place, they tend to not care about you anymore, especially if something needs repairing. 
Also it would be great to have pets where ever we have to live. "
"More control over rental agencies and breeching of rental laws in Queensland state by the real estate agents, having an Ombudsman to oversee complaints processes towards an agent or landlord.
More auditing of rental agents and their processes. "
How landlords/property managers treat you when you end a tenancy 
Make real estate agents accountable
"I have had no problems but my daughter started a job away and had problems with raising a bond. I know a bond protects the owners but there needs to be a place where you can get a bond loan that is not government controlled. Because she works 2 part time jobs, she can get no help."
An overview of Property Managers in complex living
More maintenance attended to by owner/agent 
Landlords need the right to protect their investment.
From past experience I would question the owners opinion on renting before moving into their property to ensure they will do repairs that need to be done.
"Less frequent rental inspections for good tenants. Once you have proven that you are looking after the property, you should be rewarded with less frequent inspections.
Pets to be allowed in all rental properties. 
Able to hang pictures wherever you want. 
Basically, to be treated like an adult. "
Making rights and responsibilities clear. Lots of grey areas. A better way to solve issues that don't involve going to QCAT
"More frequent property inspections. Perhaps less invasive on tenants. More of a ""drive by type"" between full inspections."
I would ensure people are to take better care of property.
We need more affordable rentals for single tenants.
Tenants more accountable to pay for damages.
The current RTA Rules favour the tenant. The landlord is the last on the list. There needs to be more balance.
Putting insurance and renting on the same page. As I feel current rules around renting leave landlords in a situation where they aren’t protected financially at all.
Less routine house inspections. Decrease in rent. 
More media awareness of how to get information
I would like the rental inspections to include photos of the backyard and of the second bedroom which always seems 'occupied' at time of the inspections.
"More legislation and heavier consequences need to be put in place to disallow tenants to inhabit, trash and vacate properties without any concern for the owners. Higher bond needs to be collected, and QCAT Adjudicators need to be less agreeable to the tenant and actually consider their rental history and the evidence being provided/ If an agent is taking a tenant to QCAT, they have exhausted every other option beforehand. Adjudicators are very lenient towards tenants and it causes owners to be thousands of dollars out of pocket. "
I have had too many tenants damage the property. There are no reliable agents to manage property in Cunnamulla. Lack of tradesman that will quote for works. 
Exit an entry process 
"When tenants move out, all damages should be paid by tenant and not be allowed to be dragged through the system because they don't want to pay and the owner ends up having to pay some or all of the costs. This is not reasonable as the tenant caused the damage, not the owner ie: carpets and painting"
"Entry condition report - burden is very heavily on tenants to complete it thoroughly; otherwise, a lessor/agent can take advantage of the less-than-perfectly completed report and charge any repair costs to tenants"
Tenants with an excellent history record should be treated with respect.  I have no issue with owners wanting to ensure their property is well taken care of but I have an issue with QLD RE agents treating people who rent like there are lower class citizens. In NSW if you were a good tenant that was taken into account regarding how often inspections occurred and rent increases.  If you were a good tenant the worked to keep you. That is NOT that case in QLD.  
More flexibility for the tenants with lease periods
Tenants held accountable for damage
"Better response to repairs, eg plumbing.  "
having a standard of all housing...too many houses are not livable yet allowed to be rented
"Being able to have pets, as it aids my current illness. Also, to be able to place hooks on the wall."
"The only thing that could improve my renting experience is the price of rent. However, there's not a lot that can be done about that because of the economy. Oh well!"
"From my experience renting my whole life, I feel tenants (I mean good ones, not the ones trashing places) are totally demoralised. There needs to be more done to respect the fact that while a tenant may not own a home, it is, while they're renting it, for all intents and purposes, their home."
"more days to hand in the entry report. 2 days is not good enough, it should be 4 working days."
The ability to feel like you have a secure home as a renter.
"Notice period tenant must give to vacate
Bond held by the tenants
"
"All rentals in QLD should have airconditioning before being allowed to be rented out.  Tenants should be allowed to paint, decorate, hang pictures, make general improvements that do not result in damage or value reduction of the property.  Tenants should be allowed ot have pets by default.  Again, any damage is the responsibility of the tenants, but landlords should have no say if they wish to rent the property."
The on site manager (that’s isn’t the landlord) does whatever he wants. Tells people to do things he has no right over like where to put kitchen bins and office chairs
I have never rented in Qld before 
Have tenants who respect the property
"Forbid sending without grounds terminations with fixed period lease renewals, or in response to failing to renew a fixed period lease."
Fewer inspections.  Change from every 3 months to every 6 months.
"i brought an investment property in Doonlandella over 2 years ago under advisement from a financial adviser and it has been nothing but problems. I am not getting the rent i was promised and the home has had a number of tenets since being built. tenents have not looked after the property resulting in a lot of repairs needed and it has cost me far more then it should have. Also the value of the property has dropped by $30,000 in the last 2 years.    "
Improve incentives for real estate agents to work for tenants as much as they work for landlords. 
Better protection for landlords.
That all houses rented in QLD  it should be mandatory for fans aircon and security screens to be fitted due to the extreme heat especially through out summer also that for power and cost so high solar panels on roof to help tenants with overbearing cost from power companies the gov is and has ways to bring the cost of putting solar on houses
Make managing agents more responsible for the properties they are supposed to be looking after.
Able to get things fixed.
Having both tenant and landlord having to give the same notice to leave the property
More feedback when rental amounts differ
Pet ownership. Making lease agreements minimum 1 year if not longer 
More notice when as a tenant the house goes on the market for sale
Property managers are generally terrible and need better regulation but the worst thing is their new payment methods that make you incur a cost.
Change property manager.
More honesty and accountability from Property Managers
"Not having to pay for all the water we use, not being locked into a metered network for electricity "
"Strong protection of tenant's rights to live in rental property as own home. (Less routine inspections, Right to have routine inspection at tenant's convenient time, No entry by property manager when tenant is not home, no photos at each inspection unless there is an issue, Legal enforcement to have repair & maintenance to be done in reasonable time frame or due date to the satisfactory result to tenant, Longer lease period, Rights to keep pets indoor, Rights to decorate home as tenant's wish.)"
"It is currently skewed to favour owners rather than renters, I'd like to see a more useful advice body. The RTA website is not helpful and any advice requested is often unhelpful at best, or misleading at worst."
I'd like to be able to make the house feel like home hang picture have pet stuff like that.
Would love to pay less rent! I'm a single mum & my rent (townhouse) is half my pay. My friends mortgage (house) is less than my rent but I can't save for a deposit.
Not informing the real estate agent or landlord about the damage & repairs
Increase bond. More power to remove bad tenants
Tenants should pay the full amount of their water usage.
"Laws favour tenants bit to much. 
Worst part is if they don't pay - if no pay owners should be able to boot them almost immediately, like any other business!"
More bond to allow pets to reside at property
"Being former with tenants as the nice you are the more the tenants expect. 
I have a great tennant but she calls me when she needs to replace globes, is that up to the landlord to
Replace them?
I had another tennant who signed up for 12 months & broke the lease because of a house being built next
door & deliberately caused issues which she knew would cost me money to employ tradesmen to be called 
out after hours. "
Property managers who know what they’re doing. 
Better screening of tenants.
I would provide LANDLORDS with the opportunity to act on behalf of themselves and their property in a way that DIRS NIT favour tenants. 
"Allow pets - it’s Australia, people love their pets and they help so much in life"
I’ve had no issues as both a tenant or a landlord 
Make landlords have to fix big problems with property asap.
A centalised database for condition entry report
Cost of outgoings are given back to the tenant which is what is done in Commercial tenancies. 
Renters are treated as second class citizens. Get rid of property managers as a middle man and create a regulatory body to manage the rental market.
Property managers to have more control re. the 'timely' exiting of tenants who don't pay rent over a period of time or damage rental housing/ property.
Repairs/maintenance bill
"The out of control rental costs, they are allowed to get too high. The landlord should be covering a percentage of the mortgage cost , pay their rates and water etc, tenant should only be paying  a percentage of the mortgage and water."
"I wouldn’t change how I do things, however I do think there needs to be more pet friendly places available. "
"Owners rights are limited, and treated like second class citizen. I have made the investments, but am limited in access, and power to enforce reasonabale standards"
A better rental agent.
"More control needs to be made over getting rid of onsite managers who have bought the management rights. 
Eg if they are harassing tenants just to feel important there needs to be a clause to be able to make them sell the rights. "
Respect for young people 
Prevent pets from rental accommodation due to the residual odours from pets urinating and defecating inside the building
Providing far more clarity around the definitions and intent behind the legislation so interpretations of the legislation are not so varied.
"'- Better system to make bad tenants accountable and pay their debts for damages
- Longer listings of bad tenants on database.
- Introduce pet bonds
- Allow agencies to request professionals carpet cleaning and pest control. Currently a lot of arguments over the cleanliness of carpets and suitable (safe) pest control treatments."
Private home owners with a good record being able to rent a property without references
Give tenants the opportunity for recourse if owner is not willing to reasonably maintain their property - complaints are met with threats of being asked to leave property in 2 months as is their right to remove tenants without grounds
To be able to have my dog without the hassle I have to endure today. 
"Attitudes of landlords and property managers seriously need to respect that a rental tenancy ageement is a mutually beneficial arrangement. Both lessors and lessees are equal partners.  Sometimes I feel that we're still in the Middle Ages when greedy exploitive ""landlords"" held tenants hostage to their whims with the power to disrupt lives.  I absolutely ABHOR being treated as a barely tolerated cash cow. I wasn't born to make other people wealthy."
"Change 'Break Lease' rules. NSW much fairer to tenants. After 12 months tenancy only 2 weeks notice of intention to break lease required. Now in Qld real estate agents demand lease extensions be signed 2 months before expiry or a Notice to Leave Without Reason is given and the property is advertised as available. It is not known what properties will be available when the lease expires and breaking the lease to obtain a property early
involves substantial costs."
"Less inspections once a proven good long term tenant (3x inspections in first 6months, 2x inspections in following 6months, then 2x inspections for following yearly leases)"
The cost of rent is 2/3 of my income. Doesn't leave much left to bring up 3 children!
Estate agents with more diligence and integrity.
The time an Owner has to complete reasonable repairs / maintenance from when they are reported to enable the continuance of peaceful enjoyment of a property
"A feeling of more protection to tenants to have their rights exercised.

My husband is worried we'll be treated poorly by our building manager for lodging notices to remedy breaches around outstanding repairs where the building manager just won't commit to fixing them. We're talking months of ""I'm on it""."
Transparency within the management of tenant agencies
"1. detailed definition of fair wear and tear clause
2. empowering property agents to be responsible for accurate entry condition reports (pro forma ECR docs need reviewing to be more broad and specific)
3. having the process in place to make the tenant responsible for 100% of costs associated with damage at the lease close out date, not to have to go through the court process only to get low % of actual damage costs awarded to owner.
4. more education through flow diagrams of processes including bond return and court process's for owner and tenant
"
"I would like to see a cultural shift in attitudes toward people renting, with owners and real estate agents recognising that you are a paying 'client' for a service, rather than a person who has automatically been categorised in a lower social/economic class. "
Allow more prompt and easier removal of problem tenants.
"Property owners to be held accountable for installing solar power energy and providing quick and efficient repair work.  Owners and their agents have replaced items e.g. hot water systems, stoves, sewerage works at their convenience, but tenants are expected to keep paying their rent on agreed time whether these things are safe, working, and are a threat to health."
I think that pets should be allowed regardless of the landlord's request. Statistics on pet's abandoned due to landlord's not allowing pets is horrific and absolutely disgusting that so many pets are given away due to this law.
The rental renewal process. Or to remove fixed teem rentals.
"Hold people accountable for rent and damages owed - tenant (and landlord) rating database, rating based on reports by all parties. Bond size based on tenant rating. Poor landlords would find their properties vacant as noone would rent from them. Poor tenants would end up in public housing as private landlords would not accept."
"Acknowledgement that tenants are people, too.  Not everyone can afford to buy a house.  That shouldn't make tenants second-class citizens."
The quality of understanding between property managers and tenants
I would like longer leases. At the moment we have been on six monthly leases for two years. It is frustrating and unnecessary. 
More flexible with making the house you rent a home instead of a show house
Having the ability to easily pay rent without having to incur fees for the privilege of doing so.
Longer lease would be reassuring
"Rental homes are often sold and tenants asked to leave, despite being pleasant and courteous tenants.   I would like to rent one home for my whole life if I so desired.  I've been asked to leave three times in five years due to landlords selling their properties.  Permanency counts.  "
Include water in rent ... by not including in rent it actually makes rent higher ... should NOT add on later UNFAIR
"Affordable rent, having the right to treat a place as your home and not so many restrictions on what you can do."
Stricter laws that do not favor tenants
Long term leases and less invasion of privacy.
"That the house must be in 100% working order when I move in - all lights, fittings, fixtures work - so I don’t have to submit months of maintain employment requests to get resolved."
"should be treatment even  landlord and tenant.,Eg: finish the lease ,landlord need 2 months notice, but tenant only need 2 weeks notice , it is not fare.should be even ,"
Being able get rewards for paying on time. Any problems ie repairs should be action as soon as possible. And flexibilty be able make it HOME ie putting photos on the walls .
"Unavailable New property manager. Taking 2 weeks to look at a maintenance request as all requests can only be sent via app and her email tells you not to phone and inquire, that she is out of the office for at least 3 days a week and she will prioritize your needs when she is in."
Better property management required by agents especially in lower socio economic areas..
Responsibility and accountability of tenants to abide by written agreements and take care of the property as if it were their own.
"My current renting experience is great, have a great Real Estate, hasn't been in the past. Finding a rental property is very demoralising and stressful though, this needs to change if possible."
Ability for landlords to have tighter controls on tenants
"Less inspections and less invasive. Once every 6 months should be the maximum permitted inspections, unless otherwise can be justified. And no photos should be permitted."
Solar Power and solar hot water
Solar bonuses re usage to be passed on to the tenant
The option of allowing pets inside
"There should be no fixed term contract agreement for tenancy.
The agreement should not be signed electronically. It must be signed with wet signatures.
Realestate agents should not charge tenant for minor wear and tear."
Owning an apartment does not mean you have any rights to expect a peaceful existence where animals are concerned. Our experience is the rights of some tenants supersede those of others in the building and neighbourhood. 
Increased bond to ensure correct tenant behaviour and actually be able to cover repairs.
"Rental inspections every 13 weeks, after 8 years we have proved we are good tenants. Inspections should be reduced, they are mainly a revenue raiser for Real Estate Agents.
Also taking a lot of photos of your home is an invasion of privacy & most times is done without the courtesy of even asking!

Landlords need to react to repair requests within a time frame, we have waited months for repairs & more than once!

There should be no additional fees ""ever"" when paying your rent.


Animals should be allowed but with strict rules.


"
More power to renters for maintenance.
Give greater support to the owner 
People be allowed to have pets.
Stop people bidding on properties.
"Stop the ability of neighbours to make loud, excessive of intrusive noise.  That's neighbours in the flat / unit  complex, or adjoining residential houses.  that's  TV's, sound systems, parties, loud car engines, mobile phones on speaker.   Ear-phones are so easy to get, everyone should be using them who is living close to others, & likely to impose their 'noise' on others.  Make sound-insulation of shared walls and ceilings compulsory in new builds.
This has been the one distressing factor wherever I have rented, either house of flat - surrounding folk are unaware & inconsiderate of neighbours &/or have 'industrial deafness'.
Allow owners to designate whole complexes as 'quiet zones' , family zones, and advertise as such, so that prospective tenants know up front.
Add an RTA -run mediation process for 'noise-issues' between tenants/neighbours.
"
Ability to get additional costs (over bond) from tenants
Being able to hang whatever you want on the walls
Higher bonds. Always having a choice of allowing a pet or not. 
RTA investigate more into Disputes and not shrug off to QCAT
"That tenant has more rights. Perhaps a point system . Also allow animals.  They are not the ones the mess up homes ,people do . "
I would like to see the property left in the condition it was when the tenants came into the property. It never is and always needs lots of effort on my part to bring it back to the condition it was when the tenancy started. Allowing animals in would only make the situation so much worse.
I would want to have more protection from tenants who do not look after the property. 
Assured greater length of renting contract
regular communication between tenant and managing agent - monthly newsletter?
Increase bond to 6 weeks and tenants to give longer notice than 2weeks to vacate
A cap on rent.  The peice is ridiculous.  There is no value for money most times and rent takes up a huge amount of a paycheck making living expenses difficult to meet.  More regulation is needed.
Tenants cannot use bond for there last few weeks rent as there is no rent left for damages
"I rent long term - 12 month leases. I am in 6th year.  The Agency insists on 3 monthly inspections which are an absolute inconvenience. I got permission from the landlord to revert to 12 monthly inspections, but the Agent talked the landlord back to 3 month inspections.
All my inspections have been 100% passed. Agents are aggressive and patronising in their attitudes and enjoy causing discomfort.
"
Should be more protection for rental property owners
"More security with more notice if you have to leave. 1 month is really not enough to find somewhere else, pack a houseful of goods & deal with the emotional stress of moving."
"I'd like to be treated decently, and not ripped off by greedy landlords looking to profit beyond what we pay in rent. Landlords and real estate agencies should have to prove that damage has been caused if they are to confiscate bond. "
Allowing pets without additional consultation.  Surely bond should relay fears of damages
Ability to pursue tenants who skip out on their rent.
Separate water /sewerage charge for landlords and then tenants to pay directly to Urban Utilities for water usage.  Similar to Victoria's set up.
Expectations on behalf of the property owner - Sharing cost of repairs.
Allow well behaved pets (like indoor-only cats) to be always permitted in apartments. 
Better communication between owner/agent/tenant.
Strict guidelines for bad tenants
 stricter rules for owners
Property manager who is reasonable 
"Improved accountability of real estate agents, to both the landlords and renters.
 "
"Pets approved. Being able to hang pictures and wall mount clothes dryers, tv's etc. 
Water tanks in properties that stipulate particular care to lawns and gardens where tenants are required to pay all water usage charges"
"I am told multiple times I can not afford a rental property that I apply for because they use the 30% rent to income rule. I know in my budgeting what I can afford, yet they instantly decline my inquiries because of this rule. It's made securing a rental property near impossible. "
Wish my agency would reply quicker when there is a problem 
"The QLD Tenant & Rooming Accommodation Act legislation is not worth the paper it is written on.  

The legislation requires a complete overhaul with significantly more rights to the tenant especially with respect to maintenance & repair of the property.

I had always been a home owner until 4 years ago when domestic violence & divorce hit.  

This is the 2nd property I have been in QLD & once again, the landlord/real estate agent has no intention of maintaining/repairing the property; doors do not close properly, doors do not lock, doors are inaccessible, no lighting in rooms, no shower, faulty plumbing, no TV reception in family room, extremely loose kitchen tap, wasps & ant nests, water leaking through the windows, etc. We don't have the ""basics"" in the house (& the previous house) & NOBODY CARES.

In the previous property we had no working oven & hotplates, no air conditioning, non locking external doors etc; I complained regularly - nothing repaired; then we received a ""no ground eviction"".  I took the landlord to Court due to $20,000 worth of damaged possessions due to floods to the house (which the real estate agent & landlord ignored); lost in Court.

Tenants have no rights.

Before any house is rented an independent authority should inspect the property to ensure the house does not breach the legislation with respect to maintenance issues; if it fails the inspection, then the house shouldn't be repaired until all the maintenance issues are repaired.

If after the house is rented & maintenance issues emerge & the landlord repeatedly neglects to address the maintenance issues; the tenant should have the legal right to not pay the landlord until the maintenance issues are addressed.

Tenants can't complain about property issues because we receive a ""no ground eviction""; we don't have the $$$$ to relocate every time a landlord breaches the so called tenant legislation."
Improve the compentency of property managers and reduce the turnover of property managers - as a landlord I am continually chasing them up on things and never know who my current manager is!
"I am a long-term tenant of predominantly long-term tenants and housed in two separate buildings of 10 units.  There is a communal pool with NO Pool rules and new tenants have moved in and use the pool as a party place, two of our units front on to the pool.  I am in the process of finding out my rights as a long-term, considerate and clean tenant who loves the peace and moved here because of it.  That is IF there is any.  

In answer to the question, would say long-term tenants like myself should be appreciated and considered BEFORE new tenants move in or at least have rules for the pool to abide by. "
Improve bond refund process when moving from one rental place to another - transferable bond would be more efficient and affordable
Tenants to pay all utilities. 
"'Remove the Landlord's right of eviction for ""No Reason"" at the end of tenancy agreement.
In 2012, after many decades away, I re-entered the Ipswich rental market.

Between April 2012 and August 2015 I was forced to move twice, for no other reason than encountering vindictive property managers, as follows:

- Sharon Anderson - First National, Brassall. Property: 1a Roberts St, North Ipswich.
- Wolfgang Rahe - Liberty Real Estate/ LJ Hooker Mudgeeraba. Property: 2 Lukin Ct, Brassall.

I've been at my current, 3rd address, since August 2015 without issue.

I have long term health issues, exacerbated by the stress of moving house, so it was not until I had settled at my current address that I began to investigate the obligations of the Landlord under the Residential Tenancy Act, and understood not only the breaches of the act by these Property Managers, but also their standover/bullying behaviour.

I will be submitting much more detail re these issues before 30th November."
The personal rights of tenancy 
Capping rental fees.
"The rules around damage and pets need to be strengthened.  I have had a tenant damage carpet with lip stick, all I was able to do was have them clean the carpet.  The carpet should have been replaced, now I have to wear the cost!
I had another tenant not tell me the plumbing was blocked until after the toilets over flowed and flooded the bathrooms damaging the vanities.  I had to wear all those costs!
The unit complex I am in did not allow pets, this has been over turned.  I have had pets from other units damage external property.  I have to cover these costs!  Tenants having automatic rights to pets is way to much risk on the owner."
Allowing pets and also making it easier to break lease when there is a change in circumstances
Renting is completely up to luck. If you get a good owner things get repaired. If you get a bad owner you are out of luck and have to deal with whatever problems there are
"The amount that rent that goes up every year. My husband is no longer able to work and I am on a DSP. Our rent increases by $20 a week - $1040 per year. We pay our rent on time & look after our the property as if it were our own but sadly our weekly amount is too becoming too much, even with rent assistance. "
the way rent is collected and a portal to view your payments and history
Would love to be able to hang pictures etc on the walls
Real estate communication and attitude. 
Better service and treatment
My tenants have too much control over access to the property for inspections. the terms reasonable access and reasonable enjoyment of the property are too vague.  The form 9 for access even states in bold that the tenant can cancel the inspection even after they have agreed to it. 
A clear and consistent process when starting and ending a rental agreement.
"Being able to have a pet, I had to re-home the dog I got when I was 10 when I moved out of my parents house as I could not find a home that I was able to take a pet to. "
"If a rental is 'cheap' rental agents and owners often ignore their obligations (carrying out inspections and responding to maintenance requests). Even though there are rules and forms in place to balance tenant and owner interests, rental agencies will go around the rules and it is up to the tenant to know their rights and be able to communicate their rights back to rental agents effectively. "
Giving landlords more control over their expensive asset
"Owners being held responsible for maintaining and repairing their investment. 

Not enough is done to ensure tenants are living in a safe and healthy home. "
"Rental Inspections mandatory 6 months, we've had every 12 weeks for 3 years.

allowing pets without permission
The increased ability to reclaim water usage expenses and certainly not seeing some of these changes come in to being
better bond to pay for tenants destruction
Tennants to be held more accountable for property damage and un paid rent
The residential tenancies legislation is far too much in favor of the tenant.
"more information in regards to bond  loans,returns clearer information."
Rental amount closer to outlays
Have better recourse when tenants trash your property or stop paying & wont leave. 
"More houses that allow pets - it's very difficult to find something suitable.  And while we haven't had many issues in this regard, it would be good to have a landlord register as well as a tenant register.  Some landlords are not responsive about problems or requests during the lease period - it would be good to have a system where tenants could check u like landlords can on a tenant's history.  "
Increase bond amount to cover realistic costs that a tenant may incur.
"We need a feedback data base on landlords/agents as well as tenants, as someone who not only has rental properties but also rents because of remote work opportunities I have seen both side of the equation. There also needs to be a commitment from landlords about the availability of the property, putting tenants in and immediately putting the property on the market and expecting to hold open houses is an invasion of privacy and really not on."
"Long term rents
Better presentation of premises both before and especially after the rental
Repairs, timeframes"
Repairs should be completed prior to start of tenancy. 
More options for the early termination of a tenancy agreement.
Control pets in buildings
Being able to lodge things electronically
Ending a lease earlier when circumstances have changed is very difficult. Tribunal was one sided.
Real Estate management of rental properties deemed very insufficient.
"Make it compulsory for Real estate agents to subscribe to tenant blacklisting databases, and make it compulsory for them to blacklist a tenant if the tenant has a QCAT decision made against them.

We had an experience where we had to take a tenant through QCAT and then through the Magistrate's court to get money back for their damages, and then at the end (after 18 months and we were still thousands out of pocket) the RE Agent said they could not blacklist the tenant because they did not subscribe to tenant databases."
Maintenance need to have stronger guidelines to ensure that the tenant doesn't end up disgruntled because an owner won't fix something that was in good order from the beginning of the tenancy. 
The way the bank guarantees are structured so the landlord does not have a hold over it if there's a dispute. 
"With so much apartment development having been allowed, I think noise laws need a complete overhaul. Tenants and owners alike need more accessible options than having to call police or council for recourse when there is continual disturbance by noise from other lots (whether it is particularly loud or not)."
Tenants privacy regarding rental house sales.
more accountability on the rental agents.
Difficulty in dealing with RTA and interpreting the laws
That the property owner has more rights
Not applicable as I am a landlord rather than a renter.
Only reasonably new at being a landlord so have really had no real problems at this stage.
"The tenant left in March 2018 after a six month tenancy, owing rent, and causing around $1400 of damage to our property, which I (as the Landlord and property owner) had to pay for. The tenant requested a refund of her $750 bond from the Residential Tenancies Authority (RTA. To prevent the bond being refunded to her, we were forced to fight to retain the bond to partly offset the costs of damage repairs, by lodging an objection to the refund - first to the RTA and then through QCAT. The tenant did nothing - and had to do nothing - to get her bond repaid, apart from asking for it back. We were forced to spend many hours dealing first with the RTA, then later preparing the case to put to QCAT, including photographs of property damage before and after - and had to pay a fee to QCAT for the privilege. Again, the tenant did nothing and had to do nothing. If we had not gone to all the trouble we were forced to go to, just to stop her being refunded the bond, she would have been automatically refund the bond. As it turned out, we had to take a morning off work to attend the QCAT hearing – the tenant did not respond and did not show up for the hearing. It is absolutely, grossly unfair that we (the Landlord) had to fight so hard and spend so many hours, just to prevent a bad tenant being automatically repaid her bond.
We should not have been forced to through QCAT. When we objected to the tenant being repaid her bond to the RTA, and the tenant took no action and did absolutely nothing to respond, it should have ended there – the tenant should have forfeited the bond.
Instead, we were forced to spend many hours and extra money going through the QCAT system. This shows that there is a complete imbalance in the system - the balance is weighted too heavily towards the rights of the Tenant and against the legitimate rights of the Landlord.

So – the one thing I would change about the current system, is to make it mandatory that the RTA must refund the bond to the Landlord (or such portion of the bond claimed by the Landlord) where there is a dispute over repayment of the Bond back to the tenant, where the tenant does not respond to a request from the RTA to provide sound reasons in writing as to why part or all of their bond should not be paid to the Landlord. In the event of a dispute where the tenant does respond in writing and the RTA is unable to resolve the differences between the Landlord and the Tenant, then (and only then) should the bond refund dispute be escalated through the QCAT system.

For the tenant to have to do absolutely nothing, with the landlord being forced to undertake many hours of work and deal with all the QCAT paperwork, to get justice, is just wrong and unfair.

In our case, after waiting from March until September for the QCAT hearing (which the tenant didn't respond to or attend) we finally got the $750 bond repaid to us. We were still out of pocket over $1000. We were told that we would have to chase her through the Magistrates Court to get this - we decided it just wasn't worth the time and trouble. I will never rent a property to a tenant again. The law is far too heavily weighted in the tenant's favour and the processes to obtain justice for the Landlord part too time-consuming, expensive and cumbersome."
Shorten the time it takes to get a QCAT hearing. 
"There is an inspection every 3 months and at every inspection photos are taken. The photos are taken of every room, every inspection. I dont know where these photos are stored? On the device? On a cloud server? Who sees them? When my child has been sick in bed photos have been taken of the room with my sleeping sick child. I dont have any recourse. I think photos should be taken to document maintenance and damage. Why EVERY 3 months. More transperancy. If the owner gets a photo report. I want one too. I should have the right to reply if I dont agree with the contents.
Also. Why an inspection every 3 months? I have lived at my home for 11 years. Unnecessary in my opinion. If I cant be trusted after 11 years when can I be trusted?"
I would like tenants to pay for their total water account
The length of time to get items repaired. There is no consistency in making sure everything is operational in long term rentals
More notice (4 weeks) required to vacate at end of fixed term lease.
Strict building design regulations for noise control. 
Remove land tax
Having a board which regulates rental prices
Having tenants respect they DO NOT own the Property
Rent payment systems that don't charge an extra fee.
Removal of what appears to be a queensland habit of having an on-site manager/caretaker.  this is not the experience in other states I have owned or rented property in and our experience in Qld has been unpleasant to say the least as the on-site manager is very unhappy he is not my managing agent and makes life miserable for both owner and tenant (I know it is not strictly a rental matter from your perspective but its a good opportunity to comment)
"I’d like to be able to have a dog for my son who has autism. Unfortunately our current landlord won’t grant us permission, and then it becomes a liability when needing to move. Long term tenancy options aren’t easy to find, so a dog for us, as essential as it is to my son’s wellbeing, isn’t possible."
Being able to charge/pay a pet bond
"Allow landlords to decide their own bonds and how much rent in advance. 
At present there is very little protection to cover landlords property. 
Many tenants abuse the system as it is currently setup.
It is very easy for a bad tenant to use up any bond in overdue rent leaving nothing for cleaning and repairs which often amounts to thousands of dollars."
"I rented for many years in north Qld until i was able to purchase a home. I found the real estate did not look after renters and had to jump through hoops to retain my bond. My last experience was when the real estate would not give me back my bond until I had returned to the property to clean the bugs out of the front porch light. even after i had paid for a professional bond clean. I was forced to drive nearly 200km round trip to satisfy the agent. 
I was forced to leave my home a few years later when my work circumstances changed at which point I became a landlord. Local government laws discriminate against mum and dad investors by imposing higher rates on rental properties. this was challenged and won in court bu was then overturned by the state government in a late night sitting.  "
I do not agree with house inspections. I rented in the USA for several years and did not have any inspections until I left the property. It is extremely stressful for the entire family and you have to go through it every three months! 
"That rental properties comply with a standard of living that considers comfort, safety, connectivity and sustainability.  To give an example, when I was in the army, all DHA service residence properties had to include comfortable sleeping areas (air conditioned master bedroom, ceiling fans in other bedrooms), security screens and deadlocks.  Service residences were expected to be upgraded to meet the requirements of modern technology.  Finally, service residences were expected to be kept in good repair.  Whilst this may seem like extra costs for the landlord, it ensures happy tennants, increased property value and additional tax leverage, all of which are a win for the landlord. 

On the subject of sustainability, despite governement focus on recycling and renewable energy, there is nothing that provides landlords with extra incentive to ensure their rentals are contributing to sustainablity.  Providing landlords with a little bit more incentive to bear the cost of solar electricity, battery banks and solar hotwater systems unltimately moves our state closer to being a world leader in environmentally aware, sustainable living."
"Rules for the landlord's should be the same as for the tenants, namely the notice period - if it's two weeks for the tenant it should be two weeks for the landlord, if it's two months for the landlord then it should be two months for the tenant - the same as the UK"
"Having more rights as a landlord.  I would like to see tenants give more notice than 2 weeks when landlords need to give 2 months notice.
"
Access to online pictures of rental properties. 
Have not rent for a long time.  But have had tenants being threaten and not abiding by the Tenancy Agreement which that states the guides for them to follow
Make it easier for landlords to kick out tenants not paying rent. 
"Qld lacks the legislative infrastructure to support pet ownership and options of extended leasing agreements, generally I am offered 6 or 12 months which creates stress and pressure on my living situation."
"Rigid inspection schedules.

Pet contracts, why are they needed when we know our obligations when renting and being a responsible pet owner"
Reduce the period of notice needed to inform a tenant their lease will not be renewed to 1 month instead of 2 as they only have to give 1 month's notice if they do not wish to renew their lease.
Less inspections if you are a long term good tenant with excellent inspection history. There should be regular inspections done for the first 18-24 months after that maybe a yearly one to check for maintenance issues. Privacy should be respected. I get that landlords need to know their property is looked after but shouldn’t privacy be given too. If a tenant is good shouldn’t there be a reward? I don’t mind them checking but every three months really? Even six months is too often. I’m a clean tidy person who always passes inspections so why can’t I have some privacy? If the police are called then the realestate should be notified and an inspection should be able to be made after every police attendance to assess any property damage. 
Making Real Estate agents more accountable for the job they are employed to do.
I feel that having an excellent rental record over the past 50 years should make an inspection every three to four months unnecessary. It's insulting.  
"Not renting at all and actually being able to afford a home. I'd like to see my generation be able to afford homes through some sort of effective policy that addresses negative gearing among other things. Housing is a human right....although I guess QLD doesn't technically have a human rights declaration anyways. 

Generally though, real estate agencies have way to much power in renting situations. As renters we are completely dependant on their ability to be competent and not rip us off...."
"I do not like having strangers come into my home, photograph my possessions every three months. I lived in the same home in the USA for 10 years and not once did my landlord invade my personal privacy or quite enjoyment of my rental home."
Making landlords accountable - Advertising a NBN ready house should require the landlord to be responsible for the NBN backup battery.
Make it easier and more accepting of pets for renters
The amount of paperwork that you have to do in order to move from one renting house to another.
"As a single mother, my rental applications often get overlooked or not looked at at all. I'd love to be given the chance to rent a nice home that I can afford without being punished for only having one income"
Booking court appointments quicker for tennants who stop paying rent
Real Estate companies manipulating the rental market to artificially inflate rent prices. It should be investigated.
"We were the tenants in a property during the past 12 months and we were the owners of a property that was leased to others.  In both cases the property managers were a nightmare.  For our own property the manager charged for 'maintenance' that had never been carried out and signed the tenants into a 12 month lease despite us only wanting to lease the property for 6 months.  The tenants also caused damage - water damage to carpet, oil staines on concrete, damaging bench tops, failed to water gardens, damaged walls and door frames - none of which was recovered from the bond.

As tenants the property manager failed to follow-up on any maintenance (toilet seat coming off, pailings missing from the staircase) the owner of the property was shocked and devastated that nothing had been followed up and that he too had also been charged for maintenance that was never attended too."
"I would love to be able to get my kids a dog.  Even if we could get the landlord to agree to a dog in this property, we couldn't risk it as it would make finding another rental extremely hard if this landlord decided to stop renting this property."
Better electronic communication from landlords - slipping paper notes under doors is not a great way to communicate when email/sms is instant and much clearer
More protection for landlords from bad tenants.
"Agents to better problem solve when a repair is required.
Reduce small repairs that are common sense to fix."
Longer rental tenure
Tenants to pay for their water usage.  This would (hopefully) limit the amount of water used and therefore the impact on the environment and ultimate expense to both tenant and property owner.
Make Solar Power(panels) mandatory for all rental properties in North QLD
Quicker turn around on enquiries to Real Estate
I never want to deal with a rental agency and all their unregulated practices ever again. 
'-Routine apartment inspections every 3 months is beyond excessive
"Pets allowed without discrimination on type of pet, size, etc."
"Frequency of property inspections. After it has been established in the first couple of inspections that you aren't kicking holes in walls, it is absolutely excessive to have someone coming through the house to inspect it every 12 weeks. It's an invasion of privacy and completely unnecessary when you've been renting a property without incident for years."
Lower the cost of weekly rent
The fact that you have to clean the property when ending a contract better to when you moved in. Every time I have moved into a rental property the cleaning has been substanded but when it is time for us to vacate we have had to clean better than when we moved in for fear our bond will be taken away - I believe this to be very unfair.
"I don't like using ""rentalrewards"" to pay rent as im charged $6-$7 every time i pay rent. I would rather use bpay if i could"
"Rental agents do not care about the tenants at all. They try to get as much money out of you as they can, and they are rude and nasty as soon as you have signed the lease. "
Either rent prices or the bad real estates/landlord
Responsiveness form the agency and reposes to requests and maintanence 
"I would increase protections for tenants to permit extension of leases, particularly for older tenants.  Having to move when one is over 70 is difficult and exhausting.  Being at the mercy of the landlord, who can refuse to extend a tenancy for any reason, creates uncertainty and stress.  Provisions should be made for tenants of good character who take good care of the property.  I would also allot tenants to make alterations to the house, including installing picture hooks and hooks for hanging personal items outdoors, without requiring that all of those items be removed when the tenant vacates or the tenant sacrifices the bond.  Tenants want their rental house to be their home, and want to add those personal touches which make it a home.  Thanks for listening."
To allow your family pets to come with you so limited in house choices because of this.
Consistency. Greedy owners. Constant turnover of property managers. Difficult process to get anything done/responses.
More legislation for owners to maintain the property to better standards
More emphasis shown on previous condition of renting. People who don't look after houses get same opportunity as people who look after houses. It's not fair 
I'd make leasing more flexible for tenants than only Agents/Owners having an upper hand.
General maintenance & caring for the property - landlords need to take responsibility for maintaining their investment & real estate agents need to accept things depreciate over time.
It should be a requirement for landlords to install air conditioners in some parts of Queensland.
"How long it takes to get things fixed as a renter apposed to how qickly the real estate will issue a breach notice if you fall behind on rent, etc. "
More transparent application process
For the real estates to listen to our concers properly
"As a tenant, I would not change anything. 
As a landlord, I want increased ability / legislation or penalties for tenants who leave properties after causing substantial damage or owe money. 
As a Property Manager I want changes to legislation to make it more equitable for tenants & landlords. "
Everywhere should be pet friendly 
"I'd like to have better affordability closer to the city and to be able to have pets. Also being allowed to request for new items to be installed - airconditioner, solar panels, new coat of paint, a dishwasher without the expectation that rent will increase."
Better communication and an opportunity to have an animal. 
If there were more properties available that are pet friendly 
No constant price increases 
Reduce the number of inspections each year for tenants that have rented the same property for more than five years.
"A minimum standard on structural & cosmetic conditions of houses. Responsible tenants able to have pets without needing to get prior approval, secondary pet bond would help owner insurances. Tenants also able to put a nail in a wall to hang pictures without needing approval under a provision in tenancy contract that requires tenant to repair holes upon departure of home."
Being able to treat the home more as your own
Real Estates to be more accountable for the treatment of tenants.
"Communication from property managers / rental agents - my experience is that the service is pretty poor, many don't let you know if a viewing is cancelled, keep you updated on an application, communicate regarding repairs that are needed etc....but they are very quick to get in contact if there is rent overdue"
More rights for renters. Bond matters held by a third party organisation and an easily accessible third party complaints organisation 
I would like to have cooking facilities 
"More freedom to pant inside with good quality paint that doesn’t show marks 
Done in neutral colours"
Being allowed to have pets more easily.
The people I chose to sign a lease with. 
"More rights for renters - especially in regards to pets and making changes to the property. Also more fairness when it comes to having to break a lease i.e. being liable for the rent up to a certain date (say one month) not until the lease would have ended, which could be months if they drag their feet replacing the tenant."
Better customer service from property managers
I have experienced very different levels of service from different property managers as a renter 
"each renewal the rent price increases. 
"
more affordable and more properties down southern end
Being able to securely rent for longer periods as I have been a long term very good tenant for years as I'm priced out of the current real estate market.  Renting with more then one pet is also something that needs to change. 
Less periodic inspections for long term rentals.
Have long term tenants
Letting people take responsibility for the yard and responsible pet ownership.
"Nothing at present 
My landlord,  agent  are awesome the communication is amazing."
Enforcement of privacy laws. When applying for rental we (the renter) hands in lots of sensitive information to the property owner/manager/agent. Currently there is no way to know how those information are stored or if protected.
"There being a clear classification between what is 'general wear and tear' to a property, and what is not. "
Holding tenants accountable for any damages to a property.
"Property management - seem to work more for the home owner than the tenant. I would like to see clearer time frames when dealing with maintenance issues within the house. Currently an issue reported has to go through the property manager then a quote is needed for the work, then the owner needs to ok the work (but only if the quote is ok, sometimes another quote is requested) and then we need to book in a time (usually inside working hours, so time off needs to be approved). This process is archaic - the property manager should be responsible for all of these issues and book in the work and let the worker into the house etc.. 
As tenants we pay a premium due to the property manager charging a premium for their role onto the owner - So as a tenant we end up paying for a useless middle man that we have to organise all the work to be done anyway? So in answer - regulate the property managers."
Make the tennant financially responsible for damages they cause to the property by negligence or lazyness.
"More pet friendly options. I recently took a house because it was the only pet friendly option I could find and it was not a nice place to live at all. I have 2 small old dogs and 2 cats and every agent treated me like I was a criminal. When I left that house, I got all my bond back and the owners said they had never seen the house so clean or well looked after. But agents treat you badly if you have pets."
Transferrable bonds to make moving easier
Eviction times and documentation
"Improved responsiveness of real estate agents. 
Allowing all rentals to have pets without prior approval from the owner/real estate agent. "
Repairs done in a timely manner
Receiving water bills when they are sent not 6 months down the track and then getting two bills at once
"Repairs & quotes to property are managed by rental agency.  As tenant, they pass off organising access for multiple vendors for multiple quotes to the tenant.  This is what the agent is paid for.
The vendors also arrive to do repairs, realise there is additional problems and do not have authority to undertake additional repairs.  Further disruption to tenant."
"Consideration for responsible tenants and their choice to have pets. Pets have become so common as members of family for different people that it really feels like discrimination to be denied a rental or not have access to rentals available due to pets or staying 'small pets only' as an option. small isnt the issue, responsible owners with a calm animal and good rental history is important "
"Places are not usually maintained properly and almost always have cockroaches and ants. I've also had several property agents incorrectly fill out the entry forms, where the state of the property is definitely not accurate. My current one even got the entire type of stovetop incorrect, which makes me wonder if it was even checked at all."
Faster response to maintenance issues.
"The process of renting a unit in QLD was painful for me. The real estate agents I dealt with took too much time to process my application though I had everything ready at that time. Moreover, the agents required an Australian references for my application and I had just arrived to the country at that time. Also the agents take a lot of time to do the background check that makes the process unclear and not transparent. One of the agents kept lieing to me and ignored me and never got back to me by neither accepting or declining my request. "
Allowing bonds to be transferred.
"I'm a good tenant, i pay my bills on time and keep the place clean and tidy. However, the real estate agent doesn't look after me - i had problems with vandalism and after 3 police incidents and begging to leave my lease the only offer i had from the real estate agent was to have video cameras installed. This can't be right. "
Claim more for damage and costs that occur during rental period.
Being able to paint the walls & hang pictures.  Make it feel more personal.  
Pets allowed in any rental.
There should be more inplace for tenants when the owners of a property refuse to do maintanance as i breached the previous owners and real estate twice over major leaking roofs and other problems and nothing happened and was told pretty much to pay to take them to court by the rta
That tradesmen respect privacy and that agencies protect tenants by not giving tradesmen keys unless they are definitely entering on the day they state rather than anytime they like 
Response from real estate 
Renters to have more control over their living environment
Allow to live like normal and put family pictures up and do things you would if it was your home
Property Managers need to keep Property Owners informed of issues/repairs to the property.  Property Managers do not hand over a property that needs repairs and not secure et.
When the landlord gives you notice that they will not be releasing the property due to the property being put up for sale.  If the tenant finds a place prior to the term ending they should be released.  
Make it a bit easier for first time renters as I found it very difficult even though I was in my thirties 
Agents to be a lot more responsible in their contractual obligations 
Give the landlords equal favour to the tenants. Same notification periods etc!
Being able to put my airer on my balcony to dry clothes so as not to use the dryer as some clothes cannot be dried using a dryer. 
"Making it easier to get into a rentals for low income earners, affordability"
Inspection periods consistent with tenant record. Repercussions for lessors who do not attend to maintenance efficiently. Rent reductions for long term tenants and in line with decreased market value and state of property. Ability to transfer bond between properties. 
Too many house inspections when u are a good tenant. May after 12mths after being with a real estate and u show no damage ect they can change the back to every 6 mths like they use to
"Higher standards of what’s acceptable to be rented 
E.g mould standards, and places shouldn’t be rented that are severely dilapidated.
Also too many landlords try to force you to pay for wear and tear at the end.
Photographs at rental inspections shouldn’t be allowed without written consent."
"1. There should more flexibility in the contract to allow minor modifications like putting a nail/screws to hang items or secure furniture.

2. There should be some clauses in the contract that obliges the owner to repair/upgrade certain features/items in the property that may still be working/use-able/safe but cosmetic/aesthetic have deteriorated beyond reasonable.   "
One thing I feel whould make it easier is if all real estates let you use the same forms
"The quality at which some of the rentals are built at, because we as renters don’t always get our bond back because of damage which is not necessarily our fault and also could have been prevented with better quality supplies.
"
Property inspections to be no more than 2 times per year.
Better contact with the agent
"Some real estates treat you like you are beneath them
Some respect would be nice"
How i ended a rental due to escaping domestic violence
"The ability to break the lease for safety/security reasons. We were recently sent a lease renewal 2 months in advance of the current lease ending. After signing the renewal, events i our street mean that we are no longer safe living here but have been told we are locked into the new lease."
Security and privacy of the unit. The landlord appears responsive to requests but action is poor; promises common
"The removal of Property Management companies charging tenants to pay their rent via a payment system, especially when it is not stated in the original rental advertisement. Also with regards to these systems, the ruling of when rent leaves your account is when rent is paid i adhered too by the property managers.  "
"Rental Bonds. I am both a landlord and a tenant, and I feel like they are a poor system on both sides of the coin. I feel as a landlord the bond is insufficient to cover any real damage costs, and as a tenant I feel like they can be withheld without just cause, and it is difficult to find the $1500+ to put up for bond - particularly when changing from one property to another as your bond is withheld when the new one is required. I think some sort of insurance scheme would be better, maybe one that is incorporated within the rent, so just like contents insurance the rent pays for a premium that covers for damage. The worse the tenants rating, the more expensive the premium etc. "
The cost of weekly rent and restrictions to what we can do in the property
Real Estates to care as much about tenants as they do about owners.
Give Landlords more rights in Share accommodation.  As if one person isn't working with a group they shouldn't have the power to affect others lives and make it miserable. 
Owners doing the proper maintenance on there places and not saying they can’t afford it
Ability to transfer bond between different real estate agents. 
"1. A reason for being rejected
2. Stop the ability for owners/agencies to evict without reason. "
Not deal with an incompetent tenancy agent
I've often had to call out poor behaviour from agents that contravenes the law
Reduced frequency of inspections and allow tenants to set/agree on sutiable times. Increased burden of proof on the agent/lessor for holding bonds over minor defects such as cleanliness.
bonds to be transfered. it can be impossible to come up with a second bond pluss all the other expenses when moving.
More rights for tenants.  More security around leases.  More onus on landlords to ensure minimum standards are upheld.
Bigger choice of rental properties
Allow for pets. More proactive maintenance program. 
The notice period that either party needs to give to end a tenancy should be the same. Currently it is 2 weeks for tenants & 2 months for owners but this should be the same by either party EG 4 weeks for either party.
More pet friendly rental properties
"the realestate agents most are nasty treat you like crap, owners are to picky "
Record more fully and more openly those tenants who deliberately do damage to a property
Not much I can think of really.
Have better Real Estate Rental Managers
"Increase notice to vacate to 30 days and scrap fixed terms beyond the initial term (ie. sign up for 12 months or less initially and after that, just have periodical rentals with 30 days notice to vacate)"
"Real estate agents should not expect houses which are long term rentals and  / or are not for sale to be kept in show room condition.  Many parents, especially single parents, work 8 hours a day to come home and cook dinner and get children ready for bed.  All work an no play makes jack a dull boy.  IE: why should a rental manager judge a tenant for dishes in the sink, it means the tenant cooks for their family, a washing pile in the lounge, it means the tenant provides clean clothes for their family.  The inspection is to ensure the property is not being abused and damaged and nothing more.  A tenant should not be made to feel like they need to have OCD to stay in a place and provide non stop cleaning"
More opportunity for Pets to be allowed. It usually demonstrates a tenants commitment to looking after things. 
Rent off a very nice Real Estate agent. I hate the real estate agents because they are on the side of the owner of the house. Tenants need to side with the authorities Bond and Housing. Change the way we deal with real estates! They have to much power and pit the tenant against the Owner/Landlord. Real estates blame the owner for issues and I'm sure they blame the tenant for their stuff ups. Don't want to go down the path of bureaucracy but we tenants are being shafted by the Agents.
The way real estate agents treat renters. There appears to be a stigma associated with renting and many agents keep perpetuating this. 
"As a landlord of 4 properties since 1986, I have found that tenants generally do not respect or care for my properties. I would like to see more tenant bond money in the RTA to reflect the damage left by departing tenants.
I have spent, on many occasions,  $3,000.00 to $4,000.00 ( on top of bond money -which usually covers rent in arrears) to return my properties to the state at the beginning of the rental term"
"I would make it mandatory that real estates give tenants 24 hours to address issues on the exit report in order to receive the bond back. Also, I would make it mandatory that a neutral 3rd party does the exit inspection, not the real estate to avoid the bond being withheld unfairly. "
"'-Not enough places accepting pets
-There should be one generic form for each state to fill out when applying for rentals, rather than a different form and different ID requirements for every single real estate agent."
Longer inspection intervals for proven good tenants
Quicker return of bond.
"More freedom for tenants to treat a house as a home - reasonable requests to paint over ugly mustard walls should be granted. Implementation of a pet bond to encourage and reassure more property owners that renting to those with pets is less risky. Renting has been very dependent on the property manager - I've had good and bad. At the moment in my current rental, my experience is fantastic. In my last one, trying to get anything done was impossible."
real estate agents
"Entry reports are a bit of a joke when they're not filled out correctly, when it comes to leaving the real estate agency always seems to find stuff that wasn't on the original entry report.
"
"The process of selling the unit or house - it's invasive / aggressive, and the tenant has no control."
"2 things please. 1. As a part pension receiving retiree, drawing on investments as needed with some pension, the income tests for renting applications look poor even though I'm very capable of drawing whatever to meet my needs. 2. Longer leases like say 5 yrs suit my circumstances, but they are not available,  this needs updating to internationally accepted periods."
Being able to hang pictures on walls or maybe a small pet for my children.
Landlord actually fixing things they said they would
"Make it mandatory for rental property owner's to make some improvement/repair to their rental property on an annual basis without increasing the rent every time.  To keep tenants long term, may I suggest things like, putting insulation in the ceiling to decrease renter's energy costs, putting an air conditioner in the master bedroom or a carport in.  This alone may provide stability for the renters and also the owners. Also, mandatory yearly spraying for cockroaches (unlike where I am at present; rented here for the past 7 1/2 years and never been done)  All costs are claimable by the owner at tax time and as we all know, are generally quite profitable for them."
When we first started renting we had initial problems with getting a broken door lock and a glass door that was smashed before we moved in by the gardener replaced. At the time the agency would not help even though they should have contacted the gardener about the door and he fixed it. We paid and eventually got reimbursed for the lock. After going to the head office of the company we finally got help. I dont know if there is somewhere you can go for help with these kinds of situations but maybe there should be or maybe more information if there is. 
"To be treated like a human being - some renters overuse their rights to repairs etc., so when I have genuine issues (and I have had some doozies) - I am often ignored. Also - privacy; I feel like a second class citizen."
"There is no protection for the landlord and everything is stacked against the property owner as I have experienced and have been told, you can write it off, that is not the case as some times the items were still in excellent condition but we had to replace due to tenants causing damage to the premises."
"I have serious health issues relating to mould. The Landlord should have to advise if there is mould in the house and take responsibility for its removal if it is not the fault of the person renting. Just painting over the mould should not be considered removing the mould.
Inspections should not be as frequent and should be less stringent. The current inspection regime and restrictions on hanging pictures etc prevents the person renting from creating a sense of having a long term home."
Better communication with some real estate agencies. 
"I would be happier with where we live if the landlord would update the facilities. We live in an older style unit that doesn’t even have fans, and the fixtures in the bathroom are very old and do not always work well. "
taking pictures of the things which need to be repaired before I move in. 
That the position of the tenant be given much more consideration.
Making the process of getting bond back easier for the renter
"House to be clean and electric, water, gas etc to all be working apon moving it eg, light bulbs, gas tank full and not leaking, water pipes not busted and drains unblocked "
"A fairer balance and understanding between tenant / owner, perhaps with a recommended guideline of responsibilities for both parties. We have had instances of tenants calling electricians to change lightbulbs! While some tenants are wonderful & considerate, there are others that cause noise and disturb neighbors - there should be some protection against these people for all other parties - other renters as well as owners. And owners have responsibilities as well - it's just that these keep increasing with new legislation."
RTA and tenants are inconsiderate towards the landlords property 
"Less entries. It is very much an intrusion. I've been renting the same property for over 7 years and pass all of my inspections however they still insist on doing them every 3 months. I think that if you have had a number of successful inspections, you should be able to go out to inspections every 6 months."
"Unrealistic expectations on the tenant to alter their own lives to protect the property, despite the presence of a bond. No pets, no pictures on walls, 3 monthly inspections that are intrusive and inconvenient.  "
Bad property management 
Open house.  I had moved to Mackay and the rental agency wanted me to wait 2 weeks to see a place that had been available for 2 months.
Improving renter rights when it comes to bond refunds. Too often rental companies have requested unreasonable repairs for general wear and tear.
Maintenance to be done quicker and communication should be better 
"Faster , more efficient legal process to evict non performing tenants. 
This will be fairer to landlords and tenants who pay rent and behave have nothing to fear.
Bad tenants will have less opportunity to give law abiding tenants a bad reputation.....most tenants are good."
Give landlords more ways to collect rent from non paying tenants. All rent assistant payments should go directly to owner so at least that much of the rent is paid. 
Longer viewing time of prospective premises instead of about 30 minutes and with other possible tennants
turnaround time on communication. I can sometimes wait up to a week or longer to get a response to an email/request.
Have more freedom to make minor alternations to my property.
More communication between tenant and owner. Agents are not efficient. 
Rental accommodation owned by investors should only be sold to future investors to keep properties on the rental books
Cheaper rent in nicer locations. 
"I think living in QLD, there should be a rule in regards to cooling for homes - ceiling fans for each room and air-con.

Also, mould is a serious issue particularly in older homes where the property owner should have a responsibility to test a satisfy a minimum requirement. "
Allowing tenants to own pets and allowing them to hang photos on walls
"Excessive entry notices issued. (17x within six months in my case)
Reduce distribution of keys to various individuals to the rented property."
"Ability to keep an animal (cat)
Legislation theta protects renter's rights and doesn't let draconian body corporate laws over rule and diminish renter rights
A black list for unscrupulous agents
Long-term rental leases (min. 36 months at a time)"
Less unnecessary inspections; inaccurate entry reports/dirty rentals declared clean; transfer bonds
"More flexible with the entry days for the inspections, I would always like to be there when the real state inspect the property.  Also the final inspection before you move out,  always scary cos they try to use your bond to fix as much they can,  there's no clear rules in ""wear and tear "" "
That Real Estate Property Managers honour the binding contract that the tenant signs.
Make it easier for tenants to raise disputes and don't make it so difficult to get out of a lease when there are significant reasons to break the lease.
"Affordability, and allowance of pets."
Ensure landlords corrected common problems 
Less inspections/having people come through your home.
"The agents act for the landlords only. I wish there were agents that offer to act and search properties for the renters as well. Just like in the UK.
The renters have no rights at all - This needs changing. No one offers rentals for more than one year!
In Europe renters have a choice of long periods - in Australia is a year max. This is very wrong."
"Longer periods between house inspections and clearer guidelines around what the standard of clean is.
Is the house inspection just to inspect the state of the house or make judgement on how the tenant lives. "
Real estate agents actually abiding by the tenancy guidelines
Better quality tenants
"Not ever allowing the Home Owner to control the rental. Going only through a rental agency. Unfortunately we were of the understanding that we were dealing with a real estate agent only to find once signed up that we were dealing direct with Owner of property. It is painful as he believes he has the right to do anything he likes.
I am going to answer these questions from the point of us being unhappy with our current rental "
After being in same rented home for 15 + years.i dont think i need to have house inspection every 3 months
Be allowed to own a pet (dog) in our apartment
Put a cap on how long the tenant is responsible for paying rent when breaking a lease (to be the same as NSW)
Greater availability of accommodation for women 50+  with reasonable rent and low bond if good tenant.
Allowing pets at all properties. 
"Landlord or agency ratings to find the best agents.
To be able to treat the rental as it would be my own, obviously with the highest regard to improvement and not anything detrimental."
Stricter rules for owners selling the property
"That if the house is through an agent, then the agent only has access to the rental property when the tenant moves out and does the rental bond accessing before the owner can access the property by themselves"
"Clarify and communicate more meaningfully about issues surrounding references and blacklisting, and make the whole process more transparent and accountable -- and permit tenants to contest or defend against blacklistings."
"Owner's have to keep property maintained, i.e door locks, wiring  "
Learning more about renter's rights and not letting landlords/real estate agents take advantage of me
"Allow pets, more so dogs"
Allowing pets inside 
The ability to choose utility provider within an apartment complex
It would be nice to get feed back after a house inspection. For e.g. if everything is good or do we need to fix anything.
Making sure landlords repiar damaged or worn out items around a rental
Affordable renting price
More affordable rental options for people with lower income 
Real estates ability to claim your bond without your prior consent
Ensure that agents are accountable for their actions.
"we rent and own a property, it is evident that when you rent you are treated like a second class citizen there should be the option of longer leases (like commercial properties). for people that cannot afford to purchase their own home to give them greater security. "
Harsher penalties for renters who damage a property or default on payments.
The agent and landlord need more education to understand the rights and needs of tenants 
"Better Housing,Better Landlords,Lower rent,being forced to move less and more real Government Support for those who where harassed out of the Military with Permenant Disability due to Service after 20 years Military Service I lost my home because of Injurie and forced in to rent and now my Super has been lost as well no where to call a Permenant Home and Lost my Fam and Friends as well and I have done no wrong period."
"Landlords and property managers need to treat tenants with respect.  All too often we are belittled, misled, lied to and otherwise made to feel like second class citizens."
Property management having too much say and control over renters
Real estates should not have a call centre type message services. You should just be able to leave a voicemail 
need more time to fill in the moving in report
"Pompous attitudes of real estate agents, allow pets in more properties"
I would make it easier for people to get a hearing in the magistrates court rather than making them wait for a month or two.
No increase in rent each 12 months after offered a renewal
"I  dislike excessive rent increases. They are a necessity, but should be limited to CPI."
More pet friendly properties
To many short term rentals. Need longer terms. Property managers think they own you and hold the rental against you with comments like we won’t renew the lease. It should be up to the property owner 
Greater security of tenure
Make owners allow pets
Have property owners meet stricter guidelines in the area of energy conservation and efficiency so as not to inflict growing expenses on low-income earners.
I have rented all over Australia including QLD previously. I was extremely surprised and disappointed when told by the leasing agent that I needed to pay a third party to pay my rent to the agent. I was even more upset when the third party was late forwarding my funds to get a breach notice from the rental agent. They admitted they knew the money was going to be last as had been advised by the payment company and yet still sent the email. I do not believe I should have to pay to be able to pay my rent.
Maintenance can be approved without owner input under $500
Application process and inspections
Pets should not be banned in a rental. The renter is responceable for any damage done.
To not feel afraid to inform the landlord that something needs repairing. I know that as soon as I request help then the rent will go up again.
"I think there should be more rights to tenants. Such as more privacy for the tenants, contract lengths and conditions (landlord for example is able to give notice to the tenant if they want the tenant to move out early i think the maximum notice they have to provide is 3 months and tenant needs to leave) but when the tenant has discovered something after moving in and signing the contract then they are not able to get out of the contract unless there is some serious problem but thing is that there might be problems arising after the tenant has signed the lease and that was not discovered on the day of the inspection as inspections only go for 15 minutes so its hard to really pick up all the problems. Or there should be some sort of cooling off period etc.  Also the end of rental agreement etc process is very hard for tenant where i describe it as you fight for your life."
Greater protection for renters when there are complaints
Tenants taking care of a property and being responsible for paying their rent and caring for the property 
Visits by the real estate agent
"The one thing that I would improve is: to ensure that the owner of the property is providing a safe home, that is water and energy efficient, that doesn’t need underpinning, that the windows shut properly and completely, that the house doesn’t leak when it rains, the fans work on all settings, the fly screens don’t have holes in them. 
That the property is fit to inhabit. 
"
"More protection for tenants. In particular make evictions harder for owners, particularly when there is no reason. Make the minimum notice for tenants longer. People need to feel secure in their homes, otherwise it affects their mental health."
Once every three month inspections are too much.  Once every 6 months is more appropriate.  
Owners who actually maintain their property to ensure the home is safe for the occupants especially when you are paying in excess of $450 for the property.
If you rent a place for more than 2 years then reasonable wear and tear should not be taken from the bond.
"To renew the currently closed NRAS scheme which in my case in 2020 (The completion of the 7yr agreement) will cause us financial hardship with the inevitable 20% rental increase. I suggest that it is the low income earners or pensioners that will be the hardest hit who currently benefit from the NRAS Scheme.
 "
More affordable renting for pensioners
Being able to style and decorate the house within reason
Finding a good agency and property manager  who  respond to emails and phone calls with out me having to chase them up multiple times
Better balance for the right of the tenants.
the lengths of the leases.   our land lord has given us 3 month lease's
Timely repairs and maintenance
Long term tenants not having inspections every 3 months
Ease of applying when not all parties in a group are present to inspect the property - there should be an option to pre-apply when only a few people in the group are inspecting.
Better protection of tenants rights
"If tenants are behind in rent the owner has no chance of a speedy hearing in front of the rental tribunal but only a claim on the 4 weeks rent which is no where sufficient to clean the house, pay the tenants water usage bill, get a skip to throw tenant rubbish left behind. Bond amount should be greater than 4 weeks irrespective of weekly rental amount or rental tribunal hearing need to help the owner to get the tenant in arrears to exit."
Be able to have longer than a one year lease and limit the times real estates can come for inspections if the house is in perfect order and there hasn’t been any issue
"Greater transparency in declared interest and the responsibilities of all involved in the rental value chain, from landlords, agents, property managers, tenants, financial institutions providing the mortgage, repairers, various government departments."
To be strictly on realestate agents not to try to take tenants bond whenever the opportunity arises. 
Having maintenance completed faster. Not having to pay water until over a threshold - I currently pay for all of it.
"If the owner's want to sell a tenanted house, I believe the tenants should be compensated for having to leave the house when there are open houses and having to have other people come into the house for inspections. I had the house I am renting for sale for about 9-10 months. The owners had really unrealistic expectations of prices and so even though they had offers, would not agree to sell. I initially said only open homes once a fortnight but then I allowed them more frequently to try and get the whole ordeal to be over. My kids and I had to leave the house with our dog on a weekend. It was really annoying and their was no gratitude from the owner at all. It was really frustrating and a total invasion of privacy and my time and I really think even a token contribution or reduction from rent of something like $20 per inspection would be suitable. Even if I was an owner, I think this would be a reasonable thing. I don't think tenants should be expected to pay full rent and have this invasion! Also, the owners kept changing the managing agent every time they changed who the property was listed with so we have had 4 managing agents in 1.5 years!

Additionally, I think renting properties with pets should be simpler and I note other states have improved this. I had my dog approved and was never told I had to keep him outside (and the agents knew he was kept inside), it was not on my lease that the dog needed to be outside but then the owners asked the agent to breach me (because they wanted me out to sell the house) on the pet being inside. On the original pet application, it said pets are to be kept outside which was a standard application for that agency but it was not on my lease. He is a small dog, clean and really we are better tenants than someone that might not have a dog."
"Real Estate agents doing their part and not passing on to the renters to do.  It seems we, as renters, have to print everything out now and we have to follow up continuously if something hasn't happened.  Also, we have to organise with any service people even if we haven't been advised. "
"Overhaul the rental process. Dodgy real estate agents always trying to make extra money from tenants and property managers who abuse their ""power""."
Better condition of property for the money. 
"Real estate agents do not respect tenants rights i have been a good tenant and after 6 years at one house a new agent took over and she treated me so disrespectfully i told her she should recognize i am a good tenant and treat me better so she said the house was going up for sale and i had to move out then she went on holiday and had her team write a horrible reference for me lucky i am actually a really nice person and a couple of the agents i was looking at houses with had told me what had gone on and i was able to fight and get the proper reference written up but now i am left in a house paying way to much rent just to try and keep my family in a safe area and it all could have been avoided if the bully had of been properly dealt with in the first place eventually after she took everything from me she was fired and they never gave me my bond back the whole thing is still up in the air and i have to some how afford a lawyer to sue its just wrong they can bully freely and get away with it and they know it, the land lord is the only person of importance and the tenant is scum thats how we are treated regardless of being good tenants or not."
"Make it law that an independent body must inspect a rental property prior to being listed to ensure certain health & safety standards have been met such as stairs & balconies are structurally sound, no wood rot, no mould in living areas, locks working etc. "
ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE LONG PERIOD BETWEEN INSPECTIONS.  I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 8.5 YEARS ... BUT IT IS STILL EVERY 3 MONTHS ALMOST TO THE DAY.
To be able to break lease if landlord decides to sell apartment
"More balance towards tenants, the ones paying off others mortgages keeping the economy strong. "
Cheaper rent or better assistance 
That the property manager and yourself go through the house together to do the entry report.
"Owner involvement in renting process through agency.
Constant inspections even after you have lived in the same property for some time"
Open and clear communication between tenants and realtor
The ability of renters to claim their rights without fear of their tenancy not being renewed.
"Give more rights to tenants to have things fixed within a certain time period, more rights to tenants to convert a lease to periodic rather than the landland having all the rights insisting you sign a new lease every 12 months under the threat of ""if you don't like it move out"""
Ensure that Property Managers actually know and understand the Act. In my experience so far the property manager has continually wanted me to sign for conditions in breach of the Act
"'I'd like more rights for renters, i.e.: 
- faster repairs, 
- access to facilities/applicances advertised as part of the property for lease (pools, carparks), 
- ability to hang pictures, limit on open houses when owner wishes to sell
- ability to avoid having to pay the real estate's preferred cleaner (especially when bond clean has already been completed to a higher standard than when the property was let)"
Being able to make it feel like a home without having to ask (IE putting up pictures with screws so they stay on the wall etc)
Right to Privacy & Security!  Landlord agent being able to access premises when no ones home is an absolute invasion of my privacy. Tennants should be given a time frame in which they can choose a scheduled time that works for both them and agents to do regular inspections...IF the tennant fails to attend the agreed to time then and only then would the agent be permitted access
the cost of rent is not inline with pensioners or people with disabilities making it less affordable to eat or maintain health care which needs to change
Exit inspection and bind Bond return process.
That landlords must repair things asap
"Owners think they can do whatever as ling as they send an entry notice. I bet they dont want strangers un their home when they arent there.
But we rent so we have to have strangers traipsing through our house any time they feel like sending an entry notice.
Its not fair!"
Giving more power to the renters from owners who refuse to fix problems with regards to the property and also protection from rental agents who are unreasonable with regards to holding bond for ridiculous reasons. 
Less inspections as currently every 3 months. 6 monthly more acceptable.
Lack of properties that allow pets
More onus on the property owners to maintain and fix issues in properties. Renters feel that if they push for things to be fixed when the owners don’t want to it can affect their rental history negatively. 
Ensure repairs are carried out timely and property is maintained in good order
"Better communication between owners, landlords and tenants. "
Making it my own with pictures on walls
It would be much easier if the managing agent managing/landlord attended to repairs and queries when they are brought to their attention rather than the tenant having to send reminder emails regarding these matters.
"I was upset and unhappy a few years ago when I called the RTA for advice as a tenant. I had just moved in and learned I couldn’t afford full move in costs after promising to pay, In a panic I called the RTA for advice and they strongly advised me not to budge and refuse to pay my landlord. I felt uncomfortable and really disgusted. I PAY MY WAY, and am not a scab. I came clean with my landlord and left of my own accord. The RTA is questionable in my opinion. "

More power to the landlords to cease tenancy agreements for troublesome tenants.
Lower cost of rentals.  The Sunshine Coast is simply ridiculous.  Wages and inflation have not kept up with increases in rental charges.
Process for applications and not judging people on status in society just because someone has money doesnt make them a good rental tenant
I think there needs to be great clarity around entry and exit inspections; to protect both the leasee and leasor. My experiences with rental bond returns has been quiet negative. Both the real estate and leasor has tried to keep bond. I was successful with help from RTA to block the real estate but in the case of the leasor my last experience was quite negative and they kept the entire bond. My understanding is that the leasor does this on a regular basis to most of their leasees. 
having electricity and water in our name not owner who benefits from discounts not us and house inspection once yearly after first year
Knowledge of new construction plans in rental property area
"Pricing should be regulated and based on energy efficiency, age, and square footage, rather than location alone. "
Make it more sensible to get a bad tenant out of a rental property
"the renting agent should be able to have urgent repairs done without having to ask the owner, I have had to wait three days until the agent contacted the owner to fix a back door on the house that wasn't locking.The agents treat renters like they are criminals and it is disgusting."
"Owners being honest about appliances (dishwasher) not working, and actually repairing or replacing prior to tenancy- not 3 months later. "
"Far too much power to the landlord, can be very invasive.
An item that works well in Victoria is moving from a fixed term lease to a periodic lease. Each time I get to the end of a lease, the owner issues a vacate notice as a way to get us to resign the lease in Queensland. "
"Have a feedback system for poor agents AND poor owners - name them and shame them. Other services have feedback systems and consequences for breaching contract, the same should apply to the rental market contracts."
"For inspections to be carried out less frequently than every three months. It does apply pressure to have one’s home show room ready which I beleive our home is. We have received thank you notes from the agent maintaining and improving the house. However, it does feel intrusive and when I inform the agent of maintenance issues they are overlooked. "
"The routine inspections , if your a good tenant extend inspections to 6 monthly"
"We have quarterly inspections even though every agency we rent through indicate we are perfect tenants and have rented a number of premises without mishap. Surely we are entitled to privacy.
I also have a privacy issue when the agency conduct the inspection and take photos of all our possessions. The photos are then ""stored"" on the agency server for anyone to view."
"Less frequent inspections by reflecting how long the tenant has been at the same address and maintained the property in accordance to the lease.
The ability to own a small pet ie- dog, cat, bird without having to have permission from the landlord
"
"Renting:I would like Owners to fix things quicker.

Owner: I would like to have more control over how tidy a place is kept."
A bit more consideration for renters
Better responsive times to fix things that get broken or replaced.
"ALLOW PICTURES ON THE WALLS, MORE PET FRIENDLY HOUSING"
More responsive property managers.
3 monthly inspections with over 100 photo's taken of our possessions is excessive 
better communication from real estates staff 
Making it easy to get some consistent advice from RTA with correct answers before proceeding to QCAT if required.
"In my experience so far, most real estate agents that I have dealt with have been unhelpful and incompetent. I believe they need more training and knowledge of customer relations. "
Have more places be pet friendly
PRIVACY LAWS AMENDED TO BETTER SUIT THE TENANTS! It’s is horrible what landlords/realestates are able to get away with. Absolutely horrible. 
"Our renters are extremely slow and don't seem at all motivated to fix things they are required to fix, so it would be nice if they actually felt compelled to do so."
"Landlords respond in a timely manner to fix property or replace appliances that don’t work. Moved in in September and it is now November 27 and both drier and oven have not been fixed or replaced.
Able to hang pictures or put in fittings such as hooks or towel rails to improve the living conditions."
WHEN A REQUEST IS MADE FOR A SMALL ADDITION  TO THE PROPERTY  THE AGENT SHOULD BE MADE TO FOLLOW UP ON IT  fOR 7 YEARS NWE HAVE MADE A REQUEST BUT THE AGENT HAS REFUSED TO NOTIFY THE OWNER
More rental houses accepting pets
More freedom in regards to making a rental property feel like home & I would also love to see properties maintained better by landlords.  
The ability to make changes to the rental property
Making it simpler for landlords to seek reimbursement for damages over and above the amount of the bond.
"Landlords need to be more prepared to put out money to keep their rental property in good shape and no allow guttering to rust and fall off, fences to fall over and roofs to rust out"
"Being able to remain month to month. Ie not signing a new lease if for eg you are buying a house or need to move but you haven't yet found a place. 
Not having to use their suppliers. For eg you have to use their tv man to install more points. They change excessive amounts. You can't shop around because you can't use anyone else."
"'Holding tenants more accountable for damage to landlord property. The definition of ""wear and tear"" needs to be more widely defined. Use of practical examples would help. For example the following should NOT be considered ""wear and tear"" 
* chunks out of kitchen bench tops
* chucks out of walls
*carpet stains that cannot be removed by a professional carpet cleaner
* pet damage to property

What should be considered wear and tear
- damage that can be repaired without significant cost or time investment (e.g. scratches on a painted wall that can be washed/sanded off, carpet stains that can be removed by a professional carpet cleaner)."
Make is easier to hang a reasonable amount of picture hooks. We’ve rented this house for 11 months and have nothing on the walls because the owner removed their hooks (leaving holes) but the real estate hasn’t given us permission for the 10 hooks we’ve asked to put up.
attitude and knowledge of the legislation
make it easier to have pets (i.e. dogs)
Allowing pets in rental properties and routine inspections only every 6 months
"Lower rentals, with requirements now for 1/3 of your wage to cover rent this is becoming out of reach for those that cannot afford to buy.  If challenge is made for withholding of bond by either party they should both have to submit their case to QCAT."
Try to make the laws  clearer and stop the body corporates bullying tennants. 
Ensure agents are honest and respectful to tenants and their 'homes'
Owners and real estates to attend to maintenance 
"I have had so much trouble being able to pay my rent without incurring charges from the bank
The real estate used to give their tenants the option of DEFT payment through our bank accounts
This method was quick and convenient and did not incur charges however they took this option away so that it was the renters who had to pay their bank fees not the real estates or the owners
The only options were to pay with incurring charges until Tennacy Qld helped me get a copy of my lease
I had been asking the real estate for a copy of my lease for several months
As it was stated in my lease that I could pay through a bank account, I have been able to for the rest of the lease pay my rent directly from my bank account to theirs
however when my lease is up in June 2019 to be renewed/if it gets renewed-I will only have the options to pay through their bank which is direct debit only or credit card all of which incurs bank charges
To have to pay charges to pay my rent I don't think is appropriate"
As a tenant there is little effective redress when problems with the property are not corrected. Better and enforceable professional standards on property managers. 
Improve real estate communication
"One idea would be, based on your previous inspection grading and cleanliness perhaps tenants with good consistant records could have lengthened periods ie. every six months, between inspections instead of the usual 3mth intervals. "
Better property management
Property management requirements
Less inspections once tenants have been established to be good tenants. Improve the quality of property managers
Cheaper rent. And consistancy in bond cleanes
Have free access to TICA or something similar so that people like our current tenant from hell can be avoided before they make an owners life miserable. 
Better trained rental agents who do their job properly and respond to issues quickly. We are sick of being treated like second class citizens. 
Flexibility in number of people occupying rental property.
Nothing very happy with my current experience 
Real estate agents taking photos of every room at every 3 month property inspection. I feel it violates our privacy. The real estate is paid to manage the property and a written report should be sufficient for owners unless damage has been done.  
Less house inspections
Proper Insulation and ventilations and maintenance 
The time limits owners have to fix repairs 
Have  better customer service with the real estate company...knowing that they care about your property is important
"Tenants using Goverment Services to change locks inDV circumstances without regard for the owner being able to retain a new set of keys thus causing financial pain. Totally understand the safety thing, but when Govt assists the tenant to financial detriment of owner is not satisfactory."
Being afraid to be normal due to neighbours ringing the owners and complaining 
"Making decorative changes (such as hanging a picture), allowing pets and having bond pay for any pet damage, longer lease contracts, less inspections provided your keeping the house clean and undamaged."
Ensuring property is clean and presentable for tenant to move in ie tenant can do a pre inspection prior to start of lease and landlord must have property vacant clean and maintained at this pre inspection 
"The laws are unreasonably in favour of the tenants and the arrogance of the QCAT adjudicators towards landlords is nothing short of disgraceful. Rules needs to be fair. As a landlord, we take an incredible amount of financial risk trying to buy an investment property. Our rights are severely unbalanced, That attitude of QCAT is the houses double in value every 10 years so just hold on that long and we'll be more than ahead."
"The fact that every time we move we are faced with overgrown gardens, door handles needing reattaching, trees overgrown, silicon needing replacing and all the other maintenance that home owners do on a regular basis. We do these because we’re good tenants but this type of maintenance is never taken into account. Rental properties are just allowed to get more rundown the older they get. "
"That rental agencies understand that tenants are their clients too, not just the landlords- sick of being treated like a 2ns class citizen and bullied and treated unfairly."
Inspections every 3 months. Application process for rental properties
Ability to lodge issues with the RTA and not through the agent whom seems to have a conflict of interest. 
Improved rental agreements for share houses. 
Unrealistic special clauses being used to intimidate renters.
the Cost is not far off the cost of  owning a home
More support for allowing pets in rentals.
Regulations regarding the time it takes to repair problems in the rental and more regular maintenance requirements.
No photographs of inside the house at inspection 
When moving get the rental bond to be transferred straight away to new rental. Costs a lot to move.
"Allowing Pets, more reasonable rental increases, and better showing times (not everyone can go during normal working hours)"
Renters have little power to change anything 
to allow animals (pets) in homes
The time between inspections they are inconvenient for people who work and don't want people walking through their home  when they are not home. 
"Clear and implemented wear and tear policy.
When a property owner changes leasing agents part way through all email correspondence should be forwarded to the new agent. We had reported several issues broken window, large holes in fly screens etc... when we took the tenancy in one property and the owner chose not to repair them. He changed agents and at the end of our lease we had to pay for the repairs out of our bond."
Absentee Land Tax Surcharge!     A killer forcing us out - We are NOT all rich Chinese!
"Being able to make small alterations for example installing a eco shower head.
"
Ability to hang pictures the same as you would if you owned a home 
More responsive real estate agents
Recognition of the costs put into the house to maintain it or make it feel like a home - eg gardening
Land lords accountable for repairs within time frames
Appreciation for being a good tenant
"More transparency on the owners side. Are they looking for long-term tenants, are they willing to  maintain the property and work with tenants to make improvements, are they in agreement for minor repairs to be carried out immediately. "
The cost to rent a home
Quicker turnaround on requests to owners
The competency of realestate agency's. 
Permission to hang pictures 
I would like to see like In Europe and other countries that you can make your home in a rental property like being able to put up pictures and have animals small if in an apartment. 
"I have both rented and am now a landlord, i think if you look after the property and let the real estate know when something needs attention, there should be no need for change, we fix things immediately when the tenant ask, and when i was renting, things were always fixed when i needed them to be fixed."
Stronger powers for body corporate or onsite management to enforce rules about noise. 
Communication with property owners
More firmal opportunities to seek landlord collboration  - positive engagement rather than having to seek a remedy.
Tenants have a fairer rights 
"The owners would have to prove why the rent has been increased,  particularly if you have lived there for some time and no improvement has been made."
Agents should not be able to come every 12 weeks. It is an invasion of privacy 
Looking at how a person has always paid their rent of whatever amount they have chosen rather than dictate what they can/cannot afford
The general vagaries of the responsibilities of each party make it very questionable as to who is truly responsible for what. It is difficult to know if property managers are being honest and forthcoming or if the property owner is truly the reason for delays or absences of action.
"The allowance to own a pet, even if it’s only allowed to be outside."
Interest should be paid on our Bond. Several $1000's of dollars held for years and no interest paid.
The real estate calling you back
Landlords rights to be more openly considered
"Tenants ability to make there rental feel like a home

I shouldnt need to submit a request to hang a picture"
"Increased options for paying rent.

Remove third party organisations receiving rental payments and forwarding to agency. Increases in back charges have risen from $0.85 to $2.00 for BPAY.....unacceptable as these costs are related to their business models and are tax deductable.

Tenants are forced to pay for bank chargers for the privilege of paying rent!"
"Being able to personalise my home more...... restrictions for putting up pictures, etc, on walls is too strict...... IF I abided by the ""rules"" I would be living in a house with NOTHING on the walls... and the walls are usually painted white/light cream...... I feel like I'm living in a fridge."
Quicker response from rental agency
"At the end of each year, they try to put the rent up"
Empowering tenants so they feel there is some way they can produce themselves from property managers who are clearly not acting in their interests and neglectful landlords. 
The lenght of tenancy if I want to break it up it is costly. It should be a little flexible
During continual open houses while the property is for sale there should be a discount on rent as we continuously pay rent during these times it isn’t our home
have more long-term rentals available at reasonable prices
No restrictions on pets and minor things like allowing to have pictures on the walls.
At times tenants are made to feel second class
Landlords should not be able to hold rental inspections for new tenants prior to the current tenant lease expiring. If the landlord wants to show the property to a prospective new tenant financial compensation must be paid to the existing tenant; the compensation should not be able to be negotiated out of to protect the tenant from being bullied into allowing the inspection by the Property Manager or Landlord. The compensation could be 25% reduction in rent payable for each inspection time conducted. Only exception to the compensation is if the tenant is more than a week behind in rent and hasn't been given sufficient notice to bring the rent arrears up to date.
Having rental agents actually care about what you have to say instead of you just being their source of income
More accountability and overwatch on landlords and property managers
The way that real estate businesses are required to engage with renters. We are often treated with contempt and have very little ability to influence outcomes.
"As a person who rents I would like to see a body formed to oversee properties when tenants move out. As a tenant who takes pride in their home and garden I am sick of being treated like I'm one of those tenants who leave a property filthy and in a state of disrepair. It seems to me that it doesn't matter if you're the perfect tenant you still get treated like your one of those people you see on a current affair. An example of this is the last house I rented when I moved in it was filthy, the carpets stunk and the oven was disgusting. The property manager told me that this would be cleaned however the day I moved in it was clear that nothing had been done. I wrote on my entry condition report that I wouldn't be cleaning the house when my tenancy was finished but five years and a different real estate agent later, I had to clean that house and still had to fight to get my bond back. The real estate agents won't transfer bonds nor will they accept bond transfers so you have to pay out thousands of dollars all the while your at the mercy of a power hungry property manager who knows the only recourse you have is to take them to court. Most people can't afford to wait and as a consequence have to play this cat and mouse game of who's got the power? My friend spent 3 weeks scrubbing her unit that she had shared with her adult sons for seven years. She washed the walls, curtains, windows, gernied the walls outside and had the carpets shampooed. She was made to return to that unit to put the plug back in the sink, to sweep the grass clippings off the floor ( put there by the real estate tradesman) and to wash a small mark off the wall, a mark that neither her or the next door neighbour could find. The other property manager congratulated her on leaving the unit in such a spotless condition saying that they would never have known she lived there with her sons for seven years. This is the type of nonsense tenants have to deal with every time they move out. It's very worrying to say the least and ultimately so unnecessary. "
"More rights and privacy for tenants, as well as longer lease terms."
Allow pets especially for singles. Reduce number of inspections after 12mths they are currently set for 3mth intervals. Allow tentants to secure furniture to walls for child safety.
Being able to get a longer lease than 12 months.  A long term leas would give us security.
"Change the rental periods to be longer so one has more security.
Add more rights to the renters when landlords break lease to be held financially accountable in the same way renters are held financially liable."
"4 weeks notice to vacate for landlords instead of 2. Aligns with landlord current notice period and therefore fairer. As landlord, would also be prepared to agree to say one entry for re-renting in first two weeks, but same rules of access apply for last two weeks."
"The agent responsible for the property has not been helpful and totally ignorant when the tenants report about the problems within the property such as refrigerator is not functioning well, damage due to repair job done in the property, and no arrangement of accommodation when the repair job to fix the water leakage and damage parts was conducted in the property.  "
"Pets allowed, minor changes (hooks etc) allowed"
Give tenants more rights. 
Rentals to be more open to pets 
"Landlords should have a bond so if something needs fixing yournot waiting forever for them to get them fixed.
Really differcult to rent house when you have pets would like the law to change where there is no discrimination against pet owners. "
"Property Managers, biggest problem in the industry. "
"Should be able to rate the property agent company for their performance (eg. response rate, communication, etc).
"
"The Real Estate agents are discourteous and incompetent. The one thing I'd change is: the agents must have the property ready for occupation on the day the lease starts. This includes providing all keys {garaage door openers, sliding gate openers}, having the pool cleaned, smoke alarms tested, garden mown and bins emptied. The landlord should not enter the property on this day, and the property should not be left unlocked, with the upstairs front door open. If any of these things occur, the REAgent should be fined and their agency placed on a government register rating them accordingly. This register should include their conduct over repairs, particularly emergency repairs, their communication and their conduct during inspections. If they rate poorly, the public should be able to see. This would make the REAgents improve their behaviour and treatment of tenants."
Make it easier for unsuccessful applicatants to get feedback as to why they aren’t being accepted.
Mandatory disclosure of water damaged and mould affected buildings history
"don't let so many landlords ban pets
don't let landlords kick you out because you request maintenance
improve renters instability
stop property managers from power tripping
give property managers power to kick out crap tenants in flats that are chronically disturbing everyone else
don't presume that a low income earner wouldn't diligently pay most of their earnings on rent each week, let us into the rental market.
Stop doing inspections every 3 months, especially for long term tenants, how are we supposed to feel at home?
We should be able to put a bloody picture up without going through three people for permission like slaves."
A little more flexibility on what you can do when living in the house. Esp if your a long term tennant.
Have some way of making bond payment to the RTA compulsory/ avoid the ability for landlords to keep the bond and not pay it to the RTA.
"To be able to do minor renovations, paint etc. Share cost or rent holiday if paying myself"
Application process - it is too invasive.
"Lower rent
Remove the owners right to not terminate or not extend the rental agreement unless there is breach of rental agreement or the property is being sold

"
"Property Managers ensure that everything is in good working order and have seen the property itself before advertising. Make them legally sign it off as fit for purpose.
Make landlords put their own bond in place to ensure required work is promptly carried out and top it up as required for future repairs. "
"Making it less stressful, and humiliating experience. To have to prove you are the world's best people just in order to secure a home."
"ANY visits to the property should all be conducted on the same day.  It is invasive when having lived in the same property for 6 years we still endure 3 monthly visits, as well as termite inspections, smoke alarm inspections and most recently a valuer accompanied by the property manager. It feels like invasion not inspections.  I must add that our rent is always in advance and we have not caused any damage to the property. Our previous property had even more invasions with the property manager and the OWNER. The owner owned the property next door and then even went on to buy the property behind. We felt like we had no privacy.  Whenever the property manager came in, so did the owner, and they came in more than on their quarterly inspections. It's ridiculous. Where is our peaceful enjoyment? 

The RTA website changed from being useful for tenants to being owner focussed. We used to be able to find information to help us but now everything is stacked against us until it goes to small claims court, at which point a judge often rules in favour of the tenant as the owners and property managers have gone power mad. "
"Make real estates more accountable to their actions. The girls working at real estate agents are usually young, unprofessional, have attitude, and seem straight out of high school and to be honest not qualified for dealing with the sensitive nature of people's lives and living conditions. They make mistakes and brush them off as if its ok and sometimes what they do can have great impacts on the renters. E.gs, allowing a fire alarm inspection contractor into my apartment without notice first so he arrived and I had confidential work documents at home - heaven forbid I was home alone at the time as a solo female renting! When I needed a second key for the apartment the real estate agent advised I had to chase Body Corporate because ""body corporate were not talking to us"" when it is clearing what they are employed to do - palming off work to renters because they can get away with it. I had a friend who received teenage style attitude from a real estate agent because repairs on the property were overdue and continually promised - real estate agents do not have a 'manager' that we can escalate complaints to making it difficult to pass on feedback. "
I am happy with my current rental.
"Out of all the agents we have rented with, we have conducted very thorough inspection with photos and written reports, Every agent had claimed for pre existing damage that was noted, photographed and contested, We were forced to pay companies for services such as pool maintenance were were forced to pay exorbitant prices for things we were happy to conduct ourselves.
Being treated like criminals by agents, forcing us to pay for maintenance, We had a tree fall down on the house and we had to pay for the removal and the expenses involved. Upon contacting the RTA it was 5 weeks before we had a response and we had to cover the costs to access our house"
The ability for neighbours to raise serious allegations and actions.to be taken by Property Managers
"Greater freedom to make the property a home, not just a place to live. In particular, the freedom to ask for and neogtiate for changes without fearing rent increases or contract terminations. "
Not needing to sign a lease prior to viewing for new residents
Make the agent provide rental receipts for rent paid instead of just recording it on a ledger and have the agent acknowledge payment being received.
Improving the viewing experience at the beginning. How to become aware when a property is first available. 
Terrible customer service provided by real estate agents towards tenants. Any other industry/business would last 1 month with the way they operate. Unfortunately they know they have the power as non home owners MUST deal with them. They need external audits to keep them accountable.
Have public housing for Australian residents only if only 1 or 2 people in public housing move them to a unit and put a family in it 
"PRIVACY!!!!!!!!! WHY ARE PROPERTY MANAGERS, REAL ESTATE AGENTS AND LANDLORDS ALLOWED TO COME INTO A PROPERTY THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO CAL MY HOME AND TAKE AS MANY PHOTOS AS THEY WANT AND OF WHATEVER THEY WANT?????!!!!!!!! THIS IS AN INTRUSION!!!!!!  A BLATON INVASION OF PRIVACY. AND NOW IN THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER ROUTINE INSPECTIONS WHICH I MIGHT ADD HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THEY CAN COME IN AND VIDEO INSIDE THIS PROPERTY I'M SUPPOSED TO CALL HOME. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE NEW AGE PEEPING TOMS. I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE PRIVACY OF MY BEDROOM OR MY BEDROOM. IN ONE PROPERTY THERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 50 & 60 PHOTOS TAKEN. WHEN I OBJECTED TO THESE PHOTOS BEING TAKEN I WAS TOLD IF I DIDN'T LET THEM TAKE THESE PHOTOS I WOULD BE GIVEN NOTICE TO LEAVE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. OVER 18 MONTHS I PAID CLOSE TO $30,000 IN RENT WAS NEVER LATE PAYING RENT AND THERE WAS NOT ONE ISSUE WITH CLEANLINESS OR REPAIRS. ONCE I LEFT THAT HOUSE SAT EMPTY FOR 6 WEEKS!!!!!!! HOW CAN ANYONE CALL WHAT PROPERTY MANAGERS, OWNERS AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS ARE DOING COMING INTO WHERE SOMEONE LIVES TAKING PHOTOS INSIDE OVENS, WALK IN WARDROBES, DISH WASHERS, OF RENTERS PRIVATE PROPERTY, HOW CAN ANYONE JUSTIFY THIS!!!??? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN HOME????!!!! WHETHER YOU ARE RENTING OR OTHERWISE. THE REALITY IS I PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR FOR SOMEONE TO COME IN AND INVADE MY PRIVACY........ I TOOK THE PROPERTY MANAGER TO COURT THAT TOOK THESE PHOTOS AND WAS AWARDED $20. THIS ISN'T A HOME IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE YOU KEEP YOUR BELONGINGS.
I'VE WRITTEN TO MICK DE BRENNI AND THE PRIVACY COMMISSIONER AND HAD A LESS THAT SATISFACTORY RESPONSE. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE THAT RENTERS ARE TREATED THIS WAY AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE. I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE PRIVACY OF WHERE I SHOWER OR MY TOOTHBRUSH THIS IS HOW ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING OWNERS OF RENTAL PROPERTIES ARE THEY WON'T EVEN GIVE RENTERS THE PRIVACY THEY ARE PAYING FOR.
I HAD A ROUTINE INSPECTION TODAY AND SHE TOLD SHE WAS TAKING PHOTOS TO SHOW THE OWNER IT WAS ALL NEAT AND TIDY. SO IN ACTUAL FACT WE HAVE HOUSE WORK INSPECTIONS!!!!!! EVERY 3 MNTHS THEY COME IN AND SEE HOW WE ARE KEEPING HOUSE!!!!!!!
SO TELL ME WHEN IS THIS GOING TO START HAPPENING TO EVERYONE!!!??? HOW WOULD MICK DE BRENNI LIKE IT IF SOMEONE WAS COMING AROUND EVERY 3 MONTHS TAKING PHOTOS OF WHAT EVER THEY WANT AND INSPECTING THEIR HOUSE WORK???!!!! BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THAY ARE DOING. THERE IS NO WAY ANYONE CAN CALL A PROPERTY THIS IS HAPPENING TO A HOME!!!!! NO WAY. THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN HOME DOES NOT EXIST FOR RENTERS.
I CAN UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, A HOLE IN THE WALL, A BROKEN WINDOW, A REPAIR THAT NEEDS ATTENDING TO BE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO RENTERS PRIVACY IS ABSOLUTLEY DEGRADING AND THEY ARE BEING TREATED LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. DON'T WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS TO PRIVACY AS SOMEONE THAT IS BUYING A HOME!!!???? DON'T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY!!!!?????     "
Limited number of houses a property manager can manage
Less frequent inspections and intrusions 
"Rta should not give general advice when full detail are unknown, as most tenant or landlord only give the information they want which does not reflect the whole situation. which cause more conflict about whom responsibility. "
Increased ways to make Landlords follow tenancy rules.
More choices of rentals that are pet friendly as I have a dog 
The property manager to sort out issues quicker and stop blaming the owners.
Owners to do upgrades when you’ve been a long term renter who looks after their house as if it were their own
"Make property owners carry out repairs (and respond to requests) within a required timeframe, or tenant can withhold rent until it is fixed. For example, I waited over a year for my oven to be fixed."
"The lopsided and unreasonable power realtors have over an exiting tenant regarding the exit inspection. I mean we just recieved a series of photos of how poor the condition of the house was. In one of the photos we received a picture of ""fluff on the carpet"". In another photo we recieved a picture of a""plastic bag"" left in the garden shed. Im sorry but this is beyond unreasonable. Especially goiven the inspection was done without our knowledge and 5 days after we moved out."
Pets need to be considered as family members. Routine inspections don’t have to be every 2-3 months unless there are consistent issues at the problem. If the tenant looks after the property well then every 6 months is sufficient 
Reduced frequency of 3monthly inspections for tenenats who have proven they are looking after the property.
Nothing at this stage but previous rentals taking long to have things fixed 
Affordability and price of bond. Too expensive 
when you are paying $700.00 a week rent whilst you build your home you should not have a jrn rental inspector treat you like your in housing commission and even though the house is immaculate still need to find something to make reference to....
"Limit on price increase in dollars & frequency. 

"
Owners having to put money into a trust account for emergency repairs so that money is available for repairs when required rather than waiting for the owner to have funds available 
real estates power over tenants.
There needs to be a CODE OF CONDUCT implemented for Real Estate Agents. The self governing thru REIQ needs to stop. There MUST be accountability by Real Estates and qualifications are a MUST for property managers.
"Renters need to have more say in when realestate agents and/or tradespeople come inside the renters house. They come whenever they want and that isn’t really fair, especially when renters actually go to work..."
More response to faults and requests
Make it easier for tenant's to contact owners or property managers. Better communication between everyone involved. Also allow tenant to have pets. If the pet damages the house just take it from the bond like you would with other damage.
make bonds transferable from existing bond to new rental so you don't have to come up with large amounts of money to rent a new house
Stop rental agencies and or landlords using methods of payments that require payment as well.
Letting tenants keep cats & reasonably sized dogs
"Setting up direct debit or other scheduled rental payent system without any fees.  I have to either pay by cash or pay $1 per scheduled payment.  I get paid weekly so would like to pay rent weekly but that is $52 down the drain, so I pay fortnightly, still $26 not in my pocket."
"Time limits for landlords to increase rent - make them provide a reason as to why they are increasing it if it is under a year since first moving in, to avoid arbitrarily decided price increases.
More rights for tenants in QLD, follow in the footsteps of VIC and allow tenants to make minor modifications such as hanging pictures in a property without obtaining permission from a landlord. As a pet owner, also allowing tenants the right to keep pets would go a long way."
Requested repairs would actually be made.
Easier forms to fill when applying to rent. 
change the 3 monthly inspections to 6 monthly. But only on the condition that the Tenant has shown that they are capable of keeping the home in good order.  
Paperwork could be a lot simpler
Tenants have more rights than landlords. They exploit those laws such as the amount of time a landlord has before they can act on unpaid rent or even written notice for entering the premises. They vacate the premises with rent dues unpaid and then the place needs cleaning and repairs. Four weeks bond is not anywhere near enough to cover it. 
Make the rights and responsibilities of tenants known at the time of leasing a property.
Cheaper rentals to be available
Knowing /being able to have some assurance that a rental is long term and won't be sold within the lease period 
Long term leasing 
Have property managers who actually provide the service you pay them for
Not being able to rent with no solid income some people move to an area to source work and need somewhere to live
"Pricing quite expensive,  some places are soo run down and discussing . And cause most people have budgets and cant afford nice places"
Timeframes for when maintenance requests need to be addressed/fixed
Real estate agents should not be profiting from bond cleaners and forcing tenants to use a specific clean (that the real estate receives kickbacks from).
"The application process can be brutal and than they demand more money per week to put you above other applications. I feel this should occur, as you never know if you are being told the truth or just money gouging. "

"I feel for after some bad expericences and being put out by properties coming up for sale whilst i have an existing lease in place
So i feel a it should be regulated that a property cannot be put up for sale whilst there is a lease in place
Being the exception 8f a property owner can prove hardship and needs to sell
Having a property come up for sale in mid term of a lease is very disheartning as the estate agents only care about the commission with no thought for the tenant and having people wandering through your home is not very nice

Simplify process for submitting bonds 
To change the attitude of realestate agents when it comes to returning bonds. They treat you like we are stupid and claim the bond and lodge it 1st leaving the tennant to have to go to court to get whats rightfully theirs back. But if the tennant lodges it 1st then the real estate has to take it to court and pay the cost. The time frame is limited especially if the tennant was not advised. 
All the realestates in Bundaberg every single one because when you make a booking to view a house the realestates either don’t answer you at all or they have on the realestate website saying you can’t view this property because there is no current viewing date: there were lots of houses I could of upgraded to before Xmas but I couldn’t move because not one realestate answered my call/email to book an appt to view a house. This was so distressing. So I resigned my lease to stay in my squished unit😡😡😡
"Real estate are lazy, we had an inspection notice that 'went missing' for 3 weeks and they came into the house un-announced one day. Have had repairs needed on parts of the house since we signed our first lease and still no work has been done.

"The lack of care and action taken to fix repairs. Was made to live with mould growing on the walls and blinds for four years before real estate addressed the situation. The roof needed repairing which caused the rain to come into the house and for the mould to grow on the walls and blinds. I have even had emails from the real estate agent for other maintenance issues writing to me saying that the landlord has no money to fix the repairs straight away. Also it is so unfair for landlords to charge tenants for water when they can claim it by negative gearing. The water bill is in the landlords name and sent to the real estate agent. The real estate agent then photocopies the bill and ""whites out"" the landlords name and details and hand writes the property address at the top of the bill. The real estate agent then creates a tenant invoice on a word document for the tenant to pay. Why can landlords charge tenants water usage but then be able to claim the costs on negative gearing against the rental property for a bill the landlord never paid (the tenant did). It's a tax rort."
more pet friendly apartment/units
There needs to be standards in place for properties. Landlords need to be made more accountable for the condition and maintenance of their properties. I have lived in multiple properties where landlords have consistently raised the rent and never approved simple repairs on the property. 
The option to have a long term lease. Real-estate agents appear to have the mindset that a lease agreement should not be beyond 12 months. If a lessor is renewing the lease every 12 months long term tenancy should be an option. 
"Move right for tenants. 
Bond cleans are more than your bond, if you use a bond cleaner that your real estate has recommended it should be capped out and no limit to fixing any issues they haven't done.

"Need rental amounts to be reduced, it is getting too expensive. "
Property managers need to be educated to actually know what they are talking about and be aware that bullying tenants is unacceptable on every level. If they can't perform basic tasks such as reading the entry paperwork filled out by the tenant before doing a final inspection as a tenant moves out of a property then they are not suited to the job. We were accused of several lots of damage to the property all of which were damaged when we received the keys and were all clearly stated on the entry paperwork. As a result they tried to with hold our bond  but were not able to do so as we had clear proof that we were not responsible for the damage.
Real estate agents treating potential and existing tenants with courtesy and respect 
"More Audits should be done on the Real Estate because I'm tired to deal with some of them that aren't willing to do there job properly. I have real estate that was sending messages daily to my mobile saying that I was overdue on my rent however it ended up that my landlord changed to a new RE (Real Estate) on the middle of the lease and after a month the previous RE didn't erased my name from their system. Now, I've just gone through a end of lease and even handing an exit condition form to RE, I had to contact them in relation to my bond refund almost 2 weeks after, also during this rent I've requested air con and blind to be fixed and 7 months later neither RE were able to do it! Really I wonder why it takes so much for them just to do what they're supposed to! However, thankfully RTA office staff were always a huge help clarifying any issues and doubts I may have, they're the ones saving the process!
Moreover one big thing and important that really should be changed is about pets on the property, it's time for renting have a more flexible rules on that. Like with it's a unit allowed only small pets however it should be allowed to have pets on the property maybe what could happen is if the person want to have a pet maybe come up with a pet bond fee, or even a more often inspection and of course pest control!"
"Having pets at a rental should always be allowed when the rental property is suitable. Renters should be able to make reasonable requests for inclusions, such as the provision of at least one air conditioning unit.

Re-educating Property Managers about the rights of tenants and also actually knowing the rules."
"The rules in terms of Rental Bond from a Landlord's point of view are ridiculous. A Tenant can withhold rent payments using the current rules - 7 days - Notice to Remedy - 14 Days Notice to Quit - 7 days to respond to the eviction notice so they can ""use up"" all the bond by exploiting the rules as the currently exist? If the matter has to go to court to get the police to evict the tenant a ""quick"" court date can take 6 weeks? From a Landlord's point of view the rules don't make any sense at all and the tenants often exploit them."

"Reasonable control over aspects of renting that affect property value.  The following examples include both real life examples where a tenant has made a unlateral change that created damage or risk, and potential future examples if the legislation was broadened to increase tenant discretionary decision-making with even less landlord input.  
Example One: if a tenant can have a pet and are allowed to make 'minor' changes at their discretion (say, pulling up a carpet that has been laid down to protect polished wood floors that cost $6000) then what is to protect the landlord, and the value of those floors (or the landscaping, or other aspects of the property that may be adversely affected by pets)?  For example, at a property that I purchased in a rural area, the previous tenants had 3 large dogs whose activities had destroyed the lawn and garden.  It took me five years to reestablish the lawn and garden (and quite a few thousand dollars), creating something that was truly lovely and added value to the lived experience of subsequent tenants in the property.  I have lovely new tenants at this house, and we negotiated that they could have two large dogs, but they keep them in a specific fenced area of the yard so that they can have much-loved dogs AND a lovely garden, which is enjoyed by the tenants and adds value to the property.  It's a win-win - but it was only a win-win because I had the right to input. If tenants have all discretionary rights over pets, for example, then I would not have been able to negotiate this shared outcome.  
Example Two:  I have a property near Mt Cootha, Brisbane ,where there are some unique native birds and animals.  I was able to negotiate some controls over the introduction of a cat into that rental household.  Again, it's a win-win - the tenants have their cat, and the species are protected.  These same tenant now want to introduce a dog.  I'm not averse to this but there is no front fence and there are (as above) very expensive polished wood floors.  As I (currently) have the right to have input, I am happy to negotiate with the tenants in a way that ensures they can have a dog, and that the pet  is safe, the neighbours are not disadvantaged  (by a roaming dog) and the floors are protected.  If the tenants can just go ahead, what structures or processes are in place to protect my property?  (I have been warned that dogs claws will damage the polished floors.  They were only just polished before these tenants moved in at a cost of approx $6000 and there is no way I can afford to repair them if damaged)  If I have the right of input, which brings the tenants to the negotiating table, then we can work out an arrangement for floor coverings, etc.   
I suppose what I am saying is that both parties should have the right of input and to negotiate- but that unilateral discretion on the part of a tenant to implement decisions which may adversely affect the property seems un-reasonable and unfair.  Particularly as there doesn't seem to be anything to protect the landlord who will incur the costs of repair or property devaluation. 
I sound like a property magnate, (joke) but in fact I am a single woman in my fifties on a low income who has saved very hard to try to build up investments for my retirement.  I can't afford to have them devalued, and I can't afford to repair potential damage or changes.  
There are also questions such as what are 'minor' changes - does that mean they can paint / part of the interior?  What if they have appalling paint colours or poor quality paint that would (again) devalue the property and mean that, in the future, I have to pay to have this fixed (average cost $5000).  
Example Three - Both houses have original heritage features (light fittings, door handles, etc).  One is mid-century and one is over 120 years old.   What if a tenant undertakes a 'minor work' that destroys a feature - (e.g. real life example, a tenant drilled holes in a 120yr old decorative cabinet-timber window frame to hang a curtain, ruining the frame).  If they had asked I would happily have arranged for a tradesperson to hang the curtain rail in a way that protected the wooden frame.  
Example Four - What if the tenants undertake minor works that create risk, e.g. removing stair treads (also a real life example) where-upon the stairs became dangerously slippery.   
Example Five - I've spent many years planting trees on my properties - -to enhance their beauty, create habitat, provide shade and privacy for the residents, etc.  The trees are maintained and do not encroach on neighbours, the house, the tenants wellbeing, and I respond to requests where the tenants would like some changes, etc.  What if, however, I get a tenant who doesn't want trees?  Does 'minor changes' mean they can cut them down without my agreement? 
I put 'neither satisfied or dissatisfied' above as the response options don't really reflect experience - there are some good tenants and some horrendous tenants.  
Example Six - I had a tenant at the Brisbane house who would not maintain the garden although it was part of the rental agreement.  Given Brisbane's rainfall, the trees, shrubs and hedges would take off in summer.  She would not trim even remove the tiny seedling trees that self-planted, or the vines that grew over all, with the result the property became 'infested' with saplings and rampant hedges, etc too close to the house. Not only was it an eyesore, it affected the foundations.  It cost me $4000 to bring in tree removalists, yet within 3yrs, same problem and another $4000, which I could ill-afford.  I had to borrow money to cover these huge bills and am still in debt as a result.   I learnt from that experience.  Now I have a garden covenant.  Does greater tenant control and reduced landlord input mean that I cannot expect tenants to maintain the gardens, at even a basic level?  Who covers the resultant costs of this? The landlord of course - doesn't seem fair or reasonable, really.  
I appreciate there are landlords that may be unreasonable or tardy, and I agree there should be a mechanism to assist tenants where decisions need to be made and/or where they have reasonable ideas for enhancing the property as their home.  I agree that it should be home-like for them.  But the reality is, that 'home' IS owned by someone else who pays rates and utilities and tax and maintenance and mortgages and went into debt to purchase the property in the first place - why should good landlords be punished by removing their input-capacity?  
I don't mind any reasonable change, so long as I continue to be part of the decision-making process / dialogue.  If I am taken out of the process through new legislation then the potential risks to me and  my financial security may be such that I no longer wish to rent the properties - which removes rentals from an already under-serviced rental market.  This outcome helps no one - including current and future tenants. 
PS: where I have indicated 'not sure' below  - it doesn't mean I am not sure about the issue, it means I am not sure about how the question is worded, e.g. what does ""can generally treat the rental property as their home"".  If that means they can tow 4 car wrecks onto the place, let their dogs run loose, not maintain the home and garden decently and allow spider webs to grow so thickly over the wall of the verandah that you couldn't see the walls, kick in the bedroom doors during their domestics, leave vomit coated over the interior walls, leave broken window panes in winter when the temperature drops below zero, and raise small children in this appalling environment- then, no.  (real life example of old 120yr home before I bought it.  Previous tenants trashed the place). If, however, you mean someone like my current tenants who respect the property as their home, and respect my place in decision-making about a property in which we have a joint interest - then, yes. And the reason that answer is a yes is that I worked closely with the real estate agent to find people who WOULD respect the property as their HOME - and to do that, I needed input, even over 'minor' matters such as how the gardens would be maintained and how pets would be managed, "

"Agents represent owners. They spend all their time and resources looking after the interests of owners but there is no one to speak on behalf of renters. They have to find their own time, energy and resources to put their side of the story across on every big and small matter. On top of that the agents put threats to take money from bond in a way as if they can they don't have even justify the reasons for that. Needless to say who is the likely winner in dispute. RTA is a body which seems too out of reach and unworthy to renters. Technically, agents get paid by owners, but, from the money renters pay. Shouldn't they balance their representation?"
"There is a need for a Private Landlord data base or even real estates, they are able to check on tenants but tenants have no way of checking on a private landlord, and some of them can be really bad."

Less frequent inspections
I am a property manager and the vacating process for a tenant owing funds or who has abandoned is ridiculous. Owners and agents need more power to be able to track down and a tenant and enforce that they pay outstanding amounts. 
Coming from Europe it feels overly expensive to rent in Australia. There is no clear reason for the expensive rent. The quality of the building is often not very good.

Longer term of lease for aged people with a good record as tenants.
Less tenant based system. Owners and tenants both need equal rights
Real estate agents need to treat clients with more respect 
More rights to the owner of the property.
"Having the opportunity to have a scheme similar to NRAS for people like me who are single, aged 60 and able who are still working and need not to pay nearly half of our wages on private rentals. We are good, solid tenants who don’t wreck house nor be old drug labs and need to not be at the whim of private landlords. "
Streamlining the numerous administrative requirements into single online systems or a single form.  
"An organisation to hold agents and owners accountable, with real powers to enforce. "
"Discounted water charges...if homeowners want us to maintain their gardens/lawns etc, water charges should be subsidised."
"Fines for real estate agents/landlords when they withhold bonds without evidence of damage to property or that damage was normal wear and tear yet withholding bonds.

"
Better landlord attendance to maintenance issues.
More mental health support for tenants who are not doing so well.
As a landlord I have had a few bad tenants that did not look after the place and broke lease without talking. property Mangers have also been an issue where they didn't know the rules and I had to let them know so the tenants were better taken care off. 
"Longer time to complete entry report. It is often unrealistic to move out of a place, clean it and do exit report and move into a new place and do entry report all in 3 days.
A better (more prompt) response to maintenance issues."
If you have a track record of being a good tenant there should be less routine inspections
Rental price to be lowered to a reasonable price according to the age and condition of the house and wether or not the place is being updated and maintained to prevent the tenants being held responsible for for minor issues which could be prevented through regular maintenance 
Pay rent on time & don't trash the property
Better response to maintance that is needed on property 
"Owners can choose to not provide basic item such as fly screens, maintain the exterior of the property, painting walls etc, if they choose to have an investment property their should be requirements to ensure they keep the properties up to standard."
Better property managers and less property manager turnover
Have less inspections after being in property for several years. Only 1or 2 a year if property is being looked after.
"Stricter regulations surrounding real estate agents (on behalf of the property owner). 
My previous real estate agent tried to bully me into paying for damages I was not responsible for. Although I believe the rules surrounding renting in Queensland are fair between tenant and rental property owner- I felt vulnerable and unprotected. Ultimately, I had to take the matter to QCAT for justice (where the Magistrate easily ruled in my favour within 7-10 minutes). I found this to be a very stressful and incredibly upsetting experience as the whole process was unnecessarily drawn out for months (from first contact with the RTA to QCAT outcome).  "
"More flexibility for tenants to move out if property is sold, without having to wait until end of lease."
I think basic maintenance (like incorporating compulsory smoke alarm checks) should be incorporated into rental agreements. Having owners pay$75 for someone to press a button each year is a rediculous cost that no owner occupied would pay. Costs which are ultimately passed onto the renter through higher rents.
Agent to require businesses to always leave card or other identification when they have entered the property when we are absent.
"The process to evict a tenant , is long & stressful.
First 7days is breach notice generally rent in arrears.
On the 8 th day is “notice to leave”
Next step is court lodgement form
Then tenant gets letter in the snail mail 4-5days.
Court date can be 3-4wks in Moreton bay shire,
Or Brisbane city council 6-7wks
Next is police visit to evict.
If landlord is lucky, no trash, no drug damage or cooking , to clean up..
If not lucky, your in trouble,as insurance don’t make it easy to claim.
Why do dodgy tenants get away with so much.
“Fraudulent behaviour deserves a debt collector??
Con artists- deserve a legal penalty.
Need more support for owners of homes.
Without them feeling supported, many more homeless people & pets.
Doesn’t need to be this difficult, to put roofs over heads.
Perhaps a budget manager to teach people how to manage their money would be a “new course” to train tenants not to be serial offenders & get black listed, ie ticca?
This is still no rent,no mortgage payments,no access to landlord insurance or even bond ,until after stressful eviction, "
Better agents who won’t rip off tenants or promote their side business which is either maintenance or cleaning businesses
"The power of the RTA to play more of an enforcer role rather than a mediator when disputes arise between agencies and tenants.
Agent's have data at their disposal to assist them in making decisions about who to recommend to owner's as tenant's.
There should also be public data available about agent's and their professional conduct e.g RTA mediation statistics, bond return statistics. 
A compliance framework that works off a score could also be implemented to assist tenant's and property owner's when deciding what agent's are reliable and fair to rent from or are reliable to use a property manager.

The laws about pet ownership for renters in QLD need to be more contemporary as in Victoria. Pet ownership is becoming a common alternative to having children due to the cost of living. People are increasingly sensitive to the idea of a pet as a family member, not just an animal. Pet owners understand that damages to a property are their responsibility, so property owner's should not have the absolute right to refuse. 

The relationship between agent's and their cleaning contractors is a common concern for renters. While it may seem anecdotal and lacking evidence whenever a case is put forward that a bond is not returned in full for not using the agent's contractor of choice, feedback data surrounding this matter in particular would show a trend in this behaviour from agent's. Tenant's should have the right to contract whoever they wish to clean a property and not fear that their bond will not be returned because of their personal decision. I would highly recommend that a survey surrounding this topic should be sent out to renters during any future consultation phases. "
I live in a unit of 4. The next door neighbour and family have been given 3 notices to behave ect but still having problems. The owner is unable to serve an eviction notice until it goes to court and then has to serve another 2 notices. I really feel an owner should have more say. The police have been called 3 times.
Equal notice periods for owners and tenants 
"i always feel rushed to decide and rushed to move. Picking a house for a family is hard, but for the nice houses it feels a bit like hunger games."
Less invasion of privacy I.e needing so much personal information and identification and proof of income. 
Law about break lease is too open for misuse by agents. They take as long as they like to find a new tenant and at the expense and stress of people breaking lease. They do not mitigate loss and get away with it all the time. There needs to be clear boundaries spelled out with consequences for agents without having to go to QCAT.
I would not rent. Tenants are treated as second class citizens and have to fight for their rights against owners and agents who bully tenants at every opportunity.
The same standard for how clean a house or unit is even if the manager changes
"If Yu have a good payment and tenant record, I think the inspections should be reduced."
Let people renting have pets without needing approval but they need to inform real estate of the pets that way any damage caused by pets are repaired at the cost of the people renting
the constant every three months checking up and the fact that we pay two months in advance and we forgot when the rent was due and we were sent a text say pay or else I found that very disrespectful 
"Real estate agents treat renters like second class citizens making the process of finding a rental property really frustrating. The application process should be made easier by using consistent forms, questions and evidence requirements across agencies."
"Tenants need to give longer notice when vacating.
They only need to give 14 days notice whereas the owner has to give them 2 months."
landlords hold rights to do repairs in a property and if going through a real estate no matter how much you plead to get some repair done the real estate can not do anything till the owners approval. i consider that inconvenient and causes a lot of stress for the tenants.
"Improve regulation of agents. Lazy, misrepresentation and occasionally blatant liars. "
Cheaper rentals and updated rentals.
"tenants with substance abuse and mental illness that's  not evident prior to signing the lease have a tendency to behave in some cases, extremely antisocially. They may pay the rent on time and keep the house in fair condition but antisocial behaviour by one tenant in small townhouse or unit complexes can cause hardship for other occupants in the complex. There are welfare groups that help tenants find a place to rent however no information is given about the tenants past behaviours. some may have criminal records eg paedophilia theft etc. Its essential to keep the without grounds clause "
"When I place a report that something is broken, and I'm not allowed to fix it myself I would like issue fixed before a 4 month period or ever!!!!"
"rta rules are set up to protect the tenant, more than the residential property manager..
quiet enjoyment ""should"" be for all residing within the premise"
Rental properties should have off peak tariff rates on hot water systems and shouldn't be at the expense of tenants to fund the change
better communication between real estate & tenant 
"Ability to access QCAT in an emergency. Current emergency time is approximately 7 weeks. I have a drug dealer tenant that is threatening neighbors and is now over $10 000 in arrears and costs. Not acceptable. Multiple drug raids by police, yet I get escorted off the premises and can do nothing in a real emergency. Never renting out again."
"Everybody wants family photos on the walls, but we’re always told no marks on the walls. "
"Bond should be refunded if tenant has been in the property for more than 2 years or if tenants bond history has had no claims, then bond should have exemption so tenant does not have to pay. For example my current bond is $1680 & I have never had any claims against my bond & I could use the $1680 for other important things! "
"Better  subsidies for retires ,also prettier suburbs to choose from "
"I would like the house I rent, to be repaired and properly maintained by the Owners. Its an older home and so much needs to be fixed in this house, it's a disgrace. The owners do not care. 
We are excellent tenants. We deserve better. "
"Better service, and better housing maintenance "
Fairer rental prices for some areas and properties.
"Property owners cannot discriminate and deny really good tenant applicants based on the fact that they have a dog/dogs. I believe there should be a proper system where pet owners who have previously damaged rental properties are recorded and screened well. This way good pet owners would still be able to rent. At the moment, in Queensland it is next to impossible to find a property which is dog friendly. "
"Australia needs to look to international experiences to improve renting experience for Australians. Australians pay high rent and the home owners certainly benefit exponentially. Some changes for improvement include less discrimination for pet owners - pets make less mess than children, less house inspections - the house needs to be returned in good condition on end of lease, there should be no need for quarterly house inspections it's intrusive, bond - why not get tenants to have renters insurance instead to properly cover damages and finally, it is unrealistic for the rental property to be returned in exact condition that it was in at the beginning of the lease (especially for long leases) - there needs to be more bandwidth for wear and tear and the owners should cover costs of small deficits to the house as it should be consider deprecation. Big changes need to happen."
Landlords need to protect their property but it takes too long to get activated ok n against bad tennants 
"It is too much in the tennants favour and takes too long to evict tennants if they have caused major damage to the property or are behind in rent. Timeframes need to be decreased when this occurs.
"
relaxing more rules/laws to allow renters and landlords to negotiate freely
"The ability, as a renter, to put concerns directly to the Body Corporate of my Unit Complex. Knowing how to contact the Body Corporate."
twelve month leases too short
More care of property by owner (private rental)
"House inspection 6mthly after 3yrs renting. I understand some cases will vary, but at least those who have not given any concern since moving in."
The process of moving in and the check list.  The check list should include important items such as:  electricity meter reading
Being allowed to hang pictures in properties
Real Estate agents treat tenants as garbage and manipulate with lies and falsehoods to pressure tenants into things they dont/shouldn't have to do
Real estates shouldn't be able to force you into a payment method with a fee when we have so many free forms of electronic banking.
More ethical behaviour / code of ethics for real estate officers
"Both times I have had to endure the countless open houses when the properties have been put on the market.  Having had an expensive time stolen the first time I now insist on being there for the inspection as the agents do not check the identity of the persons walking through your home, they simply ask them to fill out a form.  As has proven true in my case the correct identities are not always given.  Equally the agents do not supervise those inspecting adequately.  The result I loose an hour making sure the house is in good order then another hour every time they conduct an inspection.  This limits my day significantly with no recompense from the agent or landlord.  I have also been a landlord many times so I see both sides but this does not seem right to me."
Recently it took 3 emails to get a shower head replaced. The agent didn't pass it on to the landlord
Rent card systems should be banned. They're hidden (not advertised) fees which the real estate agent pockets and does not share with the property owner.
As a landlord and a Tennent - disappointed with the management by some real estate agents 
"Real Estates/Owners turning up on time to show the rental property. Sometimes they don't bother showing up at all and send a text whilst your waiting at the property that they can't make it. If you have taken time off work to view the property, this drives you insane!"
Improve the ability of pet owners to find rental accommodation 
Allowing pets and choice of electricity supplier 
The bond is never enough to cover damage to the property as regularly the tenant stops paying 4 weeks before they move so there is no money left for repairs.
More laws for real estates
"Have a greater focus on resolving tenant issues and queries. Far too often as a tenant the Agencies and their staff treat renters like second rate citizens.
You only need to compare the manner in which an Agency responds to a lessors queries vs those of the Tenant.
At the end of the day, both the Tenant and the Lessor are paying for a service managed by the Agency."
Property maintenance is poor
The ability for landlords to get away with not fixing things. Coming home to for sale signs after you have done all the hard work of making a place nice after the last Tennant's trashed it. 
"More freedom to make changes to the property regarding outdoor shelter, air conditioning and fencing"
"Greater security of tenure. I have had to move 3 times in the last 5 years, each time because the property was being sold. Were it entirely up to me, I would have moved once in that time, to move in with my partner."
Housing with pet availability 
"1. The price of rent has become ridiculous. 90% of people who rent are struggling, by the time they pay rent they would probably only have 20% of their wage left to pay bills, buy food, buy petrol or pay ridiculous amount of money using public transport just so they can get to work.

2. It is appalling to see That a pure Australian Families who on the waiting list for Housing Commission could wait up too 10 years before, if lucky, get an opportunity to maybe rent house/flat.  BUT IF YOU ARE AN REFUGEE THEY GET A HOUSE FROM HOUSING COMMISSION, A BRAND NEW CAR, A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF TAX PAYERS DOLLARS, ( INCLUDING THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE WAITING LIST) GET A JOB GIVEN TO THEM OR CENTERLINK BENEFITS, AND YET, AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES GO THROUGH THE AGONISING PROCESS WITH INTERVIEWS, PAPERWORK TO EVEN TRY TO GET CENTERLINK BENEFITS.
"
Reduce risk exposure to the renter. 
Capability of real estate agents 
Renting with Pets & Bond Clean 
Being able to hang up Pictures to make our place a home and not have to refurnish walls. 
Make the laws simpler and clearer. The power is all with the owner. The rules have made it easier to pass on more and more of upkeep costs and council rates to the lessee.
Prefer to pay for water separately instead of a fixed price included raising the  rent. We use water conservatively so we are paying too much for water.
More accountability for rental agencies. 
Real estate agent staff had unreasonable expectations on inspections. High staff turnover and staff not competent in regulations regarding frequency of inspections.
More assurance tenure is long term.
Ability to buy and have some ownership through renting for people  who do not have the means to mortgages.
"Letting companion animals at more properties. Uniform payment methods for paying bond and rent that doesn't limit your options and pur people in hard places. Also, payment methods that do not incur a fee especially when there are limited options."
Agency (self determination and supporting framework)
Better communication between us to real estate agents to landlords. 
"Better process for having pets - at tenants expense for damage etc. Ability to hang pictures without a breach notice. More flexibility in power options, ie landlords should be installing solar at a minimum on rental properties where possible to assist tenants in reducing power costs and helping the environment. In sharing situations, it should be the responsibility of all parties equally on the tenants side - ie if one tenant stops paying or damages the property, it’s on them, not other tenants. Landlords should also be faster at dealing with maintenance issues."
"Longer leases and have more time to find a rental. Properties become available last minute for your move out date, which is very stressful. "
Improved communication between landlord and Tennant's to create transparency. Agents often mislead both parties
more housing available for mature persons who dont have lots of money once retired. Not high rise and more modern.
"PRICE!  Availability! 
The cost of renting is insane,  we could be paying of our own house for $100 more a week...  
"
Keep the process/system fair for both tenant and owner and not biased to one or the other.  I feel it currently is and seems to be increasingly biased to the tenant.
Make it law that at least one rent payment method should not include fees (Ie. We are forces to use rentalrewards.com that charges us every time we pay rent.)
Landlords to be more accepting of much loved pets on their property.
A register where tenants can lodge their negative experiences about rental agents who have done the wrong thing and who break the laws in Qld. This way renters can be educated on agents before making a choice to rent through them. There has always been one for agents to put reports in about tenants but not the other way around. Regular audits of agents too would be useful as many do not do the right thing and misinform tenants - especially about how much rent needs to be paid in advance.
Rental contract needs more flexibility.
Longer lease terms. 
As a tenant you feel at the whim of the landlord and manager.
The level of permissions set by landlords or agents when it comes to simple things that make a rental a home. Having to ask to hang a picture is ridiculous. 
Property manager's need to communicate with tenants professionaly not ignore reasonable requests 
More help for vacating a property 
Timely maintenance and repairs
Better Body Corporate Managers
Property agency communication
Tighter restrictions and policing on managing parties and their claim on tenants bonds.
"As a renter, I think we need more support in terms of defending ourselves when it comes to property owners falsely accusing us of causing damage to their property when the damage either pre existed our tenancy and/or was caused by the new tenants moving in (especially if the new tenants are the new owners of the property)."
"Real estate agents often only let you view the property many days or even up to a week later after the enquiry, which makes it very difficult when you are on a deadline to find a new property and still be able to give the required notice period to your existing rental property. "
Communication between property managers and owners. 
Tennants should not have the right to fix the house. The person fixing the problem should be the owner or a licensed tradesmen who is a neutral party. 
Negotiation on lease length and rent increases.
The landlords are unrealistic with bond cleaning and like to try and take your bond for no real justifiable reason.
I am renting a unit..I have a great property manager and a great owner :)
"After a set number of excellent inspections, only inspect every 6-8 months"
Ability to make minor or reversible changes without permission
"Options for pet owners - pet bond, written contract, more pets allowed rentals."
In our experience the real estate agent is much more attentive in getting you in to a property but far less so once you are in and you are raising issues. On more than one occasion we have ended up bypassing the agent and gone straight to our landlord (water leaks) which is not right.  On these serious occasions the reaction time of the agent was poor.
Quicker repairs and maintenance
Real estate agents only care for the tenant and treat renters horribly. 
Allowed to have a pet on the premises
The real estates to know the legislation and owners of properties to fix the things wrong with the house in a reasonable time
"Nothing, I’ve akways been treated with respect and courtesy by landlords and agents "
"The monitoring of smaller real estates. 
Non refusal for pets. Pets are as important as children why are we refused due to pets. 
Being refused homes because someome has gone bankrupt but has a great rental history isnt fair. 
"
"Rental prices, improving property managers and owners attitude toward the investments and occupiers."
Pet friendly rules. Limited availability making it difficult to find accommodation that is reasonably priced and in a good location. 
"Rental managers seem to run on a policy of making it as hard as possible to get bonds back.
 E.g. they purposely keep incoming condition reports very basic and with wide angle photos to purposely hide marks on walls. Use flash to overexposed photos to hide damage. "
more homes need to be pet friendly 
"Making sure I go to a reputable real estate agent. I live in a dilapidated  building (it shouldnt be as it is a beautiful building pre-war era, as a carpenter it could easily be looked after at a cheap rate as well). The communal washing machine rips clothing to shreds, the cigarette butts (even though it states it is a non-smoking building) is flicked all ovr our clothes, we have no respect from neighbours and we pay 50 percent of our income to this dilapidated studio apartment. We are sick due to the dust flying through the old ceiling and have become ill. I would not even know how someone could fix this issue, as this story is not new from a LOT of people I know"
"Ability to apply for homes without viewing - with normal work hours it can be hard to travel to and from inspections inside office hours, especially if the property is not close to your work or you work away. If you can't make the during the week inspections, the properties are generally rented out by the time you find any to view on weekends which is unfair for working singles or families. "
You should be able to have pets wihin the laws of the local council. 
When you move into a property everything should work. 
Lower weekly rent amounts. Decent properties in safe areas are way too expensive. 
The thing I would change to improve my renting experience is tenants having monetary penalties for keeping pets in units without permission of the owner. The cost of carpet cleaning and vacuum cleaner cleaning seems to go up with pets.
"There needs to be affordable housing, I live in a NRAS house and pay 269 dollars per week, This is more than half my pension. The waiting list on public housing in my area is ten years. I also find that as someone with several disabilities that  rental inspections are difficult and expensive as I often cant do the work myself and need to  hire someone to come in 4 times a year to do the heavy cleaning. It is invasive having someone  come through your home and judge you. Thirdly I cant do my own lawn and there is no service in my area to do lawn maintenance. It costs me 60 dollars a fortnight."
Put more responsibility on Landlords to provide a safe living environment
"Actually having access to safe, affordable, reasonable rental properties. As someone on low income, even with a job I am terrified of losing the place I'm in now because there's so little I can reasonably afford.

More pet friendly rental properties- a lot of people have pets as part of mental health care, and putting them in the position of having to get rid of what can play a massive part in getting out of bed of a morning is incredibly cruel given that most pets aren't destructive. "
Was very difficult to find a rental that would accept our small dog. 
Increase in bond money to cover damage
"Being allowed more fairly to have a dog. For example some ads say “pets on application” and I enquired to the real estate about this and they said they only allow small dogs or cats. So what happens to people with even medium sized well behaved dogs?

I believe there should be a legal agreement between renter and property owner regarding any damages and complications pets may* bring. That way the owner is ideally protected. "
"One page sumplified document of rules for both parties that is uniform across all properties with area fforbagreed special conditions.
Noone knows the rules and qcat are inconsistant"
Parity on 'notice' requirements for both tenants and owners
Make landlords more responsible for providing safe & livable houses by doing inspection of rental stock
Make it less expensive
More places would allow pets. 
"Less red tape, more rentals available.
We have a bird and some owners were adamant about no pets including a bird. Personally I can fully understand not allowing cats or dogs because I have seen the damage they can do (current property recently rented has a lot of lawn damage) but feel a bird in a cage can’t cause such problems. "
I'd like to be able to hang up photos without getting in trouble for placing small hooks on the wall.
Transfer list needs to move faster been waiting for over a year from dvol
"Ability to have pets in all rentals. 
"
Ability to charge previous tenants for cleaning up after them.
"More Govt rental housing that allowed for secure long term renting, being at the whim of a landlords investment can mean a lot of unwanted moving. "
"Incentives for owners to install solar power
The ability to have pets or support animals ( when moving out have to have house and yard sprayed for fleas, but no pet !. )
Each second year a New condition report undertaken, making information up to date for owner and tenant "
"The amount of times the building can be accessed for ""valuations""."
"I would ask that there be some mechanism that made real estate agents reply to emails/phone calls in a timely manner.
Some flexibility with what tenants can do to the property (E.g hang pictures)."
It would be reassuring to have a reliable real estate agent that you can trust to answer your calls and rely on.
Quicker return of bond on completion of lease
"Owner maintenance- tenants rights enforced
Tenants to be treated with respect
Real estate agents performance (need to treat tenants with respect)
Body corporate (appalling performance) maintenance "
"Real Estate Agent for responsive to requests to repair damage, and replace worn out fixtures or furnishings"
"Being common place to pay by credit card with low % fees.
 
Perhaps some kind of tired system whereby landlords / property managers can rate a tenant and that be factored in for bond transfers to new properties / negotiating rent increases and negotiating improvements to the property.

Making it easier for tenants to take advantage of solar panel / battery installation where none exist currently."
"More ability for landlords to be able to make a tenant look after their property
Increase the time limits for tenants blacklisting on tica. It was reduced to 3 years recently from 7 years and this is ridiculous as getting repaid by tenants in such a short period is very difficult if they don't want to pay and do a runner."
Our experience has been much better dealing directly with the owner/s. Our short experience with an agency was difficult. They seem to have a single mode of dealing with people as if they are 18 year olds without a history of running a household. 
"'- More rights for renters - including property managers treating them with respect, maintenance in timely manner, not feeling like your rent will be increased if you ask for maintenance"
Landlords should be required to address repair and maintenance issues. Waiting for months or years for repairs isn't good enough. 
Changing the need to gain approval from the owner for every tiny piece of maintenance.
Allow landlords to set higher bonds as the current limit (4 weeks rent) is not sufficient to cover a rent default situation.  From practical experience under current laws and regulations a rent default situation will leave the landlord approximately 12 weeks without rent to achieve vacant possession.  
"As a tenant, I am always frustrated by agents/landlords that don’t address matters in a timely manner. eg. a faulty smoke detector and significant mould damage"
"1. Rising prices
2. Current high costs when near cities"
"This time around we didn't go through an agent, bad decision"
More communication re:application process.
"I am concerned that if there are any infrastructure issues with a rental resulting in additional costs or payments, there are no laws that protect the renter from paying the extra costs. For example, a failed electrical box or a filed water pipe.  The owner forces the renter to deal with the utility companies rather than having the responsibility to repair the item and pay the additional costs."
Rent is too high and building are not standard. 
As my husband was from a foreign country we were refused houses on that basis. We have been forced on a week to week rental agreement. All declined offers to rent should go to a committee to review for discrimination and racism. 
Maintenance on the house while renting.
More professional Real Estate agents who respond to enquiries in a timely manner.
Longer term tenancies for stability 
"More rights for tenants, especially with bond releases.  "
Agree and go over all items that need to be fixed and have them fixed within the first 2 weeks of moving in.
"Consistency with real estates and agents. Real estate agents are constantly changing then when things are wrong they don't know what has happened before. Especially problems on exit reports. 
We have been in one house for 12 months and changed 3 managers. "
Have a pet bond so it’s easier to have a pet
"Allow us to make the house feel like a home, our home... by allowing us to put pictures on walls, have a pet, install gardens etc 
Less inspections..especially if we have a good record with the agency. Every 3 months is a bit over the top... and it doesn't feel right with strangers walking through your home..that's your personal things..

It's frustrating that I have to remove my dog from the property or have him tied up..all day, as I'm at work...for inspections. My dog never gets tied up, and hence stresses...so i have to get a neighbour to watch him at their house all day. 
Talking of dogs...the checklist for inspections is a bit over the top...I once got a cross for the gardens/lawn because there was dog poo in the yard..? Yes, because I have a dog.. For which it was cleaned the night before. 
My recent cross was because the lawn wasn't green enough... we have council water restrictions, i can only water certain days/times of the week..and we're in drought. Talk to Mother Nature about that! Not my fault. 

Inspection times.. just give a single time. Not this time limit..""Any time between 9am '12pm""...or ""Anytime between 9am and 5pm""...9 and 5? Really?..

Mandatory maintenance. I once lived in a duplex where i was told once i moved in certain things would be fixed...never happened. 5yrs later and it's still the same. 
At the same place, the oven broke down...i went 3 months without an oven, until it was fixed. 
When things needed to be fixed, I was  always told, ""The owner hasn't got back to us"" ...after a certain amount of time, it should be overwrited, fixed, and billed to the owner. 

Thank you "
Equal time for Owner and Tenants time frame for vacating premises
"As a landower I feel that the bond amount we are allowed to keep is not sufficient in the event that there is a breach. It takes time to go through the steps and give the tenant time to remedy. In the meantime they could have stayed longer than 4 weeks without paying rent. There does not seem to be a path for landowners to recover any more than the bond amount.
"
Clear guidance for owners who wish to manage their property specially on letting stage to reduce the cost for both owners and tenants
"A different means to get things repaired. Currently if a maintenance request is lodged and the owner refuses to repair my option is to breach the owner - if the owner still refuses to repair my option is to terminate the contract but then I need to find a new place to live along with all the costs associated with moving. There could be a list of standard things that require repair I.e oven, stove, doors"
I am quite satisfied at the moment
"There seems to be no minimum, bottom line, standard home owners are required to keep the rental properties at. I’ve been walked through potential properties that exhibit health and safety risks, and the minimum standard is ridiculous. 
Owners should have a log book they are required to maintain like a vehicle showing they do proper maintenance on properties. And have a safe and clean and tidy home to offer for rent."
Landlords/real estate have too much control over bond return
lack of regular maintenance from owners and timely maintenance 
Longer leases with no rent increase with tenants with no marks against there name and are allowed to pay direct to a bank account instead of current methods. 
That any repairs or Pet to fix essential white goods is done immediately. Pets are allowed. 
"Prejudice with rental owners surrounding animals over a certain size without any sort of background check on the animals.
Poor paperwork kept by most real estates (in my experience, not speaking for everyone) resulting in a lack of effective communication."
Real estate agents who actually listen.
Property managers being more respectful towards tenants and repairs done on a timely manner
Form 11 default periods for unpaid rent. typically agents remit to owners account either montly or bi monthly. in over 10 years of renting we have never not paid rent past the date that the agent remits to the owner however we have occasionally been past the nominal 11 days. thus we have received a from 11 which damages our record and the owner has never been impacted by a cent and has been paid from the agent trust account on time.
Agent's seem to hold all the power and don't always treat good tenants well.
Being able to have a pet without having to ask and then being rejected.  I have two small birds in a cage and had to ask even for that.  Tenants should be able to have a pet for companionship without asking.
both Renters and Landlords need to be reasonable intelligent and not self centered
Bond transfers from one real-estate to another when relocating
"As an owner or property manager, we should not have to give 7 days notice to inspect our property... especially if we suspect the property is being damaged or neglected... This is a huge asset and alot of damage can be done in 7 days...."
Tenants should be able to make minor changes to property that they have leased long-term. Eg. Hooks on the walls.
Having the managers of the real estates promptly attend to necessary maintenance and not treat you like a lower class of person when requests are made
more reasonable cost of renting
"The cost is unreasonable for a family home. 
The paperwork that needs to be filled out for applying for rentals is over the top and time consuming. "
"More certain gaurantee of tenancy. It is still too easy for a Landlord to put you out even after years as a good tenant. Landlords must have a very good reason to put a good tenant out..

There also needs to be a cap on how much your rent can be increased at any one time. Link8ng it to CPI and/or MAWE increases."
"THE OPTION OF HAVING LONGER LEASES WOULD ASSURE MORE STABILITY FOR RENTERS, BUT IF FOR A GOOD REASON THAT THE LEASE HAS TO BE BROKEN, A BREAK LEASE FEE OF ONE WEEKS RENT  COULD BE CHARGED INSTEAD OF HAVINNG TO PAY FOR THE LEASE UNTIL A NEW TENNANT CAN BE FOUND."
Repairs to be carried out & less inspections after 9 years 
"Having repairs done in a timely manner, took 8 months to get smoke alarms, house is in poor condition. More properties to allow pets would make everything easier. "
"Real estate agents unfairly claiming against your bond money, I have just had this experience about 3 months ago. I feel they need to have justifiably explained the reason for their claim, not just able to put dot points."
"Real estate agents/ landlords to do their part properly and fairly! Examples: entry and exit inspections completed in timely manner & thoroughly with photos, repairs & security issues attended to quickly & fairly."
When inspections are done they should be doing a inspection for maintaince inspection - I am sick I being told my house needs a spring clean etc when my house is tidy no damage etc.
Agent's right to enter premises when no one is home!
"The real estate agencies should be more regulated. It is difficult to deal with them cause some dont respond for ages, dont resolve issues and in general do whatever they want."
The increase of rent at the end of lease if you want to continue
Better communication for renters. No bond withheld for things out of our control. Easier to rent properties with pets. Should provide more time for tenants when a landlord wishes to sell the property or doesn't wish to renew a lease.
Have it compulsory that pets are allowed in all rentals 
Higher standards for cleanliness of homes especially if they have been vacant for a while. I have moved into homes that were filthy and when leaving I have it in better condition and cleaner but they still find things to pick on
"The paperwork needed for housing. Also renting in Queensland is good but if all real estate's had the same rules. Across the board even to housing, NRAS. NRAS I have found more difficult. Extra paperwork, really no rights for tenants in these areas. RTA really don't defend the tenant. RTA mainly the real estate's and owners are protected."
I have been in the same apartment for 8 years and have never had any negative inspection reports.  When the new agent took over they raised the rent by $30/week and would only give me a 12 month tenancy agreement. Now every year they raise the rent.  Over 4 years I have gone from paying $360 to $500/wk.  I would like to see good and long term tenants valued by giving 2-3 year leases and committing to not raising rent every 12 months. I am sometimes a little afraid that if I ask for repairs they may not renew my tenancy agreement.  Their attitude seems to be - we could fill that apartment easily so we don't really care if you are happy or not. 
"A landlord should not be able to dictate whether or not a renter has a pet. If damage is caused, that is entirely what a rental bond is for."
"From an owner perspective, I believe there needs to be a formalised accountability process for property management companies and real estate agents that do not act with integrity and manage a property effectively.
From a tenant perspective I believe there needs to be a simpler process to breach an agent or owner, as well as increased visibilty for proerty referals other than the tenancy rental ledger."
"More GOOD, AFFORDABLE 1-bedroom places to avoid all the druggos, unclean and crazy fucks that live in Brisbane."
Having an agent that actually did something when it was needed without having to constantly follow up. 
Not having to tell the owner via the property manager that I will be placing a breach notice to get basic maintenance completed in a reasonable timeframe.
'- Better security of tenure.
Make viewing times more accessible to working people.  Taking time off to go to viewings is hard and sometimes affects your work 
Manner of property managers.
"I think there should be more options when you have a pet. with regular inspections, it should not be unreasonable to own a small pet. It can be really difficult to find suitable housing as so many landlords flatout refuse any pets. 

Bond amounts should be more flexible. It is such a huge outlay when moving rental properties. You also feel that you never get your full bond amount as the rental agent always finds something to deduct. You feel pressured to use their recommended cleaners, pest removers and/or carpet cleaners so you can receive your bond, otherwise, if you use your own suppliers they question the quality of bond clean even though it is a professional company. 
Property inspections are important. It protects both parties, However, if you have been renting for quite a period of time, or extend a lease, the time between  inspections should be increased, unless of course the tenant has had a breach.  "
"Ability to make temporary changes to gardening facilities/add garden beds
Allowance to have pets (so long as any damage caused by them is repaired at the cost of the renter and the house is professionally sanitised of all pet remnants. "
Less restrictions on pets. Also once the tenant has been living in a place longer than 5 years I think the inspections should be reduced if there have been no problems previously. 
"'Improved support for longer-term renters. Og. once a tenant has occupied a property for past a given period of time, they are accorded a modified set of rights and responsibilities
- Longer notice periods on lease renewals, rent increases, etc
- Reduced frequency of condition inspections
- Right to consultation on property modifications by the owner (eg tree lopping)
- Looser restrictions on pet ownership, addition of fixtures and fittings, etc"
Real estate agents who don't believe you when their is an issue with the property.
"Real estate agent knowledge, compassion and understanding "
Longer leases for good tennant's 
Make property owners fix things when required immediately. 
"I don’t believe that every inspection every 3 months should need to be cleaned to bond clean level, these are our homes not display houses. The one thing I would change is having to deal with 20yo property manager who had no idea about living the real world."
The 3 days given to complete the house entry condition report. Its ridiculous when people are in the middle of shifting between 2 houses. it needs 7 day minimum!
Payment through middle company which then costs more than the advertised rent. 
"Better legislative provisions for property owners to maintain and protect their assets:
1) remove ambiguous terms such as ‘reasonable’
2) definition and examples of ‘fair wear and tear’ eg if a tenant drags furniture over timber flooring causing damage, then that is preventable damage due to tenant carelessness, which could have been avoided and not resultant of fair wear and tear.
3) Additional entry provisions covering general maintenance that are not subject to ‘tenant agreement’ but allow the owner to maintain the quality of the property and asset. For example, annual pest treatment; regular air conditioning and appliance services in accordance with manufacturer requirements; minor lot improvements and repairs such as painting touch-upsand and upgrading fixtures.  

It is completely unviable to maintain rental property to desired owner standard under current legislative provisions while at the mercy of needing tenant agreement on non-urgent, particularly if tenants have limited English making otherwise straight forward lessor/tenant negotiations impossible. Also limited opportunities to appoint trades people during annual Dec-Jan close down period."
"landlords not doing repairs that are not crucial - Eg broken eaves and gutters.   broken uneven cement paths which are dangerous. 
"
"Be able to put pictures on wall, possibly some decorating(within reason) at owners approval."
"That the real estate be more proactive with the Exit Reports and ensure they check the tenants Entry Report prior to reporting back to tenants of the repairs and/or issues on the Exit Reports.  Meaning, issues are already submitted on the Entry Report and during Open Inspections, yet the Agents still report these issues on the Exit Report."
"Being allowed to have a small pet,
These days kids are all growing up not knowing how to love and care for pets  or experience the loss of a pet
It’s sad"
"Fixed-term tenancies should automatically, by law, roll over into ongoing periodic tenancies, unless the tenant wishes to sign a new fixed term agreement."
Realestate rental application processes.
"Contacting Real Estate agents is a nightmare. Constantly told the person is on another call or out of office, please leave a message and they’ll return your call...they never do. We are long term renters and rentry recently thought about moving. We set up a inspection time to view but it was canceled due to property being leased. I’m j sure how that can happen if they haven’t had a viewing. Why do you have to wait to inspect a property for over a week? It was better when you could leave a deposit and view an empty property yourself."
Choose my realestate wisely
Better property managers 
Rental managers that are good at communicating and treat the tenants with respect.
Stricter rules to prevent property owners making spurious claims for money out of the exit report
Not feel like a third class citizen or automatically judged to be doing the wrong thing
"Being able to rent a property without having to physically attend a viewing - when being interstate it was impossible to view properties during the week whilst we were working interstate - this becomes a very excessively expense gaining holiday rental to then find the right property to rent - including moving twice, disruption to family life, extra storage costs and the higher costs of temporary accommodation "
Have some sort of tenure and be able to treat the rental property as our home.
"Make having ceiling fans or air conditioner compulsory in rental units
Make compulsory that all rental properties must be insulated in the walls 

"
"I think real estate people to blame, they don't communicate well. They get their commission but do not do anything for either landlord or tenant. Definitely need to tight their industry to have better people working in the real estate."
To be able to be treated as a human during inspections
Improve the quality of Real Estate agents with better trained property Managers who actually know what they are doing and understand the relevant legislation.
More pet friendly rentals and more partly furnished rentals.
"NOt happy with inspections every 3 mths would rather every 6mths 
Especially when you are keeping the property in A1 condition "
My real estate agent is very relaxed I don’t receive a form 9 they send a text to say they will do the house inspection will less that 24 hours notice. Following them up with renewals etc
House inspections less often
"Of course the rent price.
And I got so mad with the first tenant to pay NBN fee rule since the house owner is the one who's gonna benefit from the cable set up in the long run."
Make it easier for good tenants to rent properties
"Renting is very expensive and if you have a dog, I have a small poodle it was so very difficult and very limited properties, I suggest some one from your department try to get a rental property on the Gold Coast,, there is so many applicants and the process for one house can take weeks."
Better real estate agents. 
To be able to ask for minor improvements to the house and not feel worried that I’m going to be turned down/rent increased. 
"The recognition of different legislation in Queensland. For example the Weapons Act 1990 and the Queensland Residential Tenancy Act. 

Under the Weapons Act, I am responsible for the security at all times for any weapons I secure as per the legalisation at the premises which I own or rent. 

Under the Queensland Residential Tenancy Act states that a maintenance contractor can provide an entry time between 8.30 am to 5 pm without a 2-hour window of entry similar to the real estate agent or owner. 

I cannot afford to take a whole day off to appease the legalisation and lose a days wages. I have no issue with being provided with a 2-hour entry window similar to the real-estate and owners after the minimum notification period. 

Also, who vets the character of contractors and their employees to ensure they are fit and proper people to enter the premises of renters in Queensland?? I know the Real estates should but who audits their processes??   "
The price of renting is starting to creep up and become too high. We need to start treating Housing as critical infrastructure not just an investment opportunity.
More houses to offer accommodation for pets. 
"'- unprofessional attitude towards dealing with the tenant
- unfamiliarity with the latest technology like lighting. One instance, my current property manager asking that I am responsible for changing bulbs, which I am pretty aware of provided it is just a bulb only. However, the majority of the light fittings nowadays are LED light which requires an electrician to do install the whole light fittings than just a bulb only.
- not including some or majority of the defects in the entry conditions provided to the tenant and forcing the tenant to accept even though there is missing information in the entry conditions that need to be included
- skipping from regular inspections appointment 
- 3rd party inspections (e.g. smoke alarm, etc) must through the Real Estate ONLY due to privacy and safety concern of the tenant
-  taking time to respond on repair request
"
"More allowance for pets, less interrogation about the property, better communication "
When/ if I had an issue with maintenance it would be good if something could be done within 48 hours. Not a few months later.
Transparency from landlords about  intention to sell the property at the time of lease approval or tenants signing the lease.
Maybe allowing some types of pets and having the houses / apartments checked for livability as some are terrible. 
More options for tenants to use the property like their own home
Improve means by which a landlord can obtain faster satisfaction when a tenant fails to comply with a notice to remedy a breach.
Being able to put up nails and less regulation regarding having pets in your backyard and property
"Agents/ homeowners being held to the same level of accountability and response times as the tenant. I will often either not hear back at all from the agent or simply be pushed around for weeks. It took over a month to have a lock put on the patio door to my bedroom. Often my emails are either flat our ignored, if I ignored an email, I'd be kicked out of the house. 

Also the obvious, prices are insane and there are empty houses everywhere. a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom should not be $50 less than a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom. And no, that doesn't mean bumping the prices up of the larger house. "
Having more personable real estate agents – constantly feel like you're just another number and they never take the time to offer a decent service to their tenants.
"Remove bond requirement. If damage occurs, tenant should pay, within reason. "
"On the whole, I have had a pretty ok experience with renting. I am also a Landlord with one rental property (my home) and current rent. In all the years that I have rented I had one very bad experience with one firm getting renters in with the view of then listing it for sale. They then had regular open inspections every weekend and also multiple inspections through the week. With kids and two dogs this was unreasonable. I had to be home to ensure that no one went outside near the dogs. This firm took advantage of the processes in place for landlords to sell and made our life at this stage very stressful and unbearable. This listing price was set too high. After we moved out, they did the same to the next tenants. On exiting the property, they expected us to fix all the damage that was there before we moved in. Luckily we had photos of this ourselves. There are ruthless rental companies out there. As a landlord, I try not to unreasonable with my tenants requests and allow them to live their lives whilst they rent from me.  If you have good tenants and a good rental manager the processes seem to work well. "
"Land lords and owners take too long to fix problems (only doing so when threatened by the RTA) and not allow pets, not allow hanging items on the wall, and can increase prices for no reason and changing pricing structure without any other choices"
"Not having house inspections every 3 months, it is very invasive."
"Making repairs compulsory. In my experience, owner's don't want to spend money on necessary things like water, toilets and advertised features. If they don't want to they should not be allowed to rent their property out."
"Allow tenants to treat a property as their own. As it is, a tenant must apply with everything from changing a towel rail to placing a hook into a wall. The way a tenant wants to live and/or decorate is 100% reliant on whether or not a landlord agrees with your choices. Old, out dated toilet roll holder? forget it, you need approval to change it to a modern one. Want to have a dog? unless to owner is a pet lover, too bad. "
"Improve bond return rules: 

When a landlord uses an agent there can be a situation where the agent acts only for the landlord. Agents should have an ethical requirement to act equally for both landlord and tenant. 

If the bond return goes to arbitration, the landlord can use their professional agent to act for him or her while the tenant must represents themselves. This seems one sided and to rectify this either the landlord should only represent themselves in a dispute or the tenant has an option to have their own agent to represent them.

In my experience, landlords seem to view the bond as a target of funds that they should have a share. Various claims and excuses might be ""thrown in"" to ""try it on"". It can be really difficult to fight a professional agent from the tenants' perspective.

When agents do their quarterly inspection they should also be required to highlight matters of rectification to avoid surprises at the end of the tenancy.    "
"Rental agencies acting like they care about renting a property. A response to lease applications, even when you are unsuccessful. "
Better support for property managers. RTA = tenants; OFT = owners. ? = property managers
rental inspections!!!!!!!!!  I have been renting for 20 years and have NEVER failed an inspection.  These quarterly inspections are a major invasion of privacy.  Why cant the rules around inspections be relaxed for thos of us that have a proven track record
Lack of more timely accountability on agents doing the wrong thing.
More rights for good tenants with a proven track record.  At the moment good tenants get ripped off and treated as badly as bad tenants.  There's no incentive to be a good tenant and often we seem to bear the costs of previous bad tenants who just accept they'll never get a bond back and move on leaving a legacy that gets dumped on the next poor sucker.
being able to find one bedroom units that allow pets 
"Maintenance being carried out timely and to good quality. Not just cheap quick fixes. We were expected to put up with less than satisfactory living conditions with mould, leaking roof, dripping taps, broken windows and walls "
Have estate agents and owners carry out repairs when they are needed without waiting for months or being made to feel guilty that something has stopped working etc. 
"If you are a long term renter, rental increases should only happen once every 1-2 years."
When renting the same property for many years without any issues reduce the number of inspections to every 6 months or 12 months.  Every 3 months seems very excessive when you have a good record.
Get rid of backlash experienced from property managers when reporting issues with the property.  I shouldn't have to put up with things that affect health and safety just because they start going out of their way to find fault with me after reporting an issue.
"Real estate agents over zealous behaviour. They should be a middle man between owner and tenant, not an agent for the owner. 
We have had a re agent actually forge documents submitted to court...
I had a neighbour break a window, and the re agent told me I had to either sort it with the neighbour, or have the window fixed. The incident was caught on camera and submitted to the police, but the re agent continued to demand that I repair it or sort it. 
Just some of the incidents.
I have owned two rental properties and if my agents behaved like this, they would be gone. "
"Real Estate Agents are becoming arrogant in their attitude towards Tenants; probably deservedly so in certain circumstances. It is intrusion enough to endure inspections but currently they think it is appropriate to photograph your living space/belongings without your permission.
Our Agent is currently again pushing for us to authorize direct debits for payments through a third party. Money, Direct Debits and Third Parties.......not a positive mix for the Payee"
Having more places allow pets within rentals
The rental of properties could be a lot more affordable as most of our fortnightly income goes on rent.    
Having to fork out Bond money when you have bond money sitting there is such a tough stretch. Having to pay 6 weeks rent then moving costs is just so stressful and a strain. I feel the Bond process should be alot quicker.
"maintenance requests need to be more compulsory for owners. it might be their investment so dont want to spend money on it. but if they can afford an investment they can afford to put money into the property to make better living standards for tenants. better the minimum standard longer tenant stays. so much 'bad tenant' on media, not fair for good tenants. need rules for bad tenants to be evicted easier but rewards for good tenants.
tenants should be allowed to do more to the property if they wish but with the extra cost of returning it to the original or better condition on exit."
Higher maintenance requirements for owners
Communication between Agents and owner does not seem to be what it should be. The bond procedure and reasoning behind not releasing bond explained more.
Stop rent prices increasing.
Being able to make my house feel like home. Ie allowed a small pet or to hang a few photographs on the walls
"Renters need more legal rights, the amount of times I've brought up maintenance issues to the real estate and the owner just Ignores it is not acceptable. 

We need a new system where we have better options to get our bond back, my current real estate has taken photos at different angles and with flashes or different times of days just to make out that I'm the bad guy, and I have no legal say in the manner what so ever!"
"Being made aware of the negatives of the property - noisy neighbours, excessive heat of the property, who the complaints are made to -  "
solar panels and longer times between house inspections and more pet friendly houses.
"There is no balance between tenant & landlord rights.
The landlord should not have to give 2 months notice to leave when the tenant only has t give 2 weeks.  It should be the same, say 4 weeks.
Agents should not be allowed to place a Bond Refund form for 100% of the bond without communication with the tenant.
"
"blind review of rental applications. To get some assurance that we would find a house for our family to live in we would show our bank account details - how much money we had in our accounts. If we had some money saved up that would always take us to the top of the list of applicants. But actually this is unfair. Not everyone can do this, but everyone deserves to know they can find a safe home for their family. It's nerve racking when you have to move somewhere else and you have no where to go."
"Now that many people are renting due the housing market prices, renters should no longer be treated like ferril lower socioeconomic criminals. Unless they do disrespect a property or fail to pay rent."
"Heating / cooling 
Maintenance done
House on tank water needs gutters that flow into tank.
"
Implement time bars for response to queries/problems
"Restrict the number of showings per week of a rental property still occupied by a tenant when the property is advertised either for sale or as a newly listed rental.  Maximum of twice per week is enough. I have been in properties where every 48 hours the Real Estate bring through prospective buyers or tenants which can last for weeks. It's intrusive, inconvenient and intimidating.  "
Better communication between renters and property owners/real estate agents
things getting done on the property
Fairer treatment of younger tenants and more leniency to be able to make the house you're living in your home e.g being allowed to plant things in the empty garden etc.
Owners fix issues informed about and not to sell their property while its being tenanted
It would be good to change the house inspections from every 3 months to 12 months once you have been in the house more than 12 months if you haven’t had a bad report 
Have the realestate employees fight more for the tenants rights 
More transparency from the agent and property manager
Better property managers
More extensive tenant data
The property managers contempt of renters
Clear rules/guidelines around bond cleans when moving out. These are very expensive currently. 
I'd like to be allowed to have a pet
A minimum response time for repairs that the realestate agent must come to supervise
better communication by real estate agents and fixing issues at the rental home when they arise
Rent certificate each fortnight would be great 
"Only one thing???? 
The attitude from most property managers is terrible specially once you are in a rental agreement. I have rented from several real estates however this problem seems to be throughout. Things need repairing ect. and it never gets done or just takes forever. The real estate blames the owner / the owner says they were never told!
However, once you have to vacate a property the Real Estate comes down on you like a ton of bricks!!! Abusing their ""power"" marking you down on the smallest of things and ask to leave the house cleaner than prior moving in.  

Also in case I don't get a chance to say this at a later point... the Rental process is absolutely ridiculous !!! 
Why do you have to hand in all your private details just to apply for a house??? Coming from a European country I find this very disturbing!! So much work in filling out all the papers with hundreds of questions. Handing in private and most sensitive data??? This should only be asked from the Tenants who get chosen. If the paperwork doesn't stack up the Real Estate/Owner can still say ""no""."
Regulations for the standards of affordable rental properties. 
"Moving away from paper condition reports.
App based with pic capacity would be better.
Too much room for argument in condition reports"
Ability to have pets without being denied 
"Being able to keep pets and have a bit more authority in our renting experience. We have sometimes had tradesmen turn up/call us on the day after having been organised by our real estate agents, when we had not been notified. We have also often been notified after the fact that someone had come to our building to do repairs which has made us feel uncomfortable. "
More privacy when it comes to renting a property. There are too many rental inspections and they take photos of each individual room. You feel like you have no say and no privacy. Inspections should be done a minimum of only twice a year. And tenants shouldn't have to agree to photos being taken.Current rental inspections are done every 3 months and it is too invasive.
RTA disclosure to owners / agents were  full bonds are not returned to tenants on a previous tenancy.
"The renting rules and stipulations, and allowing extra special considerations, heavily tilt the hand towards the owners. There are far too many property managers out there that are problematic, with no recourse for tenants to complain while renting without fear of retribution. There should be a governing body where all property managers have to be regulated, and problematic ones can be prevented from continuing to work in that industry."
The attitude of rental agencies to renters. We are not lesser beings because we rent. 
how about solar hot water or solar panels on rental housing to help low income household with there power bills
My main concern with renting is the relationship between the tenants and the property manager as these relationships can be difficult when the tenant does not feel empowered. 
"Repeated and unreasonable inspections for cleanliness should not be allowed. Inspections should be non intrusive and only for inspection for damage, not to make sure I vacuum and clean the dust from the ceiling fans.  If the residence is in an unfit state when vacated, the landlord can remedy any damage at that stage, why are they allowed to harass tenants during their lease. "
To pay your rent in the proper time
Communication from real estate and length of time for maintenance issues 
"Cheaper rent, and more rights while living on the property. In fact there are way more than just one thing to change!"
Being able to transfer my bond to my next property. It would greatly ease the expense of moving. 
Ability to hang pictures and the like without needing to repair and repaint when there is no damage other than a picture hook
Long approval stage.  Condition of homes
"Fewer intrusive inspections, having rented for 4 years and 18 inspections thus far."
Define the term Wear and tear as this is opinion based
"Change the legislation to place a limit on the time that the agent can take to re-let the property in the event that the tenant needs to break the lease, similar to the system in other states where the tenant can only be made to cover the rent for 5 weeks after vacating. In QLD at present, if the tenant's circumstances change and they have no choice but to break the lease (e.g. job location change, etc), the leasing agent has zero incentive to re-let the property in a reasonable timeframe as there is no financial penalty for their delaying of the re-letting process. I think that the legislation/standard lease terms are too harsh towards tenants whose circumstances have unavoidably changed, but who don't necessarily qualify as experiencing hardship sufficient to enable breaking the lease without penalty. A limit on the time for re-letting would ensure that the leasing agent performs their obligations within a reasonable timeframe."
Property managers repeatedly and unfailingly exaggerating ‘damage’ or faults on exit reports and trying to fraudulently keep more of your bond. 
Longer fixed term rental
Better maintenance on houses
"Longer tenancies, less frequent inspections"
Ear marking a proportion of rent paid for maintenance and improvement of property when a tenancy has been established for two consecutive years.
Paying for water that we use I understand excess water but between 200-280 a quarter on top of rent  increases every year by 20 dollars aweek
I think once you have proved that you are a good renter then inspections should be dropped from every 3 months to 6 months. Even though I always passed with flying colours it can be very stressful 
"Do not allow people to smoke in units or on their balconies as the second hand smoke travels into other units and apart from being a health issue and disgusting, it disregards their neighbours right to not being subject to second hand smoke."
"Ensure when changes of property manager, e.g. Sale of rent roll, occur the terms of existing leases are unchanged. Both from a lease agreement perspective and from a logistics arrangement for matters such as payment method, inspection timetable etc."
Have the landlord actually get back to the realestate when maintenance has been requested. 
"The notice to renew/terminate period is not unreasonable.  However, the  ability of the tenant to defer their decision until expiration should not allow rollover to periodic!  There should be a requirement confirm or reject renewal of at least (2) weeks prior to expiry.   This is fair & allows arrangements to be made for any maintenance to be confirmed with contractor's. "
"More open communication between the landlord, property manger and tenant.   I am in a situation where I get on really well with the landlord, however, the property agent frowns on any such interaction.  This causes tension between all parties and sometimes results on issues not being fixed in a reasonable time."
More pet friendly homes and lower prices
Removing houses that have already been rented from the internet so other persons can’t look thru the home once the hous is rented by a Tennant
Cheaper rent and agents that check up more to see how things are going and have better attitudes towards tennants. 
Make sure the house has proper fly screens and a lockable screen for the front door.
"A properly certified local independent observer. To visually approve any cleaning &or repairs required by the tenant. 
Property managers do not have any recognised cleaning &or building certifications. However, their opinion is literally final and can overrule a tenant whom has utilised a certified cleaning &or trades services. Some agencies 'encourage' the use of their business contacts, or else face a difficult 'Exit' experience."
"Removing the ""notice to quit without cause"" legislation. This gives the landlord and real estates to much power over the Tennant. Good Tennants are disadvantaged by this legislation and for no reason that they may have done the Real estate or Landlord can evict.
"
"Often properties come on to the market and then are let before any inspection has taken place, including the person that the property has been let to. So either enforce the rule that properties have to have been inspected by the prospective tenant prior to their application being accepted, or change the rule. Perhaps require that at least one opportunity for in person inspection has been provided, either an open house widely advertised for at least 5 days e.g. on realestate.com.au. If changing the rule, perhaps  a walk through video and floor plan advertised for at least 5 days could be accepted as an alternative to an in person inspection. "
"More governmental control relating to the sometimes inappropriate, bullying and defamatory behaviour of some real estates. Or the regulation of more solid protection for renters relating to the ease of defamatory behaviour from real estates."
"That landlords / property managers didn't have the right to enter the property with the tenant not being present, there are way too many dishonest people in our world and they could also be, we have previously had things taken while access has been gained while we were at work."
An advocacy group for tenants. In my experience real estate agents look after their owners and not their tenants!!!!!!!
"Land lords would have to be fair, stop listing with RTA for dodgey reasons because they have an issue. Pets would be automatically allowed. "
"Longer notice of inspections / schedule of insurance 
"
The number of and frequency of inspections and tradesmens visits when there is no feedback that the property is being mistreated or uncared for.  
"Satisfied - most properties I have rented have been good, however...Dissatisfied - One property I rented with friends, the owner made promises to have certain things fixed prior to us moving in (e.g. windows were broken and not able to be opened during summer). This and other things were never fixed which caused to mould build-up in bathrooms. The owner tried to fix everything himself instead of having a tradesman complete the job, causing delays in completion time and it was not always completed correctly. We have taken the owner to QCAT etc and were awarded money as the owner refused to provide compensation in the form of a rental discount due to (what could be considered) a breach in contract leading to H&S issues (mould and blocked exits in case of fire). The owner is making it very difficult for us to ever see the money he has been ordered to pay and it is even harder as we must know his current address in order to serve him. This is practically impossible and this has now been ongoing for approximately two years. Renters need more help when it comes to situations like this when the owner has neglected to perform maintenance and upkeep on the property."
"Tenant bad behaviour, damage, non-payment of rent"
The one thing that cannot be changed: sufficient number of affordable rental options. 
The real estate having so much power over their tennants.
Being able to automatically have pets.
Better support for people with disabilities and their carers to find low cost housing with extended 5-10 year leases to provide some stability. 
Protect tenants from landlords that don't make repairs and then tell you they will blacklist you if you complain. 
"Truth in advertising - photos stretched to make rooms look bigger, or photos of the kitchen that are obviously about 10 years old."
"Bully realtors who treat renters like garbage and only care about landlords. I have had realtors tell other realtors that I am a bad tenant and bad news and have parties and all this other nonsense just so I can't leave my existing place. 
Its absolutely appalling and the system is rigged in the landlords favour. Being punished because a realtor does not want a good tenant to leave."
"Routine inspections are carried out too often, and are too strict. A person should feel comfortable and secure in their home. I understand it is somebody else’s property you are living on, but humans ‘live’ in their home and do not keep it showroom clean every single day. We shouldn’t feel attacked for having a mug on the coffee table or a pile of laundry, or a dish in the sink."
"'- More pet friendly rental properties/pet laws

- Trustworthy  real estate  that follow the rules and laws to protect renters."
I'd make the routine inspections less frequent
that all rentals be for EVERYONE including the disable elderly and the sick
"If something needs fixing or replacing needs to be done asap.
"
OWNERS OF PROPERTIES ENFORCED STOP INCREASING THE RENTS FOR LONG TERM RENTERS
All rental properties to allow cats and dogs. 
Owners accountability for communication when requesting maintenance or similar
"Customer service, I think the agents are rude and have no respect for a paying renter. 
"
"The fact that the power balance is so skewed - I can't afford to try and ensure the real estate and owners meet their legal obligations because they have so much power over me, not only through control of my current living situation and whether my lease will be renewed, but also over whether I'll be approved for my next two applications for rentals in the future through their reference being needed. "
Get paid more rent
"The current agent/landlord is fantastic however previous one was awful
No consultation and a rental increase from $485 per week to $650 in one go
Did not follow any legislation etc and I was just happy to move on to the new agent"
Difficulties experienced when tenants damage property (particularly wilful damage).
"prevent landlords from not renewing leases without reason. this one thing really biases the power in favour of the landlord, the tenant spends their tenancy paralysed in fear that they'll be evicted for requesting a repair or serving a breach notice. "
Real estates should not hold house keys.
Affordable rent: Buying property increasingly becomes out of reach for me and now I’m slugged with high rent.  We need to live in the cities to work - it’s time to consider rent control.
Set standards for rental agencies. Some of the behaviors from the larger agencies is boarding unethical.  
Less frequent inspections for long term tenants who have shown they are reliable and keep the house and property clean. All rent all properties to allow pets 
"After repairs or home developement, this should not hike the rent. Esp thing you did not wreck its just aging wear n tear of the house. We shouldnt have to pay for wear n tear damages of the house too. "
"Renters should not be discriminated for having a PET. this should be unlawful. 
Renters should be allowed to hang pictures, hang curtain rods without having to REQUEST approval.

There should be a cheaper option for Private landlords to check TICA as most can not afford it. Eg: access 2 x a year unlimited persons check or a fee for service (per tenant). Real estates dont always 'Do a better job at managing properties' make it easiers for Aussies to manage their investments a little most cost effective.

Landlord insurance.. so far I have yet to find an insurance company willing to cover my investment unit as purchase price was on $95 000 most have  starting plan for $150 000 so my unit is not insured."
having a fee free way to pay rent. Real Estates block all ways to pay rent with out a fee involved - Mine is now $5/month.
Tenants who deliberately damage properties should be penalised
"been able to talk with the owner, do six monthly inspections once you have been renting longer than a year "
Have landlords attend to property maintenance in a timely manner  
Feel less powerless - have clearer rights as a renter.
"Better information about the property. Recent photos, condition of property ect. Before wasting time going to an “Open” to view the property that was nothing like advertised "
the time frame for submitting the form when entering to the property
Property Managers need to be regulated more closely. They step far outside their roles and overstep their authority constantly and need to be stopped and watched closely in order to stop their toxic and illegal behaviour
"Being able to make the house a home.. putting pictures on the wall, having a pet , being able to make the garden nice.
Not so many inspections especially if they know you look after the property."
"Make tenants and agents liable for damage to appliances and unnecessary maintenance.  Recent experience is replacement of a refrigerator that was 'overheating' - cause activation of auto defrost.  Failure of convection/microwave oven - cause buildup of grease on microwave transmitter cover.  (Note agent had conducted tenant out and tenant in inspections a month before.
"
"Property Managers are not qualified. There is no education, compliance or regulation of the industry - they can do whatever they want. There isn't even a way to complain about them. RTA do nothing. Property Managers are in control of peoples housing and should be educated and scrutinized the way doctors and lawyers are."
Communication with the body corporate regarding property issues
The ability to apply for more than a 12 month lease would give older people like us more security.
"More consequences for sneaky lying real estate agents. 
A yes or no to pets not “pets on application” and constantly implying it’s fine then deny any pets at the last second basically tricking people into signing contracts "
Ban smoking on balconies in units as it blows into my apartment so means I cannot open my windows or use my balcony. Alternatively have entire complexes where smoking is completely banned.
Property owners need to take responsibility for ensuring that they attend to maintenance issues promptly and complete repairs in a professional manner
The industry requires greater standardisation and personal preference / prejudice needs to be limited as much as possible.
"Longer renting tenures
Having pets 
Being able to put up paintings and decors"
Get a decent agent who looks after your interest as well as the land lord
Have a pet bond in place to allow tenants have pets.
More competent real estate agents and property managers. They are hopeless at doing their jobs and the lonely problems I have had renting was from them
Feel more like it is my home
The ability to discuss with the owner about improvements at my expense eg air conditioning with a guarantee of agreed lease term
"Tenants are able to log complaints about owners not fixing fitting or fixtures on the house, without being asked to leave at the end of the lease for no reason, the owner then leases the house out to another tenant. "
"More affordable housing for singles
More housing without carpet
More properties to cater for responsible pet owners
Agents to advertise with CURRENT photographs "
The 1Form registration system used by Ray White for rental applications.  1Form is a nugatory system which delayed the submission due to inefficient processing protocols and procedures.
"Agents pick on anything when you leave, even if the property is in better condition then when you began the tenancy. They become ruthless and abusive. I have also had agents not process change of rental bond contributor forms as they say ""they don't have to"" but there is no way to tell of this. I left a tenancy early due to a DVO situation against a family member and they did nothing to try and come to a mutual agreement to end the tenancy early until I submitted a QCAT application. Which is still going ahead because now they are trying to get my housemate to pay all of the rent for a total of 8 weeks. They arranged no inspections during the time when they knew we were leaving and made the property available a week after we had already left (the end date of the notice of intention to leave). It may be small bits here and there but it's just always an extra kick in the teeth. 

My previous agents in west end were completely abusive. They would not listen to my concerns about the oven and the light - which needed to be replaced 3 times in a period of 6 months. In one inspection I told the agent about the kitchen tap becoming unscrewed and he went to his car, got a wrench and tightened it himself right in front of me. So, what has happened to the ""all repairs must be completed by a qualified person"". It's all a joke. They won't follow the rules because they know they can get away with it and there's nothing renters can do to stop them - or at least not all renters would be bothered to and just let themselves be walked over."
do not like the agent taking photo's on inspections. as it is a invasion of our privacy. 
Implement some reasonable rights for Tenants.
"Annual rent increases not being an automatic annual event.
Pets being allowed without landlords consent first"
Being able to put up curtains or pictures in a tidy and precise manner to make things more homely without fear of losing bond. 
Have guaranteed long-term tenancy rights.
Having solar panels to reduce the electricity bill and a water tank to make the home eco-living and sustainable. 
Term  of lease should be monthly not weekly
Renting prices and availability and accept pets
Being able to get the landlord to do repairs. 
"Tenants often damage houses and move on with little being able to be done about other than losing their bond.
People who do not own their own house often destroy the carpets and insides by letting animals live in the house, making it almost untenable to rent."
Reduce red tape on landlords.  Costs are increasing and rental returns reducing - so I will be considering that its no longer wirthwhile keeping a roof over someones head
Landlords should be required legally to fix property issues instead of just passing them off and giving tenants the option to break the lease. There should be a minimum amount that agents are able to spend on the owners behalf to get things fixed quickly. 
Integrity of Property Managers
Cheaper rent and not paying for water 
Past repairs and maintenance made available to create awareness of problems to avoid trapping new tenants.
More stringent requirements for property managers in responding to renter enquiries and issues. 
Easier to make appointments to view properties. Logging on line can be difficult and can't always get a suitable time.
constantly alerting to maintenance requirements but never hear anything till weeks later if at all. Been told to chase it up myself
"The right to own pets, the right to not be discriminated against because of children and the right to change wall colours and hang photos.

Basic rights for a person to make a house a home."
Renters have more support and rights when things go wrong. 
A higher standard of rental properties. 
Have a larger Solar system installed to allow me to run the large air conditioner which is installed at the rental property. Costs to much to run.
Have owners be more understanding of tenants needs
No rent increase every year...easier to allow pets 
"Being allowed to have pets, and to make small changes around the home i.e. putting up hooks for pictures etc"
More houses that allow pets
Smoking rules; tenants should not be allowed to smoke outside other tenants' properties.
Being able to inspect the property for more than 10 minutes before a commitment is made.
Give property managers less power to dictate to tenants unreasonably.
Time frame for repairs and maintenance needed
Better control and measures and means of recuperating monies over tenants who do not do the right thing such as absconding without paying their rent. Debt collectors seem to be ineffective and do not live up to their claims. A tighter control encompassing current contact details of tenants would be a start. How often do we hear that the 'former tenant' could not be contacted!!!
More freedom to make the house homey. Hang pictures for example. 
faster return/transfer of bond when changing residence
"More clarity, I had an experience some time back where I had an agreement with the agent that the house would be repainted prior to moving in, the deposit was paid and then when I went to inspect the paint job it was only patches and a different colour to the walls.  I informed that I would not proceed if it was not rectified and they claimed that I had a lease agreement with them as I had paid the deposit, but I had not signed anything (that was due on the day of taking possession) so therefore I was not privy to the conditions within it.  They then proceeded to charge me rent on the property until they found a new tenant, still without a signed agreement using the pretence of ""intention to lease due to deposit"", if the full contract was supplied at the time of the agent accepting the application then this issue would not have arisen.  "
Better information on ppls rights when realty isnt following the rules 
Better communication between the Landlord and real estate 
Clearer rules & rights for both tenants and owners. Tenants aren't able to treat the house as their home; but owners aren't able to protect their property from bad tenants
"I would like to see the rents cheaper, as they take a lot from your income, also I would like to see Landlords more open to allowing pets eg small dog - The rents are crazy for Pensioners"
a one shop area to apply for rentals and have overall control of rentals. in the houses we have rented the land agents have changed at least 3 times. Also at least knowledge of who we are renting from.
"Some rules in place regarding wall hangings such as paintings, etc."
Never use real estate agents
The over the top renting prices
"Major safety hazards are fixed.  I am waiting for a balustrade to be reinstalled to the deck since moving in August 2018.  The owner promised to install the balustrade the following week I moved in.  Also, that the owner stays away from the property.  I have had approximately 6 entry notices for the owner to coat the deck.  The owner was painting the back stair tread after I took over the premises.  He had the whole house open when I tried to move in on the first day and an old electrical hot water system across the driveway.  I could not unload my car or move into the property."
Security of tenure - longer leases
"More affordable housing, esp for single people.  One bedroom places are unfairly priced for a single person."
Allowing pets at all homes
"Tighter deadlines for owners to provide both emergency and general maintenance - they should discouraged from ""shopping around"" for the best quote for a service. This is disruptive, time consuming, and costly for the tenant, especially if one has to take time off from work. If the owner chooses the cheapest option for a product (e.g.,. fly screen covers rather than security screens for low hanging windows), the tenant should be asked if they would like to pay the difference for the more secure / useable option."
"More accountability to ensure all house fixture and applicants not only work, but work efficiently. Accountability on owners/real estates not renewing leases after repair requests are made."
crazy female homeowners who withhold bond money because THEY claim damage which doesn't exist
"the price of properties and the state there in for the price. how long maintenance takes or isn't done at all. the percentage of rent how its calculated.no picture hooks and how tenant has very little right without fallout of there next property they may need.
"
"Increase the rights of tenants to longer contracts (ideally follow a model that allows for lifelong rentals).

Allow greater privacy to tenants by reducing inspections to yearly 

Allow equity of access to renting by preventing the practice of being bid out for a residence

Allow equity of access by reducing the power of landlords/property management to increase rent

"
"If you’ve never given the real estate or landlord reason to doubt you, settle down with the home inspections. It’s invasive and unnecessary if you’ve never caused a problem. "
"Accountability. Agents are free to lie cheat and steal with impunity, and it is the tenant stuck with the bill."
"Currently the real estate conducts a house inspection every 3 months. There should be a system where once the tenant proves they are caring for the home sufficiently, the house inspection should be conducted either 6 monthly or annually only."
"Real Estates need better communication skills, and needs to stop being so hard for young people to rent. I cannot get a house anywhere in my local town at all. Got no idea why. I have a family to support and how can I do that without anywhere to live? "
Not having an inspection from the real estate every 3 (THREE) months.
"Better transparency with rental agreements, and what tenants use they pay for. Some services such as garbage collection and council as ons should be paid for by the tenant."
"Timely and regular maintenance on the property is needed.
Timely and accurate utilities plus the right to change providers."
I feel tenants are very much behind the 8 ball so to speak when it comes to pets. I already have signed an agreement explaining I am obliged to pay for any damages why not allow my dog to be inside if I do so. Most rentals will only accept outdoor dogs and in QLD with the storms and heat it truly makes it difficult to have a pet.
"As landlords, we have lost many rights in the house that we financially own.  The situation goes both ways.  Respect is earned - not given."
The landlord/agents or lack of clarity as to who was making the decisions.  The agent blames the landlord but i'm just not sure it is actually them...
Owners allowing pets. And against shared driveway. 
Less routine inspections; I don’t appreciate having my home traipsed through every 3 months. 
Be able to personalise the place more - hooks and nails etc 
More homes being pet friendly 
Property Manager attitudes to Landlord first approach
Either decrease rent prices or have rental agencies monitored and held accountable.
Being able to talk to the tenants directly without having to go through an agent. 
Shorter term contracts. 12 mth lease is too long when your new to an area
"Owners having to fix things when asked, and not having to write endless rta reports to get things fixed."
I feel that as a landlord the law (even QCAT) favours the tenant. The scales are not even.
The “same condition” rule seems to suit only the owners and not take general wear and tear into account 
The representation from the property manager to protect the tenant as fairly as they do the landlord.
Allow me to treat it like my home. I want a pet and want to be able to hang photo of family on my wall. Stop the real estate from taking photos of my whole house/home everytime they come to inspect. I have rented the house for 7+years.
"The house has no fly screen or any screen in most of the windows.  The only.put in 3 screen the house, have no idea why anyone would do that.  Lease ran out for 6 months before they sent me a new lease, nothing was ever fixed."
"Inspections every 3 months is over kill.  I think this should be determined on a case by case basis.  I also believe that general wear and tear should not be expected to be fixed by tenants.  If the floor tiles are quite old and chipping here and there naturally because of age, it is not up to the tenant to replace floor tile.  If there is an obvious issue where it is obvious there has been a ""gash"" or something then that is different.  Also with curtains.  They are never freshly cleaned when you move into a property however the real estate always insist that you clean them when you leave, even if they are in the same condition as when you moved in.  This is robbery."
some sort of protection against real estates who don't look after your property well. Ie not calculating rent in arrears correctly/ not organising repairs in accordance with our direction etc.
Inspections should be limited to every 6 months...
The energy provider needs competition and the rates in Innisfail qld 4860 are to high which in turn drives up the rent price 
Being able to hang photos 
I think an undesirable Landlord List or a Landlord 5 star rating system would be helpful
"More affordability when it comes single renters like myself. More flexibility when it comes to living arrangements aka pets, hanging hooks/nails etc"
Cheaper rent. Access to property management reviews. 
Being able to secure draws/cupboards to walls in childrens rooms
Give more power to tenants in regards to the upkeep of maintenance on a rental property. The tenants have no rights if the landlord won't fix anything. 
"Quicker response regarding high risk maintenance issues. 
More allowances regarding pets. "
More diverse lease options. Like as short as 4 months but as long as 18months as well. More 18month leases needed for security! And without rent going up. Rent should NOT go up during a lease !! 
"Pets should be allowed
Reasonable times between inspections
Not be blamed for previous tenants damage"
"a better complaints system required for real estate agents and to ensure real estates are aware of legislation
"
When things go wrong that the landlord realised that things happen and not take so long to approve fixing things.
Easier / more accessible / more responsive / more accommodating process with the tribunal
"More affordable rentals especially in the NRAS, these rentals are so far out of reach of single, low income people."
Never move in with someone from flat mates.com again.
"That I wasn't responsible for all the yard and garden maintenance.
"
"That rental property owners cannot list a property for sale after renting the property to a tenant, unless agreed with the tenant. "
Unfair withholding of the bond
"Quicker maintenance response time. 
We tried to have a glass door replaced on the tenant's house insurance, but were told we had to repair it ourselves.  We don't argue with our agency as we don't want to have any fears about our tenancy continuing."
Property Managers/Agencies have a lot of room for improvement
My landlord to be reasonable about fixing things in the house
Better contact between renter and landlord via agent.
Greater ability for tenants to request/influence change or improvements to the property
Owners who get you to resign a lease then put the property on the market and won’t allow you to break the lease 
"Agents' requirements to disclose certain things about a premises, eg community facilities in the neighbourhood, problems with the premises.  I have rented place and later found out that there was an alcohol rehabilitation centre next door which caused a lot of trouble for me, and malfunctioning garage doors with agents not prepared to do anything about it.  Also not being able to contact the landlord directly if the agent is not relaying information to the owner to protect their own interests.  "
The real estate agents I've dealt with are all very very rude......I've never ever experienced this in any other country I've ever lived and worked. And I always pay my rent on time and keep my houses/units in pristine condition.
"Lower rent!
Longer leases so your have more security, not moving every 6 to 12 months!
More rent to buy deals so you can get off the rental round about!"
"Being allowed to have a pet, hang up a photo , in a rental I was previously in I wasn’t allowed to change the curtains to make it more homey and have the opportunity to have a pet "
more pressure on real estate to abide by the laws they are meant to. And harsher punishment for not following the laws. 
"Nothing, I’m quiet happy renting and speaking to the real estate about issues. "
"Being able to attach pictures to the wall, even if it means repairing and painting over any holes before ending the lease."
I would love to be able to make an application to have a small dog where I live. That would be the only reason we would need to leave where we currently are. 
The way the cost of rentals and all associated costs are grossly inflated and in some cases outrageous.
Balance tenant and rental property owner interests
"When an owner decides not to renew your lease you should be able to leave before the lease end date without any penalties. For example, you have found another place to lease but need to occupy the new premises immediately then you should not be made to pay for rent on both properties. Trying to find a new property to lease is hard enough, trying to start a new lease exactly at the time of leaving the old property is next to impossible. "
"Give tentants a competing rate of interest on their bond money. 
Give tentants the right to break lease without shame or bad record 
life changes we should not be penalized because of this . 


"
"Finding the best, reliable, suitable Tenants"
Real estate staff speaking and treating me with respect and not have a 'power over' attitude. 
"Inspections every 6 months are offensive when you are a good, long term tenant.
Repairs take too long to be completed and we need to work around multiple access times for quotes and then repairs.
No improvements or general wear and tear maintenance in 5 years."
"When houses being rented are put on the market for sale, rent should be reduced to compensate for the intrusion and inconvenience of regular inspections on the tenants "
"Less checks on property, and real estates held accountable "
"If the property you are renting goes up for sale, there should be a clause that lets you break the lease early. It is an invasion of privacy have people traipse through your space."
"Once we find places, we haven't had issues with managers BUT the competitive viewing of properties is grueling, time consuming, and inefficient. I will always gravitate to properties that have on-site management or at least easy-to-access managers that will show me their property at an agreed upon time rather than showing up when 20 others are there shown by uncaring real estate agents."
"Stop real estate agents from their greediness, rent is way too high without them taking their bit out and not even doing routine inspections or attending to any repairs. Also shouldn’t have to pay for water, isn’t that what we pay rent for? "
"Some owners don’t want to fix defects ie smelly carpet eg animal urine
Owners at times want to find petty excuses to claim fixes from bond money when leaving property. 
Tenants sometimes restricted on the use of the property eg owner will leave personal items in storage shed

"
"The attitude held by many real estate agents that renters are lazy, untrustworthy scum who will destroy property or fail to pay rent on time if not spoken too aggressively and threateningly on a regular basis. Unreasonable demands and judgments surrounding rental property inspections - it is unfair, intrusive and unnecessary to pass judgment on tenets choice of furnishings or possessions (such as owning musical instruments) so long as the property is not being damaged."
"Real estates not siding with owners. If owners can not afford to repair a prooerty they should not be allowed to rent it, if the property can't be repaired real estates and owners should have to pay to relocate the tenant not just allow them out of a lease."
Tired of moving because the owners suddenly want to sell
Inspections being carried out when no one is home.
More legal protections and legal rights for landlords.
"Tenants should be paying for water, as is the case in other states."
That each rental via real estate agents should use a mandatory repair checklist rather than the current model where the tenant has to lodge a complaint to have items fixed. 
able to do things that need doing without constant communication through land agent then the land lord
Some of the property managers I have had have been very hard to contact and another one very unreasonable.  One in particular put me on the black list for renting even though she had been notified that I had been declared bankrupt.  Three years later I found out I was on it and she refused to take me off the list till I had paid what I originally owed eve though she was not permitted to chase me for the money
"As a Landlord, I am happy with the status quo and would not change anything"
"As a landlord, I would like to see that I have more control in ending the tenant agreement when they default or breach the terms of the tenancy agreement. The agreement is weighted heavily in favour of the tenant and as owners we are powerless to gain control of our property/payments due. The process is arduous."
Better bind dispute resolution service
Making the real estates more accountable for property management. Having standards and proper documentation (photos) of inspections. 
"The application process is extremely stressful. Not knowing if you will be approved for a place that you are happy to make your home, having to wait to hear back, being rejected because who knows how many other people have applied for the property. "
Penaltys for owners that refuse to repair items.  Currently the only option is to move out.  This costs the tenant.
"more right for tenants
fair trading from real estate agencies"
Ensuring maintenance is up to standard
Lengthen rental agreements
Three monthly inspections can feel intrusive . Being allowed to let my small dog stay inside the house as long as i keep the house clean and repair any damage caused.
"Allowing small pets, I find majority of rentals are have a straight no pets policy without giving consideration to the type of pet and nature."
Simpler process to follow for renters
"Obtain cheaper suitable rental as being on the aged pension, private rental is a big chunk of our payment."
the rental rates being more equal across similar types of housing.
"Lengthy waiting times for urgent repairs- quotes and going back and forth with Agents, Owners and Repairers"
"Compensation available for abusive management, filthy common areas, invasion of privacy and defamatory gossip by landlord's representative instead of landlord taking advantage of current system to abuse renters"
"Allow pets in all dwellings and to include any pet as a pet rather than a small cat or dog. Some are denied having birds, fish and hermit crabs because of the no pet policy that most landlords and real estate agents staff try to enforce. It is not healthy to live alone so a pet gives a person living alone a positive reason to live. A pet becomes part of the family and children are distressed when renters have to give their family member away to an animal refuge place. This also puts strain on other areas in the community. Having a broader mind or mindset would improve the tenant relationship."
Pets approved on all properties with references and registration where applicable.
Dodgy or unethical owners should be placed on a register.
"It’s so hard to get to view houses whilst working, to have a bond plus two weeks rent PLUS the costs of moving."
deal with owners rather than real estate agents
All properties should allow pets
More scrutiny on owners who manage their own properties. 
Being denied because of pets or being young. 
Longer time frames between routine Inspections
Allow tenants to have pets especially good tenants 
"I'd like to have more stability - I hate knowing that the owner has the power to order me out with only 60 days notice!
I'd also like more guidance around mould and where responsibilities lie for each party.  In Queensland this is a big issue!"
"Less inspections when you have been a resident for a long period of time.
Flexible times for inspections when you have work commitments"
"Reformed the education and training of the property managers we had to deal with. Property managers can behave poorly and there recourse for their behaviour. there is no system set up to make a complaint about them, and there is no way of letting the property owner know they are not favourably upholding the property owners interests."
longer leases. the longestest lease you can get is 1 year which generates uncertainly and anguish with tennants. 5 and 10 years lease option would be good
"Rent increases above and beyond cpi without any improvements. First rental we had in QLD started at $280 per week. Upon renewal 6 months later, $310, then, $340, and if we wanted to stay again and renew, $380 per week, an increase of more than 20% each year. Rediculous as we always paid rent in advance, never asked for anything other than minimal repairs and they were DAMN slow at getting anything done, and we looked after the place very well. Where we are now, it is about 5 to 6% increase each year, well above CPI still, and as the market is falling but at least not 20+%. "
That owners would look at my impeccable rent record and not my long-term  unemployment.
There should be a cooling off period of 6 weeks wereby issues with the property arise which could not be reasonably identified when inspecting the property.  e.g. Noise from resedences above in a unit where people can be heard walking about transmiting thuding sounds in the ceiling below.
Make it illegal to refuse an application due to pet ownership. Would be happy to pay increased bond for owner peace of mind to get a property I like in a suitable area.
Greater requirements for housing to be properly cleaned by owners prior to entry equal to the requirement of a tenant vacating a property.
I'd change property managers to become decent human beings.
six monthly home inspections instead of 3 monthly....
"Good tenants deserve good landlords. Too many take your rent but wont repair and maintain the property.  Agents are worse.
But tenants cant do anything about it. 
Accountability! "
"My realestate agent took money from my bond without even contacting me. We paid $490 for a bond clean (which the agent called the company to confirm) but the agent went ahead and charged $200 for their own cleaners to come in. Under legislation they are required to keep our cost as low as possible, but didn't bother to call our bond cleaner for them to come back in. We were also charged for the removal of furniture that belonged to the owner. We took the matter to the RTA, but the money had to come from myself or the owner when it was really the responsibility of the realestate agent. Other tenants renting from the same agency have made complaints about being charged $200 extra for cleaning when they themselves hired bond cleaners. How do we know that these ""cleaners"" came and are not just associates of the realestate agents. I have rented for 17 years in Australia, across WA, SA, NSW and QLD, this was the first time I had money ever taken from my bond. The realestate agent needs to be accountable in the same way the owner or tenants are."
The cost of renting is astronomical in Brisbane. I am a working single parent. The cost of renting takes half my income. My situation is not desperate enough to realistically actually receive Dept of Housing housing. I reapplied every year for three years but was told basically my situation was not extreme enough and that I was unlikely to be housed. I am the 'working poor' - living from fortnight to fortnight but never able to get ahead financially because such a huge chunk of my income goes in rent.
"Allow Bodies Corporate flexibility in setting rules to apply in respect of short term rentals, eg. AirBnB"
The property manager needs to communicate better. To the tenants AND amongst themselves! Also would prefer if the people we had to deal with were qualified real estate agents?! 
Make sure landlords fix things quickly and without increasing rent to do so 
The standard of service and respect for remnants by agents and owners.
The exit conditions. Real estates expect far too much and set the standards unrealistically. And it costs far too much. 
Greater powers to qualiying landlords who abide by the tenancy act . 
"Having a choice in the timing/day people enter the property for inspections, etc.  "
managing maintenance of properties and improvement on how to manage arrears more effectively
"Better 3 way relationships between tenant, agent and landlord"
Having contractors respect the tenant more.
More Acreage availability and at reasonable affordable prices 
"There is no transparency. For example our rent goes up and down with no reasonable explanation or consultation. Water bills come in adhoc. We have been renting our apartment for 4 years and our contact at the agency seems to change every few months. There is no consistency in their approach to us and no acknowledgement  given to the fact that we are good tenants who pay rent on time every week, cause no damage and only report real issues when they come up. "
Less house inspections and more in house freedom 
Property managers doing there job
Rent consistently going up each year regardless.   Be nice to be able to have a 2-3 year lease with the set rent for that period when you are a long term renter
The property managers are slack and unhelpful.
Ability to report poor real estate practice
Have the owner pay for water as they do in the NT
photos during routine inspections are an unnecessary invasion of a tenants privacy. If something is broken and needs repairs then photos are fair enough. A tenant has no control over the photos of their belongings  been shown to 3rd party’s. In a world of cybersecurity thief the storage of these photos is also a great security concern for me. If a thief got a hold of these they would know what addresses to target for expensive possessions to steal. The photo’s also show living arrangements that are private in nature eg if my wife and I sleep in different beds. 
I think real estate agents need more support to enforce rules on the landlords where needed. When I have needed something urgently repaired the landlord has taken weeks to approve.
Would love if all houses had solar panels. With the soaring prices of electricity sometimes makes it hard to pay other bills. Without the high cost rent would never be missed.
More ability to to make owners and rental agencies actually be honest and helpful without having to threaten to or actually go to the RTA.
"Make it easier to have pets in rental properties, including units, apartments and townhouses"
Revision of legislation to limit agents abilities to unfairly (and rudely) attempt to charge exiting tenants for phantom repairs and maintenance. Respect for great tenants - not treat them as inferior. 
"Compulsory Professional Development courses for employees of real estates in property rental divisions.
We have had 3 property management agents in 4 years and I’m disappointed in all of them. My last rental property 7 years- same mature managing agent and not 1 issue. The communication skills the young women/men have that are employed by real estates in the property rental departments is apalling. They seem to think they hold a position of entitlement. Most of them are initially employed as a receptionist ‘Gatekeeper’ due to age, and moved onto the rental division as their staff burn out as they have not been equipped with appropriate training in Negotiation, Diplomacy and Communication. 
I have no issue with the Laws for renting in Qld, I have an issue with real estates that try and rewrite the laws eg: issuing all tenants water bills with 2 weeks to pay instead of the stated ‘one month from invoice date’.  It wasn’t a huge issue till they ignored two phone calls and then on third one the young ‘Gatekeeper’ told me with attitude ‘it was the way their office did things’. Needless to say I took her to task and cited the section in the act and was hung up on. Surely there is a governing body that audits real estate rental divisions. Why is it that tenants are seen as troublemakers when it’s the real estates themselves can’t follow laws? Even after being told after each inspection the property is beautifully presented, they hike my rent up double of what they put it up last year.......Because I dared to challenge them. "
Having the option of a 6 month lease available. Reduced bond requirements - it's a lot of money to outlay initially. Standardised rent i.e. my next door neighbour pays $100 less per week for basically the same townhouse.
Change the requirement on property owners rights to sell to include minimum 2 months notice to tennants and not before an existing lease end date.  Reason - The lease agreement for a fixed term should be just that and the landlord should ensure that they have suitable protection to ensure that they can provide that.  Plus 30 days notice under a periodic lease is nigh on impossible to achieve without significant compromise placing tennants in untenable situations.
"I would like to be able to make adjustments, like being able to paint the walls and hang photos up."
more affordable housing for families. longer leases.
"Recognition of the landlords right to preserve their asset, with faster ability to remove tenants who are either damaging a property or in rent default. Currently it can take months, leaving the landlord with thousands to pay in repairs or rent arrears."
"Faster turn around on maintenance especially concering security issues and water leaks.  Neither jobs were actually completed - just a fast non complete job that hasn't fixed our issues. 

Not meeting us half way with us offering to do the labour if they supply weed mat for under all of the wood chips.

In the past we have always lost some bond even when the house was better than what it was when we moved in and then they demolish it anyway without actually doing the so called bond cleans (twice this has happened)."
12 monthly Professional cleaning of air conditioning units by the owner- I have lived here for 12 months and both times have gone into a new property with air conditioning units thick with black mould and not working at full capacity.  As I've had to pay both times to have the units professionally cleaned as the owners refused .  This is a health issue and needs to be addressed.
Longer lease options
"The one thing I would like to improve how a tenant is treated regarding repairs in the house you are renting. I have trouble with my real estate regarding getting things repaired e.g. the ceiling fan in the main bedroom stopped working on 17/11/18, I used the maintenance manager app that the real estate supplied to put in all our repairs and still haven't heard anything about this issue. I have had other issues regarding repairs that aren't done, or won't be completed at this time as the owner isn't interested in fixing the problem. Took me nearly a year to have the tank base repaired as the boards were all rotting. My granddaughter fell in between the boards as the gravel underneath was washed away. I could go on put you understand that it is not easy dealing with real estates who then say it's the owners not us. I have been in this property for 8 1/2 years."
Less house inspections. With 4 kids one every 3 months is a pain on my schedule 
More complete rental reports detailing maintenance issues that need to be addressed. This would enable the ability to fix and maintain the property to keep it in the best shape over time.
"Most real estate agents have zero care factor, and do not communicate adequately, and treat renters poorly"
"Respect. That people who rent have the same rights to be treated respectfully. This goes hand in hand in the amount of rent landlords charge tenants, the quality and maintenance of the living conditions for the tenants, and the way real estates and owners treat tenants."
Bonds are low and do not cover loss of rent and damage.
Longer lease agreements
making sure tenants understand legislation
"real estate agents sometimes do not listen to our requests that are essential to get fixed or, at least should be taken into consideration. Neighbours do not comply with general tenancy rules, such as smoking and noise rules.   "
In 2 years we had to move 4 times because the owner decides to sell....if they are thinking of selling...DON'T RENT YOUR PROPERTY!
The way routine inspections are conducted.
"More support from a real estate when needing vacate a property due to some form of hardship.
To be allowed to hang pictures on the walls provided renter fixes any damage
Pets allowed in all properties "
Honest communication with REA regards to maintenance and improvements
Lower rental prices
Too much red tape when looking and the real estate agents ate usually inflexible with inspection dais and times
Property managers to have more authority in ensuring their owner's property's are looked after
Affordability and long term rental contracts to give a sense of stability and security with minimal increases in rent.
Would be good if it took less than several weeks for a cooker/oven to be replaced 
Being allowed to have pets without any issue
"Take it out of the hands of real estate agents .. the change in the process to rent a property through RE Agents is horrendous from start to finish .. the advertising, viewing and application process used to be so easy .. not any more ..  There should be rent control and the 3 month inspections are an invasion .."
Something in place to prevent real estate agents and owners from trying to steal our bond money when we move out
More clarity around Body Corporate laws and how to access a copy. 
"Change the way rent is paid.  Not through ""payment"" agencies that like to charge processing fees.  In many cases, the tenant is forced over a barrel in which this is the only option."
"Like most people I can understand living in a block of units is ill advisable to have four legged pets. But why are we no longer allowed a bird? An inside bird, that makes no external noise that neighbours can hear.
Also why are landlords allowed to NOT carry out repairs for an age. Up to a year in one case."
"* Owners decreasing the time it takes to attend to repairs.
* More feedback from Property Manager as to how long repairs will take. "
"The rental agencies. They do not add value to renting. No proper service before or during renting but they are always there to make sure they nail renters on exit by claiming above and beyond ‘reasonable wear and tear’. They are also slow to respond or help when issues occur and help is needed and usually just send a link to some or othet online system to submit tickets. However, once submitted it is not actioned unless the tenant follows up continuously. The agencies also do not give reasonable notice of a visit. "
Landlords and real estate agents being fairer to single families 
The time it takes for repairs with agents and owners
Owners to inspect the premises before bond is returned to tenants.
Repairs/Maintenance to Property and Place Of Residence for renters on a better time frame
When something needs to be fixed on/in your property gets done within a 10 day turnaround time eg: air conditioner.
"Implement laws like in Victoria which give greater freedoms to renters to have pets at a rental property. The number of homeless pets in this state is astounding, rescue shelters are overwhelmed, and RSPCA euthenaises a very high number of dogs & cats who have been surrendered to them. Over the last few years it has been very noticeable in Brisbane, the increase of standard ""no pets"" clauses on rental properties. At this rate the only homes where pets can live will be owner-occupied housing, rather ridiculous."
The quarterly inspections are disruptive as I need to be on premises since have work papers here. Find these regular taking of photos intrusive. 
"In some areas property owners and rental agents believe that if the district has large commercial activities such as mines/power stations, etc. they can up the rental rates. For those that do not work in these industries but who need to Rent in these areas, places undue stress and quite often hardship on more meagre household incomes."
"Quicker response time from agent for
1.  Decision on application 
2. Getting repairs done.
4. Applications shouldn't be based on which applicants earns the most money.
"
Some real estate agents attitude. Seems to be an automatic negative opinion of someone who is renting. Not all just some.
"Better property managers, they need training and life experience."
"From a Property Owner’s perspective, I would say Tenant’s accountability for the damage that they cause in the property and not continuing with the upkeep and maintenance of the yard."
"Landlords need to do as asked when issues arise. When renting and signing a lease and is in place that when you lease is in place landlords want their property back and give you limited time to find suitable places and when you don't find something your forced to take any house because they want it, I think when this happens they can pay some type of compansation"
"Artificially high long term rental costs.
Renting should be for those first beginning their lives together with a chance to save for a future permanent home - not a trap to keep people poor for the rest of their lives."
Transfer of bonds when moving to a premises with a different Agent.
Estate agents maintaining the property 
Tenants to have realistic expectations from landlords regarding requests.  Landlords don’t have endless money. 
"The tenant's responsibility to notify the owner / agent of damage immediately so as to prevent further damage, such as water leak, to enable the owner to make a repair while the costs are still relatively small,  rather than waiting after significant damage has occurred.  "
lease termination fees (early exit) and the end of lease house standard. not everyone can afford the get the house professionally cleaned and when they do it is still not good enough for the leasing agents and you still never get your bond back.
"Inspections for properties to rent made available in times suitable for people who work.
When changing from one property to another options to be made available so the bond could be transferred from one property to another - there currently is a gap of about 2 wks where they require the bond upfront before you receive it back from the property you move out of."
"Greater clarification and rules about claims made by agents when a tenant breaks the agreement early eg. must advertise ASAP, cannot increase the rent, relet fee based on prorata amount "
Have more power to evict tenants who continue to pay late.
"I've been renting for the past 3 years with my partner and we have noticed that once we sign the lease, the agents generally tend to not responding to our questions, and when there's problems with the property, they only care about the owner's benefits. It will make us feel more confident when renting if we can be assured that the agents/owners will take the responsibilities to resolve the issues when they occur."
"More affordable house, town house or unit to rent at a lower price, maybe around $150/week due to the cost of living expenses."
Allow pets and have real estates/owners responsible for the state of a house on entry!
Notice periods and stigma around renting.
"Ensuring that real estates get back to you quicker if you’re unsuccessful for a property application and that landlords don’t put up the rent every time you sign a renewal. 
"
Cost and real estate communication
More time to move EG: 2 months notice is not enough as most real estates advertise for new tenants 1 month ahead it takes a week to move including overlap to clean etc so you have at most only 3 weeks to find a new place which is nowhere near enough time especially as you are competing with so many others during this time and maynot get one of the very few available during that 3 weeks.. .If you leave early you have to pay double rent and you can't leave late !!!
"More flexible leases. Eg not just ""12 month"" option. To be able to have more flexible options (eg month to month) as an option. We feel like we can't ask for options, because if we do, our rent may be increased or a lease renewal knocked back."
Rental inspections feel more like house cleaning inspections!
Greater clarity as to prospective tenants. 
Not having to provide everything a tenant requests
"The length and terms of the lease 
Long term say 30-50yrs starts high like mortgage but reduces overtime and tenant pays a larger bond (like deposit) tenant is responsible for fixing any and all utilities and behaves like leasee so can paint and renovate hme inspection not necessary as if the hse gets trashed they still have to pay out the lease and don’t get the bond/ deposit back.
"
Fairness for tenants during inspection. The house can look lived in and well maintIned without scrutiny.
No 3 monthly inspections it feels to often and an invasion of privacy 
Communication skills and time processes
I don’t like my property being photographed on inspection of property 
More transparency and regulate the leasing agents
"There should be a health and safety standed set in place for each rental property.  Also with the growing population and fewer homes to rent a lengthier time should be given if the owner, rental angent does not want to offer a new lease. "
Agencies/Landlords to carry out maintenance in a timely manner and for Owners not to have their own additional inspections on top of the agency's inspection.
I have been renting same property for 5 years and never had a housing inspection defect.  Why must I still have these imposed every 3 months
"when maintenance is requested and required, that it promptley be completed. 
that the water bills be issued on time at each quarter, as every house I have rented in queensland the realestates have held onto the water bills until the end of our lease and then they have taken our bond to pay for them, just  because they couldnt be bothered to do there job in accordance witht he lease agreement which states we are to recieve water usage bills every quater and be provided 30 days to pay for them. this has never occurred and again is now occurring in my current rental, when contacting the RTA they are no help they have just advised that we keep calling the realestate and then they approve the sign over of the bond to pay for it even though the water bills havnt been issued to us until the end so when you are talking about a years worth of water bills its alot of money and it makes it even harder to cover a new bond for a new place."
"More leniency to young couples with good rental history, pets, and more opportunity to maintain the property. "
There's nothing I can change. Renting sux
"tougher consequences for tenants who misbehave in rental properties, leaving a property unclean and in disrepair with the owners and property managers left to deal with the costs and efforts to restore the property to it's former condition."
The ability to have pets and personalise the house/apartment within reason
"Bond refunds. Realestate agents have the power to keep the bond money, no questions asked. The tenacy board is geared to help the Realestate Agents and not the renters."
"Renting would be much easier if there was a body that could reprimand real estate agents/landlords/property managers for breaking RTA rules and regulations. I have witnessed multiple property managers conducting business in such a way that is against RTA rules and nothing was ever done about it aside from the RTA telling me that I should ""notify them of their misconduct""."
Rental prices are insanely high and there’s not enough places to rent
When first moved in the rental property was poorly kept (DIRTY) and management very rude. Poorly regulated. 
Realestate agencies.. not all but some not informing landlords of concerns until months have passed and more damage is done to property costing the landlord thousands of dollars.  Communication for some realestates need huge improvements
"Private lessors must have mandatory education in the Qld Rental Tenancy Act and it's applications prior to managing their properties. 
"
"I would like to live like it is my own place. 
At the moment, it is like I am a servant and looking after my master's house even though I need to pay rent. "
"Some tenants are very good , but some tenants have cost me thousands in repairs, new locks, etc."
All apartments and houses should have crim safe screens or some kind of security screen on the doors and windows. Especially if on ground level 
Less frequent and intrusive inspections
"Where a lease is broken due to illness or death of a partner, the restrictions and outrageous costs should be changed to allow for a smooth transition for a family who is already suffering enormously due to illness, disability or grief. 

My bill for breaking a lease due to the death of my partner and a very sudden and severely disabling back problem 4 days later, ended up being several thousand dollars, and that was after the landlord very generously removed some of the fees.

I found it outrageous that I was still being charged full rent on the property many weeks after moving out, because the real estate agent took several weeks to even start the process of re-leasing the property, ie she didn't care and there were no penalties for her complete inaction."
"Removing Unfair fee
Foraging agents to reply to emails"
Landlord doing more to keep the property in great conotion.  Some things are getting old and require replacing.
"More security with longer term leasing 
Rental costs have increased exponentially 
Landlords tend to put up the rent every time you need to renew the lease.
Even the worst rental accomodation is really expensive in the inner city 
You have to really know your rights to be treated even remotely fair 
There is no leniency for ware and tear at the end of the lease even if you have lived there a long time and it was crappy to begin with "
Being able to call owner with problem so it doesnt take 6 months to fix a problem or ask a question.
More rights for owners to be compensated for damage and rent default
Agencies and landlords need to be held to a standard - a maximum time period of 2 weeks for concerns and maintenance to be addressed.
Less apathy from the property managers.
"The entry and exit forms, you should be able to submit online."
"Clearer respect, rights and responsibilities for tenants. Better rules around the behaviour of real estate agents towards tenants. Clarity on what constitutes normal ""wear and tear"" when vacating a property. "
"Agents insisting on you leaving a premises in better condition than you found it.
"
"make payments without extra processing charges, It is part of the cost of property company doing business , and should be factored in their cost analysis."
"Always make sure you are on a lease 
Private landlords are not all good "
"I have been an owner/landlord for almost 30 years. I have had numerous bad tenants, and had to resort to the legal process to have the tenants evicted twice. It takes so long to get to court. Everything is geared towards the tenants. At present I am in the process of repairing a house trashed by tenants. One change - make the process to deal with a bad tenant easier. Emotionally I cant take it any more and selling all my rental properties. "
"I currently have a 12 month lease, therefore as per other States, why ccan't I have one only Annual House Inspection & should d bee able to be in attendance at every inspection."
Allowing pets in all properties 
Stronger plenaltys applying to real estates and land lords who do not fix things that are requested to be fixed. If houses are not up to standard real estates should not get away with renting them and then making excuses when land lord can’t afford to fix things that are necessity’s.
"Landlords more rapidly responsive to maintenance requests
Easier to have pets in rental property
Stop annual rental price increases"
"The whole application and justifying your existence process, especially when you have never rented before but have been a home owner"
Relax on having pets in a property. 
More transparency and consistency with power and water bills. 
"Better response time from real estate agents and better response time in resolving issues, even if they are simple. Eg. My toilet seat hasn’t been there for 6 months. "
Ultimate decisions made by real estates on life changing situations.
"Hanging Artworks, owners compelled to fix immediately and work out with builder etc on who to pay. "
Owners and Kandlordsrepresentative agents need to respect the lessor as legal occupant if the property and not demand access all the time. Rather prompt addressing of maintenance and condition of property should occur. 
"The way the RTA dispute resolution process works is absolutely disgusting, it is all one sided always in the favor of the landlord even with hard core evidence photos emails and written agreements, they count and mean nothing.The dispute mediation officers act as if we are at an ""auction"", they encourage to make offers of money from the bond to make it go away-exact words used ! It is disgusting. Tenants have NO RIGHTS! Going to tribunal is costly and stressful on the tenants, and that should be a very last option. The RTA mediators are useless.... "
"Creating guidelines for agents to follow when tenants are vacating a premises, such as what they can reasonably request from a bond to cover the cost of repairs.
It seems to have become a bit of a routine in Queensland where the agent will state that an exorbitant cut of the bond will be taken in order to cover arbitrary costs, and when challenged on it, these costs disappear. "
"Landlords more accountable for water and living standards to meet codes. Eg. All houses to properly fenced, 5 star water ratings etc"
Frequency of routine inspections. 
Tenants have too many rights to damage your property and not leave when instructed.
Pets allowed no matter what
"Lower prices, everything is way too expensive "
The ability to be on a month to month lease if you are a good tenant.
Mandatory pets allowed 
"1. Clear timeline to when things should get sorted.
2. Property agents should not favour the landlord but have a balance between the both.
3. If things take long to be settled or the quality of the property is reduced, the rent should be reduced to reflect that [It should not be an option].
4. Likewise if the tenant is late in making rent payments, they should be late payment fees to compensate unless it was a one-off
5. Clear understanding between the roles of the Body corporate, property agent and owner. Often it takes weeks to get anything settled and usually the tenants suffer most.
6. The RTA should have more power as its currently toothless.
7. The RTA should have a hotline proving advice to tenants and owners alike."
"Treat renters as customers, not as a commodity"
The power of the real estate agents.!
Making it easier to break lease when personal situations change
Being able to put pictures on walls 
That both tennant and landlord have to sign the bond claim form.  To stop deception and false claims
Transparency of decision making regarding who is chosen for renting applications.
"Leases arnt fixable or secure. I agree with giving sufficient notice before leaving  example 3-4 weeks
no security because you never know if you lease will be renewed "
More laws to protect tenants. 
"Ensure repairs are completed as a mandatory minimum before tenants move in or within a maximum time frame, as to avoid tenants receiving a 'pest' status. "
"Making it possible for responsoble pet owners to apply and get approved for rentals. Pets bring great happiness and, for some people, are the only form of companionship that someone has."
No discrimination against pets. If something is damaged even without pets bond gets taken or u go to court for it. If your a responsible pet owner it won't smell/have any damage. 
"Break lease rules, issues with application approval while on maternity leave"
Landlords to listen to the tenants and improve the facilities.
"The cost- prices are so variable
The quality of houses"
"Have real estate agents uphold agreements and communicate the situation, and having the owner accountable.  "
The way landlords treat tenants. We need to be their priority because with out us they don’t have an income 
"More tenancy freedom (hanging pictures, TVs (within reason)) and less discrimination against pet owners. "
I gave the owner a 2 page letter almost begging to be allowed to have an indoor animal (little dog) as my daughter was suffering through a major emotional and mental breakdown.  Animals are said to significantly help those with mental health issues and so in my letter I stressed this to the owner.  They would not allow any pets at all and I feel that my daughters mental health could have been helped if they just showed some compassion.  They used the excuse that an animal would be too messy. Why do I NEED to have the approval of an owner to get a pet if carpet cleaning and pest control upon vacancy is already written into my lease??!
"Ability to have long term leases, 2 to 10 years, at fixed amount."
Relationship with real estate
"Being treated like a human, not some piece of scum"
Fairer choices for renters and renters should be given more say
"The application process can be difficult, especially if there are several people wanting the same property. Also my rent goes up between $10-$15 every year! My wages haven't, makes things tight at home."
Rental agents actually doing their jobs properly. 
A 'no surprises' approach to receiving a bond refund at the end of a lease - cleaning and maintenance expectations are not made clear on lease agreements. Bond is automatically placed into dispute by some rental agencies even before a final inspection has taken place.
A fairer rental exit process. 
"As someone unable to have children, I would feel less discriminated against if it were illegal for lessors to turn away families with pets. For me, pets are the only children I can have."
The ability to make minor fixes around the house
Owners dont fix things
Houses should HAVE to have adequate pest control maintained. 
Regulations  on the price of rent  and the state of the homes
Have a landlord who was more open to pets 
I think the lease agreements. I think more people should offer 3 month leases. 
Fewer inspections and more maintenance being done on time
The ability to have the right to break lease without penalty if the house I’m renting is put up for sale. 
Owners selling their units/houses when there is still a lease in place. 
More time with lease changes to find alternative accommodation if needed
"Mandatory Solar & Insulation installed at rental properties

"The land lord calling my work place , informing them when I get delayed . "
Real-estate to remove adds from rent.com  and the likes once an application has been accepted. 
Ridiculous breaches just for the sake of them. 
make sure those that have been black listed for not paying rent are kept on a list until they meet their debts
Not having to sign a lease every year ongoing until notice to vacate or leave from tenant or owner 
Cheaper rent and more properties for pet owners 
Better communication between tenants and property managers. Maintenance issues dealt with on time.
The selection process of people trying to rent. 
Guarantee that the property will not be put on the market during the lease period. 
Flexibility with timeframes in finding suitable & available properties with more options on bond payments
More leniency on rules depending on the person/family renting and their background. 
More options for lower income earners
"Longer lease , more rights to make it a home , less power to landlords "
Solar panels on rental properties 
"At the lend of the lease period, it is very hard to co-ordinate a rental in a new premise that matches up closely to the end date - I would propose that an existing tenant should be allowed to extend stay past the lease period for a period of 14 (or even 28) days to increase flexibility. This would make a big difference.  "
Two things. Pet disclosure should be provided after an application is accepted it should not be a deciding factor for the owner (I own 3 properties myself). I should not have to seek approval to hang items on the wall. The landlord should be protected by the bond for an damage by me regardless of the cause. 
Allow dogs in more rental properties 
Landlords abiding by legislation
"Only twice yearly inspections.

"
"The fact that property managers take photos of your contents during inspections, in the interest of the Owner. Its creepy and put into the wrong hands, its a shopping list of what is in your place."
"When problems arise, such as landlord refusing or being tardy with repairs, the only choice is to issue notice to remedy breach & then to leave if nothing is done. No compensation to tenant for costs for leaving etc"
"More open communication with tenants on behalf of the renting body 
More control over your surrounds - e.g. I do not smoke or wish to live near a smoker, but it blows in through my window every day thanks to my neighbours in another complex. Lose all the freedom you would have as a homeowner about your surroundings."
Bond to held by a third party (eg. Rental Tenancy Agency) and not landlord/estate agent. 
That the agents be forced to take my privacy more seriously.
"More regulation for real estate agents. They should be required to have a law degree in order to fully understand the tenancy act. 
There is also a total disregard for the tenant livelihood. Many real estate agents believe all tenant are tarred with the same brush. They are often disrespectful towards the fact that while the tenant does not own the property, it is their home."
Get rid of 100 I’d point system or same system across all rental agents
More legislation in the tenants field rather than all for the owners.
Real estates being on the side of the renter when it comes to maintenance issues not the owner
Make it easier to contact owner in case of things breaking etc.
For real estates to let tenants sign 12 month lease straight up 
The owners need to fix problems in a timely manner 
stop the harassment from the agent to get me to commit to signing the lease 8 weeks prior to end of tenancy
To have more viewings outside 9-5 as not everyone can view houses during those hours especially being a full time worker. Also less cancellations to viewings of homes as often you make arrangements to be able to view the house at the time and day specified. 
The right to privacy and more choice
"Be able to put up art or photos on the wall.
Australia has a lot to learn from overseas "
Timely repairs to property. 
Force landlords to approve property managers decisions to claim against a bond/go to QCAT over an issue. Property managers clearly cannot be trusted to make these decisions honestly and often do so maliciously without the landlords' knowledge/approval.
Better Property Managers
The two weeks notice to three weeks like so many other states.
Having communication to the owner directly.
The real estate company to respond to me. Only having one person to deal with and not multiple people
"Level of communication and interaction with Property Manager.

"Online access to your full rental history, online forms that the RTA can monitor, e.g. forms lodged to rela estate regarding repairs required on the property. Maybe utilising mygov to create an online service"
The ability to get out of a lease  due to mold and damp occpuring and not being told about it
Rental prices are to high compared to income
Landlords cannot stop people from having pets as long as they do not damage the property and follow council guidelines. They should pay a pet bond (2 weeks) but cannot be refused pets. 
To hold real estate to a level of ethical behaviour that none currently do. Real estate agents and in most cases landlords bully and victimise renters with absolute impunity of being prosecuted by either the authority (RTA) or by their own ability to fund their own legal response. Real estate agents make it their primary focus to profit from renters. They regularly use every dirty trick in the book to hold renters to unfair terms of contracts so they can increase their personal gains and power over renters under the threat that the renter will be black banned by the real estate agent.
Agents don’t care about us eg we have been waiting almost 2 months to have a pool gate fixed . They kick us out if we complain.
More pet friendly rentals 
If they are selling the rental they walk all over you they should cover all expenses if you have to move if your lease is not up
Making it easier for young people to get into affordable rental properties that aren't eith run down or long distances from their workplace
Automated responses with no reply option from Real Estates (email & text message)
Making property managers more responsible for replacing like for like when conducting repairs and an easier way to get them to do repairs on time 
been here for 3yrs now and had no problem renting when I applied.
Tenants should be able to break lease without financial penalty if they give reasonable notice.  It took 10 weeks for my agent to find a new tenant and I gave them 4 wks notice. RTA were not supportive I felt.  QCAT ordered part of my bond be given to the agent -$1000.  That equated to rent equivalent to 3 weeks extra rent IN ADDITION to my four weeks notice I gave them.  Agents can be incompetent and still take all the power and all my money.  Laws need to be changed for greater fairness and flexibility to tenants who try to do the right thing and get taken advantage of.
"The way Real Estate treat people who have tried to do the right thing and they with hold over paid rent  for weeks and months, when we need to pay another Real Estate. Also some hold you to ransom with your bond because they don't understand or follow the rules about what is genuine wear and tear .Tenants don't seem to have any real help with dealing with these type of problems with nasty Real Estate Agents."
The quality of real estates is pretty low. I’ve been with lax property managers in all three non-privately owned paces I’ve stayed. With the last lot of agents being unhelpful most the time and on occasion rude. 
Legislation to protect landlords
Photographs taken only if you have damaged the or neglected the rental property. Photos taken every single inspection is an invasion of my privacy especially when there are no incidents to declare. 
"When rental prices drop, owners can refuse under lease agreement to lower rent cost to appropriate market prices "
More affordable rental properties
"That owners, who are not property experts, are involved in the rental process at all. I.e involved with deciding rental increases based on their greed or limited knowledge of the market instead of a fair market appraisal. "
"The ridiculous rules on house inspections.
I’m sorry someone lives here and the exhaust fan has a little fluff on it."
If there was a safety payment when finacial hardship hits a renter or a insurance scheme for sudden financial hardship that creates stress and potential homelessness and blacklisting.
The option for long term leases should be available for more security
"What’s happening.
Property management has far too much power. 
Realestate agents have the power to affect many families by making snap judgments of people. 
What needs to change? 
Families/ individuals/young and old 
We all need a roof over our head. That a basic need. 
Rental prices need to be capped. The government could buy more housing for families to rent through the affordable housing scheme. Leaneancy for families that have struggled financially. "
Bullying attitude of agents
More properties that accept small dogs and being able to hang pictures with 3M style hangers (accepting the responsibility for any repairs if necessary) without having to ask permission each time.  
"That rent doesn't keep going up as a property ages & does not meet the price that is expected just automatically.
Better loyalty from landlords for good long term tenants"
Change the frequency of inspections (i.e. no more than 3 per year).
That owners are limited in the amount they can increase rent each year. 
The length of the lease needs to be increased and the notice to vacate given by the landlord also needs to be lengthen.
Reduce inspection to twice a year. Real estate agents need to be more responsive and proactive when attending to maintenance requests. Correct forms should be given to tenant upon exit and agents should allow tenants reasonable time to fix state of property back to reasonable conditon.
Probably the process from applying to approval could be a lot more transparent 
"Agents were appalling. Rude, gave ultimatums, totally inflexible. Made it very hard to move from interstate. Too much power for people with minimal education. "
Access to appropriate accomodation at more affordable cost.
Not allow people on parol be allowed to move in with out constantion of the other tenants and owners 
I hate the three monthly inspections when I’m a great tenant I treat the place like my own and take care of it but with my health I suffer anxiety and every six months would be better 
"The ability to hang pictures etc on walls without gaining permission for each one. Being able to have a pet, though I do believe a tenant should return property in good condition and a pet bond should be in place. Fewer inspections after proving yourself a good tenant and long term leases for stability. "
improve and respect tenants rights
Regulations around landlords and real estate agents
A bit more power to resolve maintenance issues faster.
Better communication between tenents and real estate/ property owners. Inspections / entry requests are often last minute and poorly communicated. 
"Tennants to be seen as customers by estate agents in the same manner as the owner of the property is perceived. Estate agents should be able to initiate necessary repairs without consent of the owners, who , often , after having received the request drag their feet and ignore it.  Long term 10 year leases should be an option and no fault evictions outlawed. "
A standardised application and real estate communication guideline for repair and dispute resolution. 
"Price. The price of rentals is out of control.
Also the application process is to invasive. Having to show bank statements is i feel a breach of my privacy. It's nobodies business what mine or my partners income is. We wouldn't apply for a house we couldn't afford to rent. People need to stop being treated like we're all stupid."
Timely repairs when requested.
"Ensuring that businesses operating near residences do not cause excessive noise and nuisance to tenants right to peace and privacy. We have a production company next door to our residence that runs throughout the night with large trucks coming and going, machinery being operated, employees yelling, non-stop loud beeping from vehicles that we are constantly being woken 7 days a week often between 3 - 5am, cannot have our windows open and cannot enjoy any peace or privacy."
"Having to remove hooks when moving, when in reality the next tenet is going to want hooks up too. "
To have more equality in the power balance I feel owners have more rights than renters - rewards for good tenants.
For realestate agents to be more truthful to tenants and owners when asked to do repairs on a property 
Property managers do not seem to listen to tenants requirements
spending more time looking for a place to rent
More realistic pricing  on properties 
Agents/owners not forcing me to renew fixed term rentals 1 or 2 months in advance or giving notice to leave.
More rules for real-estate agents too stop them from lying to both tenants and landlords. Make them have to disclose everything up front and if they don't they should face charges.
Land tax rules restrict property ownership in Qld.
Increase bond to six weeks rental.  Stop Government bond loans.
Landlords made to fix there properties when reported. Not a temporary fix which becomes permanent and done by handymen not tradesman
Quicker repairs / servicing / maintenance 
"The 3 month inspection should be only be every 6 month once you renewed your lease. When asking for some improvement or to fix something broken, not to take to any longer than two weeks."
Non discrimination for pet ownership 
4 to 6-monthly inspections instead of 3-monthly
Bond return process - it's too in favour of the property manager / owner.  Should be a time limit on how long they have to submit a  $$ figure that they do not agree to return as bond.  The balance should then be released to the tenant.
For landlords to be alot more accountable for maintenance of a property 
Limit rent increases to no more than 10%
Giving tenants more control/power. Unfortunately this year we have had a bad experience with real estate agents 
Real Estates professionalism 
There is no definition of normal wear and tear. Every rental agency acts like a criminal within law. 
"Any reform that seeks to shift the balance of current policy and rules in favour of the tenant, and remove my rights and ability to determine and impose requirements regarding the tenancy of my property, would immediately cause me to remove one of my  properties from the rental market. As a home owner, I should retain some rights to decide who, and under what conditions and restriction I choose to impose on future rental agreements. 

Tenant always retain the right to make an informed decision with full disclosure of these conditions made in the tenancy agreement. They should not dictate to me those conditions and arrangements under which I lease my property. Any such proposal is rubbish. 

I do not support options to allow tenants to paint or otherwise make modifications to rental proprieties. Tenant should continue to be liable to make good any such damage or alterations. Allowing animal should remain at the discretion of the land lord. "
To make sure that the owner of the property follows the rules in regards to the rta.
"Stability around rental pricing, not subject to unreasonable rental hikes to to industry peaks, especially in regional Mining areas."
Equally for larger families 
Realestate’s understanding legislation and abiding by it. 
Easier access to rental properties that allow pets.
I rent an apartment and the neighbours have their music up really load. Better screening of tenants. Give clear guidelines about noise 
End of tenancy procedure. 
Provide onus on builders and owners to ensure that the property is long lasting and hard wearing. The amount of time and inconvenience that results from cheap and shody building materials is unacceptable. 
Ease pet regulations. 
"I think it very much depends on the market. I have had a good experience recently when I moved to a new rental, because there are so many properties available. I find when the market is tougher for tenants, you are treated with less respect by property managers (eg. Showing up late to appointments, taking one week to manage significant maintenance issues). "
"The ability to ask for 6 month lease without owners or agents saying we’d prefer a 12 month contract, knowing that if you say 6 month lease preferred the likelihood of being turned down is quite high. "
More allowance for pets in a rental property. Less restrictions on pets. More communication from rental agencies
Not enough properties accept pets
"Private renting, make it tougher for landlords tenants in by not allowing them to rent without agreements etc."
Fair rules and regulations
Rental managers seam to be the weak link in the rental chain I have been left less than satisfied with the constant change over of managers which leaves gaps in continuity and arguments over the actual state of the property due to miss management and inaccurate record keeping by rental agencies 
More affordable options for low income earners
"More flexibility or control with rental payments.  
Having Online access and being able to pay for weeks in advance and then holding off the payments.  

As long as your payments are kept up to date and you pay for each week you reside, I don’t see a problem. "
"Make the property managers obey basic laws. Amber Werchon in Mooloolaba systematically disregarded them, frequently entering illegally and trying to charge me the same fees multiple times. Whenever I raised their behaviour with them, they responded things like ""our agents will do their inspection when it's convenient for them"" - which may be a week earlier than their notice says! They knew there was no recourse for me as a tenant and took full advantage of it."
Tenant protections are insufficient. Owners are favoured.
Given the option upfront to pay via direct debit/bpay instead of the agencies way which involved high fees. 
"Very competitive rental market, and applicants are not treated fairly and with respect."
"If you ask for repairs that it is done, not we will get round to it or no respoce from the owner."
More realistic/cheaper rental pricing 
"Sell my properties.  It is far too difficult to go through the processes involved to evict a tenant, even if illegal activity is deemed to be taking places at the premises."
"longer contract more then 12 months   .Owner should be forced to fix after three request .. Should NOT BE ALOUD TO SELLER WHILE  STILL BEING RENTED UNLESS TO SOMEONE WHO INTEND TO KEEP RENTING THE PROPERTY  TO THE TENANT                     
"
Property managers need to have more remorse when new tenants move into new places. Especially when they haven’t been cleaned.
The outgoing inspection/fair wear and tear
No discrimination against pet owners.
More things fixed on building.
"My current renting experience is great - we have resident managers in an apartment, However, previous experiences through commercial real estate agents have been patchy. Often they are not responsive to requests and things aren't handled in a timely manner.
I'd like to see options for longer lease terms. I know in Europe where renting is more common, multiple year leases are the norm, it would be good for renters to have that kind of security here too."
Rent going up every new contact and the invasion of privacy all the time for inspections esp after living in same house for 3 years is ridiculous. Yearly is enough. 
"As a landlord, tenants that trash your house should have to pay for the entire repair bill. Not just loose their bond!"
"Allow termination for illegal activities, property damage and significant disregard for lease conditions."
More maintance and safer houses to live in. We have house inspection yet nothing gets fixed! 
The fees of renting and having to do cheques for water bills should be taken out with rent 
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T OWN THE PROPERTY I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL RESPECTED AND FEEL THAT IT IS MINE BUT THAT IS NEVER THE CASE AS CONSTANT DISTURBANCES AND NOISE FROM OTHER TENANTS IS NEVER HANDLED BY AGENTS AS THEY DON'T CARE SINCE THEY DON'T LIVE HERE AND DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT.
After a 12 month lease requested a shorter lease as we were considering purchasing a property and didn’t want to be locked into another 12mth lease. Without any further consultation or communication the following day received a notice to leave and the property was advertised on the net with open home times. We had never missed rent & the house was immaculate. This was devastating to be uprooted not to mention the additional costs associated with moving. 
"Exit fees are ridiculous , things happen in everyday life , either you are bankrupt or unable to pay rent further , instead of leaving immediately , till the date of rent is paid , making a poor person pay for the whole term of contract is a bit too much "
"There is 1 month notice when the tenant is leaving the rental property but when looking for a place to rent the availability is in 2 weeks only or putting an application now without bing sure to be chosen by the owner. 
This put the tenant in a stressful situation where he has given notice to leave his rental place but cannot find anything before 1 to 2 weeks before because the place is vacant.
The rule should be when a tenant give notice of leaving the rental place, this property should be straight a way on the market for other people to look, apply and organised their moving with a reasonable time frame."
Communication between real estate and tenants 
Faster action to remove problem tenants.
"When the property is up for sale, need to limit the number of inspections. This happened to me recently. Inspections were twice weekly for nearly 2 months. Major inconvenience and invasion of privacy."
Limit intrusive inspections and agents photographing house every 3 months.
"Maintenance , pet conditions,  notice times for entry when we work full time "
Better trained management agants
Obtain quality tenants that don’t cause thousands of dollars in damage and get away without paying owed rent. 
Frequency of routine inspections once living at a property for a long time 
Better kept records at realestate especially when dealing with a revolving door of management. Less aggressive correspondence when sometimes they’re in the wrong but they still come on too strong and are mildly offensive. 
Rental Bond should be a minimum of three months rent
Ensure agents and landlords don’t treat all renters like criminals. 
6 monthly inspections instead of 3 monthly. Leasing agent to ask questions before accusing tenants and sending breaches. Rent prices are way too high
"Longer leases
Being able to have pets inside in all rental houses"
"Greater security and protection for people renting....not being subject to yhe whims of landlords moving back, selling the house etc.."
Making sure all locks to the property are changed by owners or investors
Property managers should understand that the home belongs to the property owner and it is the property owner who pays their commission
Real estate lack of action for required repairs. It took over 2 years before action was taken to fix a dangerous power point.
Remove the 100 point of I’d from rental applications
Make rental applications a little more easier. The amount of documents needed is obscene and invasive 
"I would like things to on a Level playing ground,like knowing all about a landlord e.g.: if they maintain the property,fix things when needed,not putsure rent up all the time."
As a landlord I have to give 2 months notice but tenants only give 2 weeks.  Tenants can break a lease and choose not to mediate leaving it to go court or nothing.
Real estate in very reluctant to refund bond always making excuses to deduct maximum amount from bond.
Ability to complain about a landlords breach of lease. 
"Making a clear list of what you can and cannot claim against entry and exit reports. 
Some real estates say if you have to look at an angle for damage then it’s not reportable. "
Remove the restrictions on pets. 
"Some flexibility that will allow tenants to move if at least the reason why is beyond their control or for a job. Sometimes a job comes up somewhere outside where you are renting,at a time where you can be in the middle of your lease. For you to be charged for advertising and continue to be charged the rent until someone else occupies it,  makes it difficult. "
Put regulations on real estate agent in regards to putting up rental amounts regularly since this puts constant pressure on tenants and tenants need to move often which costs lots of money for the tenant and does not provide a stable environment for children of tenants. Also for example putting regulations on only giving out 6 months lease in order to push up rent six months later. 
The need to come up with 4 weeks bond when moving house when instead you should be able to transfer it. Moving is expensive enough.
Entry and exit reports
"More accessible viewing times with a quicker outcome. It can take weeks from the first call to arrange a viewing before you get a date and then another week or more to find out if you have been successful.
Also some of the places which still have tenants are disgusting filthy, I would be appalled if I was an owner to see the state if the premises and the agents are showing prospective tenants through "
"The cost of property’s needs to go down, get rid of carpet in rental properties"
Don’t rent though remax Toowoomba 
"Having a contract stating what percentage of rent each tenant will pay, so that only the person not paying their share receives a breach etc."
"Make the realtors be more considerate of renters, the Special Conditions are unfair. It shouldn't be so difficult to have a pet when renting, and it shouldn't matter whether the pet lives indoors.  Pets are part of the family."
Make sure there are fans in all bedrooms at least
More flexibility to breaking a lease.
"Real estates need to chill a bit, they can go over board with inspecions etc. They also don't get things done as far as maintenance is concerned in a timely manner.  "
For the property managers to actually act in a prompt manner when there is an issue. We have been in our current rental for 3 mths & we are stilll waiting for the maintenance man to fix the problems we called to their attention when we moved in. One of them being a smoke alarm being present where there was an empty bracket for one in the area of the house our daughter sleeps in. We ended up fixing it ourselves but havnt had time to fix the broken sleepers in the yard that have rusty nails sticking out of them. We are professional business owners in our 40's & are sick of being treated like juveniles whenever we have an issue. We have been home owners for some time & we have been landlords & have recently moved to the sunshine coast & our experience with rentals & property managers has been absolutely awful. We understand completely what is expected of us & also of our property managers / owners.
Having to give tenants 2 months notice to quit when they are week to week
Increased professionalism from the real estate agents
"Greater transparency between body corporate decisions and tenants, and the ability of tenants to be involved in body corporate matters."
Less government interference.  More responsibility for costs on tenants.  User pays
Getting the landlord to do basic maintenance
Give rental managers and landlord a rating we as tenats are rated why not land lord and rental mangers. I had some real bad land lords and rental mangers. At the moment i have one of the best rental mangers and landlords i dont want to move
Regulated and industry trained property managers
"The way in which tenant's are treated by the real estate agent's.  I have always paid the rent on time, never damaged the property, and yet have been treated like a second class citizen by the real estate agents when vacating the property's at times. An example - I have received property's in filthy conditions, including with rodent droppings, yet have been demanded to return to property's to clean 'fluff off a corner of the floor'.  
"
Allow dogs inside the house and lower rent 
The legislation is poor and unfair for the lessors. For example tenants can stop paying rent for several weeks before legal action can be taken. 
I have had very good experiences thus far so wouldn’t change anything.
"Lower rental rates, longer leases."
Real Estate agents treating renters as scum. My husband and I are older and have been unlucky enough that we have to rent. The treatment from most Real Estate agents is terrible. Treating us as 2nd rate citizens. 
Ability to transfer bond directly between tenancies
Better understand rental agencies and their contracts
It should be easier to leave a current fixed term lease early when owner has decided to sell or demolish the property. Timing an end of lease with moving in to a new property is not always optimal.
If I could hang my own pictures and paintings on the wall
Easier for pet owners to secure rentals
"Greater fairness for owners. Tenants can give 2 weeks notice to leave and owners two months, even though the tenant may have been causing damage to the property or not paying rent as per their agreement. Additionally going through the court system a tenant can bankrupt themselves so they do not have to pay for lost rent and damage when the decision is not in their favour."
Being able to get owners to clean the property properly before I move in.
"Remove the bias against tenants in court.
Landlords can go to court, lie and get away with it."
"More, clear, legislation around co-tenants/sharehousing. To give both realtors/landlords and other tenants more rights to chase co-tenants who refuse to pay their rent. Currently, there is little to nothing co-tenants can do outside of QCAT. "
"Longer lease possibilities 
Pets
"
Not giving tenants as much rights as they have. Owners have all the debt and outlay.outlays 
"rental prices are too high
utility prices are too high"
"Price and quality don’t match 
Lot of wasting times 
Treatment of the agents 
Issues not solved from beginning 
PRICE WAY TOO HIGH!!"
For Rent Managers to treat renters like decent human beings... and not abuse their power of authority.

More heavily regulated real estate agents - total bunch of coy boys in the QLD they do what they like when they like and how they like regardless of legislation 
Being able to decorate as I like
To have more certainty that you can continue to live there at the end of .
Being able to talk to real estate property manager instead of getting the run around 
Better communication with tenants. Even a text message to confirm progress. I had vandals smash my front screen door and it took 3 weeks to replace. Could be to do with better communication from real estate to owner of the house? 
Properties are not getting maintained to a decent standard.  Property owners dont want to spend money.......

"Making rentals more affordable for low income households, especially considering that the Department of housing properties are so hard to come by."
"Real estate agent staff. Improving their responses to issues, and understanding of tenants rights and responsibilities. "
"I think the owner /real estate agent have too much power. It shouldn’t be to tough on renters, the reason we are renters is because we couldn’t afford to buy, should have mutual understandings on this instead of Mekong the renters pay pay and pay for everything they touch, like I have o pay for new plants, Because they died?"
Quality of property managers. Improve consistency across providers.
Stop raising it every six to twelve months . Longer leases 
Having Realestate’s actually doing their jobs properly 
Some rental companies have massive rules and regulations that seem that they are in a dictatorship for the smallest things like Christmas lights on their properties and proper picture hooks that are able to be taken down.
Allowing pets as an option when renting
"System real estate agents using to track payments or to make records re property.
Also they should be more friendly to tenants and treat them with a respect."
Management agents requiring to share records better with the next management agency
When asking for repairs on property and waiting for owners to decide if they want to fix the problem. This can take weeks. 
quality of repairs. speed of repairs . communication between property managers and tenants . 
As an owner I believe that the liability of the tenant should be greater in regard to damage. I have had two properties trashed and the tenant get off scot free.
Tenants remaining for length of lease
Increased collaboration between tenants and agents.
"Not waiting so long for maintenance. 
Standards for plumbing, taps, running water, size of water heater. "
Better balance of landlords' rights when compared to tenants' rights
Better communication of rent rates by suburb and size of property.
"Honest real estate agents
"
"Require real estate vendors to disclose in writing the intended longest length of the lease/rental period and disclose if the property has previously been listed for sale by the current owner.

Pets being always allowed 
Some rental agencies need to be held accountable for their actions. also we should be aloud 7/14 days before reporting things found wrong with the property that are not listed. 
Make sure most properties are pet friendly 
Renters rights when owners wish to undertake renovations 
"More rights for renters regarding private rentals so owners honour repair requests & cant appear at properties unannounced.
"
Independant inspections for the entry and exit condition reports. Much like the UK. I am an Inventory Clerk and ex-Property Manager.
Conditions of animals inside
Affordability. Accessing good housing. Dealing with reasonable landlords. 
Harshness of inspection standards
"Online applications that can be submitted prior to inspection or on the spot

All qld rentals should be required to have air conditioning installed. It was 37 degrees today & summer hasn’t even started! 

More current or different options/conditions to break leases"
"There are too many inspections. I understand some renters may require closer monitoring, however if the tenant has been in the property 6 months with excellent record, then inspections should only bec6 monthly "
"Reduced Rent
Property managers that actually care
Quick response to requests for repairs
To be treated with respect"
Pet allowances - not enough properties allow pets.
Longer periods between rental increases
"Owners have to fix problems in the house or they have to forfeit payments, meaning discount the rent until fixed"
Return of rental bond before the next rental bond needs to be paid. 
Allow us to improve the premises more 
Personality clashes with realtors 
Stop the real estate from taking photos of every room every time they come to check the house.
I have been renting the same property for 2.5 years and I think every 3 months for a rent inspection is far too often after being there so long with no problems 
"For properties to be clean and in good order, to move into, the same expectation for the renter as for the agent, when vacating "
Cost and availability of rental for low income and pensioners
longer period between inspection and lease renewal 
"I believe that after a rental tenant vacates a property, the owner of the property needs to come through the property and do a visual Inspection and fix any general maintenance issues, ie- painting, renovations, updating, carpets replaced  etc. 

After every tenant leaves this should be done. 
I also believe the there should be a rule set in place for owners to have to paint the inside/ and or the outside of the property every 2-3 years. Also the same for carpets. Rental properties generally have cheap paint jobs and carpet installed meaning these things do not last as along and need replacing on a more regular basis. "
"'- Able to get repairs/maintenance done directly with tradespeople when/if necessary. 
- Animals allowed by default. 
"
"Make inspections less often, currently every 3 months.  Inspections should be about checking there is no damage etc not being told to ensure beds are made and there are no dishes in th sink"
Changes are needed urgently to stem the 'airbnb' blight that is serious hampering locas from finding good placed to rent and live.
Regulation of property managers to ensure quality of service to landlords and tenants
"Allowing to hang pictures on walls consideration for rates between rent prices and how much all total is because people are struggling to pay rent, water, power and gas rates all together 
Animals should be allowed in any rental house we were lucky to be allowed our dog
6 monthly inspections would be better I know it’s to find out if any maintenance needs to be done but that’s what maintenance reports are for and it feels like an invasion of privacy 3 months go by really quick 
Pest control should be kept up to date by the owners not renters unless moving out
Take more consideration in wear and tear of a house and stop trying to claim on it when people move or breaching because of it 
"
Bond and payment in advance 
"Make tenants liable, beyond the amount of bond held, for cost of property damage they cause"
Real estate agents acknowledgeing me as a human & an equal
Clear documentation of what is required and costs of such at end of term set out at the beginning so the agent/landlords cannot make unreasonable demands upon end of tenancy. 
I'd prefer to rent through an agency versus directly from the landlord 
Properties to be cleaned at the correct standard by tenants 
More open mindedness about pets & less strict rental history
"More affordable rentals 
More rentals that allow pets 
"
rent assistance should be paid directly to the landlord
Longer term leases and more competent real estate staff
It should not be so difficult to rent with animals in apartements or townhouses. Animals a lot of the times are less disruptive and distructive than children. 
Renters should have more rights when it comes to owning pets and maintaining the property. 
increased speed in rectification of issues
Better communication with rental agencies
Property managers being more regulated and better equipped. 
"I have only just heard of this survey and I would have prepared a written submission had I known earlier. I frequently move for work and am across the renting landscape, which leaves little to be desired. Enforcement of agents' and owners' duties under the Act: particularly, depositing bond with RTA, providing accurate and timely condition reports, conducting exit inspections within a reasonable time and providing the bond return form, the list really does go on. "
That non urgent repairs are carried out quickly. 
"More pet friendly properties, introduce a ""pet bond"" for animals so landlords can have funds to repair any damage caused by pets  this in turn will make renters more conscientious about keeping their pets in line"
Things need to be fixed quicker when u r renting 
"Applications for rentals are the hardest part of the renting process. All real estates require different amounts of information. I believe for this system to be improved completely the RTA should have a system where tenants can create profiles, link references from previous real estates, rental history and in\identification documents. Renters could then submit their profile to the real estate as an application. A system like this if used by all real estates would make the renting process universal and easy. 

I typically believe that property managers do not provide an adequate service for the renters. In my experience, after the initial inspection, I have not seen the property manager again throughout the lease. Most routine inspections have been performed by another employee of the real estate. At lease renewal times, property managers are able to put pressure on tenants, I have had property managers try to pressure us into agreeing to over 10% increases in rent before even speaking with the owner to determine the price changes. In this instance the owner was actually happy to continue with a 3% increase. 

I think property managers have a lot of power over tenants towards the end of leases when tenants are considering renewing. My current property manager has contacted me to advise of lease ending in two months and with an offer of renewal. Having 7 days to reply is adequate when conditions are similar, however real estate use this short period of time to propose larger rent increases and put pressure on tenants who now only have 7 days to decide if the increase is worth it or not. I think property managers should be required to allow tenants 14 days to reply to renewals/ lease ending emails. "
"That the facilities and communal grounds be kept with a bit more care eg: gardens to be maintained, pool to be cleaned more often now we are in the hotter months and the small barbecue area to be upgraded as it is not useable at all."
"1，need more bond money.
2, easier ways and shorter time to get rid of bad tenants especially those didn't pay rent on time.
3,easier and more simple methods to chase tenants run away from owing lot of rents."
level the playing field about notice periods... very unreasonable to impose 2 months notice on a landlord at the end of a lease and only 2 weeks for tenants.  It is near impossible to fill a vacancy in 2 weeks
The current balance is about right and I don't feel a need to press for change
"1. Prevent property managers taking photos during Routine Inspections, unless consent is given.
2. Longer time between Routine Inspection Intervals for Long Term Tenants (Limit number or Routine Inspections for a given period)"
Being able to make adaptions to the apartment like decorating. Being able to cut a key for a family member for safety/health reasons. Getting things repaired in a timely manner. Not having to “fight” for anything you ask for like it being clean when you move in. 
"Bond should be more than 4 weeks- some tenants have rent arrears, damaged the property and left the place dirty. The 4 weeks bond is insufficient "
"Even if you are taking very good care of the house as evidenced in the VERY regular inspections, there is no trust or acknowledgement, and no reciprocation from landlords when you request non safety related repairs or improvements."
Not be treated like a second class citizen. Agents treat renters with respect. 
Hard to narrow it down to one thing more about communication between tenants and landlords.
Stricter enforcing of maintenance on property. Both the current and previous landlords (or real estates) were not very responsive to requests for maintenance unless it was an urgent matter.
Being actually treated like you are paying a lot of money and not being treated by idiot property managers like your second rate.
higher building/construction standards
Take matters into my own hands
Streamlining the bond refund and maintenance request processes 
To be treated more like people than money makers. 
As a landlord there is a lot of hold up to getting arrears or evicting damaging tenants
Being able to treat the property as our own within reason.
Not feeling pressured into having to have a bond cleaner
Better understanding of a tenants rights when entering into an agreement and exiting.
Rental agencies to complete a more accurate entry report 
Decrease rental cost. 
Have the option to vet the applicants and request no pets
The way property managers treat tenants. They always seem to ignore tenants and don’t take their concerns seriously 
"Would like repair/maintenance requests taken care of promptly, no stuffing around, even if it's a ""non urgent"" issue - it took several months to have even simple issues like a loose tap looked at and some things still remain broken and some i fixed myself after 4 months. This is just not acceptable."
"I own a number of rental properties but due to my employment location, I have found myself renting from time to time. My experience has been very demoralising and I always felt that I was treated like a second class citizen by the property managers. My income and status as a property owner seemed irrelevant and I was treated like a person who defaulted on their rent and might damage property. "
Improved Property Management Service
Property managers communicating with tenants 
Make Management Company's and Real Estate accountable for there treatment and actions to people who rent.
Better maintenance of houses. There should be more regulations about the state of the houses that owners need to enforce. For example I have waiting 4 months for owners to fix leaking taps and a leaking hot water system. I don’t pay for water but I do pay for the electricity needed to heat the hot water. And the inconciencamce of leaking taps. 
"Being allowed to make a rental more like home, with pets and not being made feel nothing can be personalised. "
Pets allowed at all properties 
"Rental increases - if landlord is happy with tenant & agrees to re-sign lease agreement, no rental increases should be applied. "
Less restrictions on pets in the household. 
All houses should have air conditioning given we pay the electricity bills.
"RIP offs by real estate..they tell lies about the tenancy vacating, take weeks to inspect property then take bond money to have grass cut again etc. 
Real estate dont follow up on maintenance requests, pay full rent for fans, air con, lights that dont work"
Amount of renting inspections and bond to put up
Having to pay for water. If i didn't have to do this it would be great
The rights to safety when renting and security is a issue there needs to be more options for renters.
More flexibility with hanging things on walls and having pets.
"The Body Corporates are lazy in general. I want more clarity on the Form 10 process. The escalation process isn’t documented clearly - which party is responsible for submitting a compliant to the courts? The owner, renter or Body Corporate? "
Have better access or form of communication with the owner of the property. This could work through a monitored website and also provide history of conversation and action taken by the realestate agent. 
"Less bond required, more places allowing pets. "
Being able to hang pictures on the walls
Water consumption and being able to find house without discrimination from agents.
A more balanced level of power between renters and owners/property managers
Would like the landlord be made accountable to ensure upkeep of property. ie fence etc
Landlords need to get some rights back.
As tenants to. be treated with respect and dignity not second class citizens because we rent not own 
"Massive changes to how real estate agents operate, conduct themselves and the rights of tenants"
Make it easier and less costly to evict bad tennants before they destroy the property and become very expensive
Minimum safety standards in rental homes
Less hoops to jump through and more accepting of pets.
Tenants have way too many rights 
"Tenants have no say over who has access and when someone has access to the rented property. It appears that property managers unreservedly trust or couldn't really care less, of the credentials of persons entering the property. Surely this should be arranged at a suitable time and date for both parties as having strangers enter your home when you are not present leaves you vulnerable to all types of theft."
"Lower the renting prices, have a quicker turn around fixing issues around the properties, allowing tenants to hand photos up to make the house more homely and to allow them and their child to express themselves through hanging up photos etc. and more properties allowing for small pets. "
Ensure maintenance issues had to be fixed within a designated time. Not left indefinitely on deaf ears.
Being able to have pets indoors
make more rental property available. 
More control over what we can do to property as a renter
real estate agents to listen to tenants stop dictating terms and conditions as circumstances generally run two ways
Property managers to take more time into the Tennants and be more effective with the property. I have found most realestate agents seem to respond slowly and do not take tennants serious with issues regarding property. I would disagree with receptionists to organise contracts also. I would prefer to contact owners in relation to issues as I feel they would put more care into it. 
"Mandatory minimum standards regarding atmospheric comfort.. ie screens, fans etc."
Have more affordable housing for those on a Pension or New Start. We should not have to pay more than one-third of our fixed income.
"Removing the contractual condition whereby the property manager can takes photos throughout the house and release them to landlords, keep them on file etc. This is an invasion on privacy. Visual inspection and written reporting back to landlords without the need for any pics (unless maintenance required or if any issues) should be sufficient."
Actually get some Rental managers that give a damn about good tenants
Nothing comes to mind at this stage. 
"Being able to Treat the property more like our own, by being able to put nails/screws in the walls, paint (within reason)."
The agents working for both tenants and landlords .. it seems in my experience the agents only want to make the landlords happy and tenants rights just get ignored.
Timeliness of requests for maintenance 
Increase bonds.   4 weeks does not cover much
Train property managers to actually do their job properly without being such assholes about it or not know what they are actually doing and in turn get home owners to actually pay for repairs within a certain budget instead of letting their rentals run down to the ground and in turn creating all these bad tenants!
Vetting of financial capability in managing ones own finances i.e. proven ability to pay bills responsibly by not having a credit rating.
Less frequent house inspections for long term renters.
Real Estates take more responsibility of properties they are managing.
"Rent is too expensive.  My property owner only agrees to essential maintenance but performs zero preventative or renovation maintenance such as painting, carpet replacement or fly screen repairs. The current managing agent knows nothing about me or the fact that I have been an outstanding tenant at this property for 7 years. There have been 4 real estate agency  and several property manager changes. Every time I have to start all over and explain all the same (unresolved) maintenance issues. And I have to have strangers come and ""inspect"" my home every 3 months."
Rules about signing leases and how much you need to sign 
Stop agent  having a god complex
Being treated like a human being instead of a second class citizen like most renters are. 
fees being charged on direct debit of rent
4 inspections per year is too many
Have private landlords be qulified or trained before managing a rental when they have no idea of rta rules compared to a property manager. Brining stress frustration and tension. Then wasting valuable time at qcat to have a aduicator educate them. Grrrh...
"Real estates work in the interest of the tenant as well as the owner, not just the owner."
If owners choose to put their property on the market the tenants should have the right to break lease without incurring break lease expenses.
"Ability to upgrade appliances so as to be more energy efficient even if still functional. Eg. Old fridges, ovens, fans, etc "
Stricter regulation regarding bond returns. The rental agencies don’t seem to have any intention to return them or keep as much as they can
Have more flexibility  I.e. install specially required PowerPoint and more regulation on how often rents can be increased as most people have to rent because they are doing it hard.
Owners have to do maintence work on a regular basis.
Property management that respect the tenant and owners who don’t hire dodgy tradesmen 
all rental properties should be pet friendly  
Having Real Estate Agents that don't turn into the Devil when you are trying to do the right thing. They need to be more accountable to how they treat people.
Being allowed to make minor modifications e.g. installing curtains without permission.  Any evidence (holes etc) are fixed before vacating 
Actually getting a response from an agent before i have to call them 3 times
"Better property managers. Ours and previous ones are nearly impossible to get a hold of to the point of us not having an emergency number to contact. Our car lift recently broke after hours and with no number to call we called the emergency number on the car lift, only to be charged the call out fee for the repair as the property managers deemed it a no -emergency. Not happy to say the least."
Nuthing. Satisfied with it at moment 
Address the imbalance of “power” from property owners to provide tenants with more certainty and the ability to create a more stable and homely environment. 
Property Managers to actively work for the current tenant i.e. scheduling more inpsections to find another tenant when breaking lease
Pets allowed everywhere
Landlords and agents being transparent with communication with tenants as to who is responsible when something goes wrong. ie agent telling tenant they are waiting on answer from landlord when maintenance is taking longer than reasonable. 
Deal direct with owners not via real estate
Allow well behaved pets to all rental prooerties.
"More flexibility with making changes or improvements to the property that would improve quality of life. For example, I believe that curtain rods and picture hanging should be acceptable additions to a property without having to gain permission from the owner. "
I would like a central repository of data so I don't have to muck about getting info for agents. A better bond system also and stop fees to pay your rent. Shops can't gouge but rental agents can?
Change the pet laws - there is no reason for people to be discriminated against because they have pets but it happens all the time
Real estate agents who are proactive in fixing problems 
"If an agent/owner tries to claim deposit that is rejected by the RTA, they pay double the amount they tried to claim from the tenant to the tenant. Rationale: As a matter of course unscrupulous owners and managers make spurious claims against departing tenants as a ""no lose gamble""."
Have Real Estate agents know what they are doing
Quicker action in case of problems.
When something is wrong with the house some Realestate’s make a big deal about something that is a minor fix for them but a major issue with the tenant. I.e - blocked toilets
More leanency when retuning bonds to renters
Be able to go on a list with an agent so they can notify you of upcoming availability properties.
"Real Estate property managers advertising properties to rent when they have already been taken.
I think they need to stop that as we plan our day to book and view the properties."
"Give Landlords and agents a fairer deal. 
upto 6 weeks rental bond.
longer time to pay utilities or better the option to receive an amount e.g $10 per week which may go to RTA or agent for example and then that amount is deducted from tenants portion of utilities. 
In the past I have been left with no rent for upto 6 week when I have real estate badly managing my property in debt for the utilities for my own house and rentals, water excess $2000 and agents not responding to my questions regarding no rent for last 2month. The most common response is either ""I'll get back to you or there is noting we can do the tenant has more rights then you. Take it to QCat but it won't get a hearing until Jan or Feb next year. In the meantime I have 9 holes cut into my walls with a hedge cutter no rent for 6weeks and $2000 water excess. Usuallly it is the police who contacts me first and by this time the tenant have taken down the curtains thrown them and anything else like water pumps garden hoses and the neighbour lawnmower into the car and smashed my windows as the leave.
  Insurance premium and excess are charged for each part of the claim e.g one for each pain of glass another for the stove to be replace or repaired another for the burned flooring which is usually simplied repaired part cut or and a patched put in (downgrading the value of the property) 
      These and other reason too many to list is why I am no longer interested in being a landlord. The government was receiving easy tax from my hard work and years ( now long ago) I was thanked and appreciated even valued and I had several long term tenants of 12years and a little more who I value and was able to go as a reference so they could buy their own house.








"
No fees attached when paying rent through various methods especially when you aren't given a choice of how to pay.
"Freedom to make changes to a property to suit you. Eg additional Power Points, shelving, picture hooks etc. "
More flexibility in rent terms
Being able to personalise the place
Property managers are extremely nice and helpful until you move in then they are the owners minion. Never help or respond to emails. They constantly change and are all the same. 
Allowance of pets inside. Being able to make and improve gardens. Being able to treat the house as a home. 
Weekly cost of renting 
Rta needs to be more fluid in their responses 3 different people 3 different responses 
"Make routine house inspections 6 monthly rather than 3 monthly.  
If a untility (eg Water) is billed to the owner then the owner has a set time frame (say 60 days) from the date of receiving the bill to forward it onto the occupants to recover their funds. Land lords should not be allowed to leave bill recovery to the end of the year and expect tenants to pay the 3 previous water bills for the year right on top of Christmas. So basically landlords to forward utility bills onto tenants in a more timely manner. "
Regulations on what rules onsite managers can make. Ie pest when there arent pets. Changing lightbulbs in ovens. Forcing us to use a specific bond cleaner or they will withhold bond and charge a fee etc
The lack of communication from the Real Estate Agent AND the time it takes to have any maintenance attended to. 
"Property managers appear to be very corrupt when it comes to bond money. They hold large sums of money and demand that tenants pay most of that money to specific cleaning companies with whom they have deals. When refusing to use a specific company or deciding to clean yourself, they make life very difficult. For example, when we refused to use a specific company for a Ray White, independent companies we got quotes from would always ask who the managers were. When we told them, they would double the quote or refuse to take the job, because they stated they know that these managers will always complain until the company gives up and the tenant pays ""their"" cleaners. Another time we had a property manager withhold $980 bond because, although the house was spotless, there was a single moth in the light fitting. Until you make legal threats, they will not budge, and even then they will do their best to call your bluff. I expect a very large number of people leave out of pocket rather than stare them down, lest they get blacklisted."
Owners and agents don’t pay attention and aren’t accountable for repairs/maintenance requests
Being able to have hooks in the walls to hang pictures
Renting can be monitored and paid online (I.e internet banking methods) this way you are able to track your rent and monitor if money is owing etc.
 maintenance repairs to be carried out at a time specified from when a agency/landlord has been contacted not months down the track .. more one on one communication between tenant and landlord/Agent with maintenance repairs..
I don’t think the rental company should also be the ones to sell the house once the owner of the house decides to list it. This has caused a lot of problems for us as renters. 
You can never talk to a person. Everything is automated from getting repairs to complaints. Give renters a phone number to call and talk to a person rather than on line forms
Reduce the number of routine inspections from 3 monthly to 6 monthly for lease terms of 12 months or longer.
"Ability to move house when suites

Ability to have pets"
"As I have a perfect rental record I believe rental inspections should be less often. Definitely every 3 months for inexperienced renters or people with negative records. But if someone has been renting for 20+ years with no negative notices or issues, regular inspections are less necessary in my opinion. "
Quicker & easier to remove non-paying &/or damaging tenants.
"Making the notice times the same for both tenant and landlord. And as some areas are harder to find places to rent, making it a negotiation between the tenant and landlord."
"Real estate agents to be honest, return messages and not try to take your bond, even when you clean the house better than it was when you moved in.
The rules around Fair wear and tear need to be defined better and more assistance to renters when the agent isn’t doing the right thing.
Agents need to stay in their jobs for longer, the turnover is too high"
Rental Agents needing some sort of training and qualification to do the job so that they understand the rental laws and what they mean.
"Enforcing maintenence requests to be completed in a timely manner. Especially in regards to safety. E.g. gutters, broken blinds etc."
"The law is unfair. If the dwelling becomes uninhabitable (we were flooded by raw sewage) all the risk is on the tenant. I phoned the RTA and they advised there is no obligation on the lessor to provide accommodation. They need only waive the rent until the place is made habitable again. The high cost of short term accommodation was on us, the tenants. It left us hundreds of dollars out of pocket. This is just one example. "
Property agents trying everything to take bond. Inspections being passed with no comments and then on departure all the faults brought up
The timeframes in which owners take to fix the things they say they are going to fix.
If applying for a place and get rejected to be given a reason. Was there something in the application that turned them away.
Ensure property owners have the capital to maintain/upgrade their investment properties
Most real state Don’t do the right job
Stress free process to add pets to a current lease 
Better communication from Real Estate Agents and more compliance checks of Real Estate Agents.
To be able to treat my rental property as my home
"Less fees for anything.
Better communication when repairs are reported and needed.
Better power to have owners fix things in a timely manner.

"
Penalties for dishonest property managers. Only the owner can sue under the ACL. The tenant should be able to sue the agency when they stuff up so many things instead of only being able to pursue the owner who has done nothing wrong.
For all companies to have the same way of taking payments and reporting issues within the property so there is a central location for previous problems.
"The bond amount and advance 2-4 weeks rent makes it so difficult each time you move.
It would be so much easier for most people if you could transfer your bond to new property"
Better follow up regarding necessary repairs. 
Schemes to help all uni students not just ones that are eligible for Centrelink
Not having to have four inspections a year with photographs always being taken.
"Less inspections, more privacy, faster response to problems "
Treat owner/occupiers EXACTLY the same as renters with breach notices & evictions if breaches are not complied with.
Ability to break lease without major financial expense if you have rented for more than 12 months at that property. 
How long it takes to be approved - and how you coudl be updated on the application process more seamlessly 
Rules stating you cannot make professional cleaning and/or carpet cleaning part of a lease agreement
Lower rental price
More rights needed for the landlords. More qualifications or training needed for the agents.
"I've dealt with a lot of agents that are quick to punish the Tennant for a slight, but not take responsibility for the errors they make, like failing to issue inspection notices, failing to advise Tennant's when an owner is preparing to sell, taking over 12 months to fix reported things."
"No smoking allowed in units; not in any part of the unit building or grounds, including balconies. "
Being able to transfer bond.
"The ability to leave a rental property prior to the lease ending (having given the notice of intention to leave within the legislative timeframe), without incurring costs for paying the amount of rent up to lease end date or until a new tenant is found.

I felt trapped when I had to give my notice of intentions 2 months before my lease ended constantly. I didn't know what I was going to be doing in 2 months time. Then when I felt I needed to leave 1 month before my lease ended, I was hit with paying for advertising + one week extra rent + rent up until the end of the lease (or a new tenant was found - which is unlikely in a month in the current market). As a result, I ended up ""staying on"", paying for a place I was no longer living in and feeling more trapped and stressed.

Renting isn't easy, because it's not your home, but it's all you can afford. Putting a place up for rent should not be a money grab for the owners/agents to get as much money as possible out of the tenant.
"
Have more time to complete an entry report as it is a very stressful and usually a rushed time when moving in. There’s always something you find after a few days that you wish you’d put on the report. I’ve been caught out a couple of times as I’ve trusted the real estates report and then when I moved out they pointed out things that were there when I moved in but I didn’t specify it on the report. 
"It should be easier to find places to live with pets. We have had difficulty in the past and even though our current home has many issues that the owner isn’t fixing we aren’t confident that we want to move as we don’t think we’ll find another place easily (1 dog, 2 cats, 4 kids)."
The amount of hoops to jump through to get a house
Improve realtor standards 
"The owner be more forthcoming with repairs needed. Things that affect quality of living for the tenant, Not Just those that directly pose a health & safety risk."
Make it easier to remove tenants who are not fulfilling the terms of their lease. 
Lower rent and electricity 
"Owners who don't comply should be financially penalized. The stress imposed on tenants by unfair/uncaring land lords can ruin life for the tenants and it's very traumatic when you're living with sometimes, extreme disharmony. "
"Less inspections after a certain timeframe of leasing and being a good tenant. 
3 monthly inspections is outrageous especially after renting for quite a time."
"More advertisements on what’s available 
Not having to have 6 weeks upfront "
"Regulations put in place for real estate agents to abide by.  Some are great, some are almost corrupt with power. 
Also general wear and tear to be actually taken into account, instead of unrealistic expectations on the tenant. "
Better value for money
Easier process to move from one premise to another in regards to transferring bond.
More pet friendly housing options.
Less restrictive for pet owners in rentals not enough places allow pets
I've only had one problem with landlord/property manager. All the rest have been excellent.
Air conditioning and insulation 
A fence to secure the yard and keep my children safe. 
Less frequent housing inspections. Being present when the apartment is being inspected. Prohibiting unnecessary taking of photographs  by the realtor agent as it impinges on privacy. 
"Feeling valued,  not belittled for having to rent.  "
The attitude of the real estate 
"Create statutory (monetary?) penalties for unlawfully frequent inspections. (I had an experience where this was used to harass me, and the only legal recourse was to stay home, physically bar entry, and call police, according to QLD help line)"
NOT having a rental increase EVERY time a lease is renewed - especially for good long term tenants.
"Removal of name changing fees and payment processing fees. 
Clearer explanations, explanations and rules on noise complaints and other warnings. "
"Make ability to access affordable internet, and individually metered power, a compulsory standard for properties. "
Allow more pet friendly homes. And allow renters to hang some pictures around the home. 
Fixed lease end date; Remove the required two weeks notice by tenant to vacate on the end date. Notice has been given upon entering into the lease agreement. That’s what the end date is for. Notice should only be required if the tenant wants to extend beyond the end date. 
"A consistent Standard set for cleanliness, functionality & tidy gardens. Each time I move the property is left in better condition than when I moved in! It’s very frustrating."
"Acceptance of pets
Repairs being auctioned in a timely manner"
"So many things

So accommodating people are my speciality. Jack Kelly "
"There is currently an oversupply of rental properties in Queensland. I’ve offered under the asked price and for a shorter rental term than the property owner desired and have been successful in obtaining my last two rental properties. This survey seems unneccesary and a complete waste of tax payer money. It may have been relevant 4 years ago when there was an undersupply of rental properties, though that is certainly not the case now. Stop wasting tax payer money with irrelevant surveys."
"Property agents can be excellent,but some can be awful attending to problems."
"Fair rental pricing. 
Even though an area might be more expensive, the actual house/apartment/unit should be what is actually valued. 
The amount of times I have gone to inspect properties available to rent. That have had mould on ceilings from previous water damage, bathrooms that are so outdated and dirty, that they look like you will catch something from it by looking at it. With Kitchens that have little to no space for a household of 3+ bedrooms. 
Like one area might have a beautiful 4 bedroom house with aircon 2 garage 2 and 1/2 bathrooms for $400. Whilst a dingy 4 bedroom 1 bathroom no carpark no aircon, dirty flea infested house goes for $700...? It doesn’t make sense. 
If they want that price they should update and keep up with maintenance so the house is livable. "
Electronic applications should be accepted by all agencies 
My agent and owner’s refusal to perform any maintenance on the house regarding major issues. Better laws in place to protect tenants and stronger obligations for property owners to ensure a living standard for tenants.
Extend duration of leases commonly available from 12 months to 36 months or longer; like Europe.
"More flexible contracts. If contracts are less flexible, at least include a better discount for lump sum payments"
"There is better regulation of real estate managers so that they all act as according to legislation. 

Hard to evict tenants who don’t pay rent. Landlords might own property but can be quickly put into financial hardship if rent is not paid for a prolonged period 

QCAT waiting times are very lengthy to get decisions made "
Being able to have the freedom to put pictures up and make the house a home. 
"Have the agency be more flexible about inspection dates and times, and also more specific on the day so that we don't have to take half a day off work to look after our dog."
Need to increase rents to keep up with the inflation of expenses.  Rents at the moment are going backwards while expenses are still increasing each year
"have a guide for first renters what yo look for in the first inspection before moving in.
e.g if a door dosent close properly note that down so the tenet dosent get blamed for it."
"At the moment renters have to walk a fine line between making ourselves feel like it’s a home and the stress of not wanting to touch or change a thing because it could cost you your bond or use the money to fix too many things when your already in a bind because you are moving out and need that money for the next property so you don’t become homeless. I’m already too worried about hanging pictures unless there is nails, aswell as curtains or anything else because I have enough to deal with making sure my toddler and myself don’t mess anything up or scuff the walls. so I touch nothing sometimes I won’t unpack all my boxes because I don’t even see the point they are not a home it’s just someone else’s house. "
"Rental amounts not affordable for pensioners
We need ample affordable housing"
"Neither of the 2 ""luxury"" units that I have rented in QLD have been professionally cleaned prior to my taking possession. The rents charged for dated units that haven't been renovated with little to no storage are absurdly inflated, I have absolutely no idea what Queensland ""Property Managers"" actually do to earn their wage, but they definitely DO NOT *manage* anything about the property."
Longer leasing agreements for tenants with good rental history ie: 2 or 5 year lease
"Have been a tenant in the same premises for 8 years now, have always looked after the property as our own. However the same owners increase rent 10-20$ per year. Have requested air-conditioning with view to discuss rent changes however nothing has ever come from this. Frustrating now as this will be a deal breaker with lease renewal next year. "
Allow picture hanging on walls
The need for quaterly inspections as I am ALWAYS  a long term tenant and believe if you prove to be a good tenant inspections should be every 6 months. 
Not having the owners/landlords deciding to sell 2 months into a 12 month lease. 
Being able to repaint the place.
force landlords to remedy building faults within 7 days
More quality homes at affordable prices 
"For one I’d make sure that when a tenant is removed from the lease they are removed from the bond. I had an issue where a tenant moved out, I took over full lease as I didn’t have a replacement yet, a year later someone else was added to the lease and a year later we moved out and I didn’t get my bond back, I called and emailed the real estate and they gave me a bull answer so I went in to the RTA to challenge it and they said the bond wasn’t in my name so there was nothing I can do "
"Allow tenants more control while renting. Not just tell them what is happening, include them in decisions."
"Rental company- unprofessional, house was in inadequate state when trying to move in. Terrible experience "
"The price of rent. It's too expensive for these cheaply made, on top of each other houses"
Expectation that a long term tenant (3-4 yrs) should hand over the house in exactly the same manner 4 years ago...
"pre-approval/application process with agents:

it is currently lengthy, varies greatly between agents and unclear on reasons for negative decision"
More protection for owners and landlords 
"window coverings should be compulsory, all properties should be energy efficient, a firm policy for maintaining properties that outlines all maintenance issues need to be resolved and not at the owners discretion because they don't want to spend any more money on the house. "
That houses rented out should be in safe clean condition.
"Compulsory lease renewal after a certain time.... We live in an area with very few rental properties. Our 12 month lease expired although we have continued to rent for several more years. However, NOTHING gets fixed and we are not in a position to force the matter because at the end of the day, if the owner doesn't want to spend money fixing things they will just ask us to leave and get new tenants in. There are so many people waiting for rentals to become available and a massive shortage of properties. "
Owners should be able to get the property back from the tenant by giving sufficient notice. Tenant should not be beneficial from 'not found a property to move' excuse if the owner give sufficient notice. I found our tenant is subletting the property and earning money but my hands are tight. current law allows tenants to do what ever they wanted to do but not the owner. 
"Have clearer expectations of what is ""fair wear and tear"""
"House inspected by an independent body to be deemed fit for renting. Issues like mold and large maintenance issues (roof leaks) should not be something a renter just has to deal with, while paying rent. "
Longer rental contracts

How long it takes for maintenance issues to be dealt with once reported 
As a senior renting it is very hard to pay $400 per week for somewhere decent to live. More affordable senior housing is just not available. 
Real estate companies have a better filing system as they have all ‘lost’ leasing agreements and other important documents which work in their favour when it comes to disputing anything.

obviously the cost which is the main drawback in striving to save a deposit for house purchase
Lower rent as most of the time we would be paying more then if we were paying off the house  to own our self and less frequent inspections.
no automatic rent increases every year
"Tenants to be treated with more respect, and treated as liars and cheats
for agents not to lie and cheat to make a buck"
Stricter rules for tenant rights
The communication between real estate agents and renters. I’ve had one company be absolutely awful with responding to queries and then essentially biting my head off for making assumptions because they hadn’t answered questions. 
Less inspections for long term renters.  Eg more than 5 years. Inspect annually 
Having to repair defective damaged items that were defective/damaged  at the start of the tenancy 
"A register of bad tenants that private land lords can have access to.
More help to retrieve owed money"
Easier for renting with dogs and more transparency when they don’t want it because there can be a lot of time wasting in the application process
"Stop Rental Bond Authority treating owners like Priories. We have invested a lot of money to buy an investment property, tenants have no respect for other people's properties and trash the house and then the Rental Bond Authority gives them their bond back because"" they couldn't afford to rent another property unless they get their bond""- what about us we are left with thousands of Dollars in repairs and the house is un-rentable for months!  "
Most families have pets this should not be an issue when finding a rental
"Cheaper rent, and having an off peak electricity meter installed without me having to pay $1000 to improve someone elses property :\ Last 2 places I've lived haven't had off peak meters, and I live alone, hardly use much electricity, yet my bill is between $400-$500 a quarter...."
That upon inspections rental agents take in consideration general wear and tear of living in houses and not expect places to be brand new when they are now not
Tighter regulations on real estate agents
"Making it easier to have a pet. Our landlord has said we can have a dog, but we are currently going through a process where we have applied with our body corporate to have a pet and they have said that people in the building have allergies and therefore we cant. We have spoken to everyone in the building (8 units) and noone has an allergy. "
More clarity and better communications from property managers.
"the Real estate is great, the owner won't do any maintenance but keeps on putting the rent up "
Have rental agents enforce the lease conditions for maintenance of rental properties.
"Have access to the property before moving in to check that it has been cleaned thoroughly 

The bond and 2 weeks notice is paid in advance up to 1 month prior to moving in but the keys are given on the day of entry leaving no room for the tenant to resolve any issues prior to moving in.

The bond from the previous rental property is not paid until all matters have been clarified and cleared up. This should be the same process when entering into a new rental agreement for the tenant to have all issues clarified and cleared up before moving in."

The on site manager is great - he struggles with the body Corp too"
Bond return hassles and delays. It should just be as easy as the rental agent ticks the box of full or half return then bang within 24 hrs the funds are deposited straight back in your account. Not weeks later and forms to fill out and mail in.
"Better training for, and engagement from, real estate agents. It is obvious renters are not a priority."
Less inspections for good tenants
"Security for renters. I was living in a rental property on the Sunshine Coast. I had been there 5 years and had someone turn up at my door one night with an eviction notice because the owner of the property hadn't been paying their home loan and the bank were repossessing the property. I had two months to leave the property even though I had just signed a lease renewal for another 12 months. I was told that if I didn't leave the property within the two months the locks would be changed. It was a very stressful time. After I left, I found out the property stood vacant for another two months before the bank auctioned it off.

Longer leases and more understanding about having pets. It’s hard to feel like it’s your home when you on know where you’ll be 12 months out 
"Tenants to actually feel head and valued, and not too feel robbed of general day to day rights. "
More time to inspect properties before applying
Change the balance of power landlords have over tenants in terms of grounds for giving notice to leave and rental increases every time a lease expires when the market doesn’t warrant an increase.
When the QCAT has granted orders against the tenant and the tenant defaults.  The owner is at more and more expense to follow up the issue.  The QCAT / Legal system needs much more power to pursuit debts owed by tenants.
Honest advertising around pets

I'd like to see more restriction placed on agents regarding the criteria they are able to assess and comment on during routine inspections.
"Sorry I have many! 
The excessive amount of money agents try to charge you for apparent damages that are really wearing tear. I believe this is to try and fix the property up at our cost.

The ability to enter however many times they feel like it if the property goes on the market with 48hours notice. 
The way you have to go through court to fight for your bond if they dispute anything whilst your bond is then tied up and you can’t get another home. 
The substandard entry reports agents do just so there is no evidence of an existing issue which they then blame you for.

Background rental history of Tenants
"Property managers - always rude and have a surperior look on renters. 

Property owners - they need to keep on top of the property maintence, such as leaking taps, paint chipping off walls and carpets at the end of there life span. "
Halt The standard rent increase that seems to occur at the end of a fixed term regardless of the lack of improvements or upkeep that occurs. A deterioration in the cleanliness of a premises when you move in- better checking of this.
After one year a tenant should be able to break a lease without penalty.
Fairness - if a landlord refuses to fix something and you are paying high rent it should be deducted. Also if the agency do not fulfill their obligations they should be accountable. There does not seem to be an option for long term rentors. 
"Having no excess fees on payment methods when you are given no other convenient choice. I have to use the DEFT payment system OR write a cheque or money order. Either way I will be paying a fee, another expense that adds up. "

"Greater transparency of advertisers about the standard rental rate, rather than them advertising a highly discounted rate for the small subset of people who are eligible for that government subsidised rate."
Flexibility to make changes and improvements in the house
Rent increase every year
"I think it would be to do with maintenance. I live in a housing house and there is so much that could improve the house and our lives. I was offered new floor covering through out the house, I said yes but couldn't get carpet in it. When I first moved into this house, over 20 years ago, I had to buy floor coverings so why cant they put what I want into the house. I paid a lot of money back then, and now housing wont do it for me except lino. "
"There needs to be a minimum standard for all homeowners who rent, If you tell me in the advertisement the house has all these features it needs to have them and the home needs to be maintained. The amount of times we follow up for repairs to be done is ridiculous not to mention inconvenient. Would you want people trapping through your home when your not around ??? "

"When the relationship between the owner and tenant is good due to both being good (owner and tenant). This keeps out the rental agent whom often puts divisions in between owner and tenant. No room for negotiation, and also issues are not passed on."
annual rental increases
"Have adjudicators apply standardised results and stop treating Lessors as fat cats making a profit. Cut the same slack for lessors as exist for tenants and apply the same standards. Even up the scales where the scales are weighed against lessors absorbing the risk and results, especially with a perpetually impecunious tenant not worth the cost of attempting to recover against. The presumption perpetually encountered by me as a lessor of two decades in the adjudication system is that of a presumption of power imbalance in my favour. I have many times absorbed massive loss and found myself without a fixed abode whilst paying mortgage on properties where no rent is received. The tenant is treated with sympathy, myself with cynicism and the outcome is almost always geared in favour of the tenant or to allow them leeway / concessions irrespective of evidence presented. The grounds of appeal are too limited, the adjudicator can act arbitrarily with nil review process thereby and can apply discretion based on their mood of the day. It’s an appalling process that is almost always unfair and unquantifiable. "
"Allow pets like in Germany. Stop having contracts 6 or 12 month. Would be easier if they were endless witth a certain notice period. Being allowed to make small alterations, like hanging up pictures, or installing curtains, etc."
"A little less power to the Rental Agents. While I agree owner's rights need to be protected, Rental Agents seem to think they are gods and demand way too much of the Renters.  There is no way as a renter you will complain too hard though because they will 'black mark' you just for disagreeing and there is nothing as a renter you can do about that.  The Black Mark system should either be abolished or tightly controlled so that Agents cant put marks against you just because they want to. You should have to earn a mark by something tangible like not paying rent. Being able to 'breach' someone is also way too easy and way too subjective. And there are no repercussions on the Agents.  There should be some sort of review where if an agent is black marking and breaching too much they should be investigated - because it would be clear at that point that there is either something wrong with the agent management, or that they are abusing the system for their own ego."

Place a strict Limit on rental price increases in dollar amounts and frequency
"Being a Pensioner it is hard as most Real Estates will not tell you but they don't like renting to Pensioners who live alone because of rent.  Even though it is guaranteed.   I have never not paid my rent,  Also Real Estates have the right to have too much personal Paperwork especially with all the IDENTITY THIEF AROUND.  Should be 1 Place set up for this information where the Real  Estates can check information is correct.  Staff change all the time and I am worried about Identity Thief. "
The ability to take more than four weeks' bond.
"More pet friendly rentals, with even a pet rental bond if necessary.
In Canada, where my wife comes from, almost ALL rentals are pet friendly, with some renters negotiating a pet bond. 
They accept the usual bond (2 weeks rent, not 4 !), as being sufficient for all conditions.
Water was always included, and sometimes electricity."
"The owner of my home owns more than 20 rental properties in my area alone.  He is clearly 'land banking' the properties and as such, is not in the least interested in maintaining them in a reasonable condition.  In fact, it benefits him in the long term if, when it comes time to develop the land, the properties are in such a state of disrepair (white ants, etc) that the heritage properties (as mine is) are no longer able to be saved and can be demolished without issue.  Therefore, he does as few repairs as possible and each time something goes wrong, it usually takes weeks of calls and emails to the Real Estate agent to get anything done.  As a result, I fix most of the small issues myself just to save the stress."
"Pets should be allowed for all renters according the states rules around how many.  You should be able to have a reasonable amount of holes in walls for photo frames etc and I think there should be something, at least for Queensland to have ceiling fans and security screens if requested by the tenant."
I think that having an inspection every 3 to 4 months is not necessary especially if the property is being kept clean and in good condition.
Rental agencies respect privacy of tenants better. 
Giving Landlords more authority/ownership of their property and to remove tenants with more ease. 
"We found it very difficult to rent with dogs - and then to allow the dogs inside. With risks such as cane toads and snakes (we're close to a greenbelt), this is an issue. While I understand the reasons why a lot of landlords dont like pets, perhaps an option could be to increase the bond should there be issues when the tennant leaves and/or putting in conditions (regular carpet cleaning and/or if damage due to pets is noticed during an inspection, this needs to be corrected asap)."
"Increase bond to allow for recover of rent when rentors exit. Now common for rentors not to pay rent and use bond to cover arrears. Does not leave any money to cover damage to house. Or increase exit notice time to 8 weeks so there is a chance to recover rent. 
This would also save rentors for being blacklisted."
"Reform on allowing pets in rentals.
Unmet maintenance issues."
No descrimination for pet owners if someone is hesitate in renting with pets they are entitiled to get references from 3 sources who know the people and how they look after their pets or at least their character reference geared towards their attitute towards pets and responsibility in general..
Ensure that there are a level of standards for both tenants and owners to adhere to
Limiting the amount of Property Inspections if the tenant is satisfactory throughout the first year of renting. I am always told that the place is in maculate condition however I feel a property inspection every 4 months is disruptive and over necessary. I also don't like that we are told not to hang anything on the walls or have furniture not tough walls. I have been at my rental for 3 years and I feel I am living in a museum with the rules I have to go by. It doesn't provide a comfortable living situation. 
No fees when paying rent
"options in paying rent. 

not just direct debit which is great for the real estate and owner, but adds extra cost to the tenant without any choice, which is extremely bad for a tenant with a limited fixed income."
Property managers and owners attitude toward their tenants
"Having more rights as tenants.
The current mindset of both owners and property managers is that the house is the owners “home” and tenants are just visitors and expected to leave the place untouched (to an impossible standard). When in reality, more and more people will be renting and may never be able to own a property. So a rental property may need to be considered a tenants “home” too. 
"
"Property managers should be less concerned about following the tenancy act, and more concerned about the needs of the tenants. At no point have the  Residential Tenancies Authority ever been of any help"
"repairs take a long time and i have to pay a weekly fee of $5 to pay rent that adds an extra $260 per year.  If there are concerns or to raise issues with the governing body, it normally takes a lot of effort or it has a cost."
"No inspection options outside their 10 min viewing is rediculous. I changed cities and was told by the agent to drive 250 km back the next day as a viewing was scheduled then- for an empty house, no tenant notice was needed. You get an old place and is expected to hand a new one back. An inspection happened 9 days after i handed the key back. Was told to send the cleaner back in because it was slightly dusty."
"The fact that the Renter is at the mercy of rental agents and landlords- that is, Renter choose your battles re what maintenance to request / what to make a (legitimate) complainant about / when to fight any battles because Renter can be kicked to the kerb at the end of any lease period at the landlords discretion"
The agent seems to think it is ok to break the rules so I would suggest a stronger control system when it comes to the situation where the agent simply does what they want
Owner driving past property and coming to property unannounced and real estate not doing anything about it
"I've had a couple agents try to take my deposit by not completing the initial inspection report properly popgun I would miss things they could then claim I had done. Luckily I took lots of photos and completed the report properly myself but it was obviously an attempt to defraud. Also, inspections are way too frequent and some agents have been too fussy demanding things like personal items be placed out of view"
"Making it easier to rent with pets, references, bonds maybe. But just because your situation dictates you rent shouldn't mean you can't have a normal family situation that includes pets."
"We were the first renters in a house that had been sold by the long time owner  only 2 months before our lease started.
There are many building etc issues that had been allowed to run down  by previous owner.
There should be an independent building etc report done at least when a house is first put up to rent.
"
Repairs fully completed
Properties to be inspected and faults rectified PRIOR to leasing out.
"Owners need to fix things before the situation gets out of hand and even dangerous, they need to look after their tenants and their property"
Allow higher bonds for lower rents / allow pet bonds
The level of power given to real estate agents.
Better enforcement of current regulations and applicable laws
The courts system be more timely
Have real estates and property managers advocate more for the tenant rather than make them feel like a second class citizen. 
Nothing really.  I've only been with one landlord and I have had no problems at all.
Ive been very rudely spoken to by Housing Manager
"Increase BOND from 4 weeks rent to 6 months rent.
You can hardly get anything fixed for 4 weeks bond anymore.
Anybody who thinks 4 weeks bond is enough should work 3 jobs for 20 years to enable them to purchase a rental house and then watch tenants treat the house with complete disrespect or worse and see how they feel then."
"Sometimes real estates/real estate agents can be a pain and can seem to not care about me. I would make them more compassionate. They do, after all, play a hand in whether I have a roof over my head at night. "
"If you are a long time tenant and there is no problems, to have a longer gap between inspections"
Making minor maintenance repairs without having to go through the channels and then not getting the repairs done. Rents are way overpriced for some areas which makes it hard for living. Should be able to do Bond transfers. Security screens should be made compulsory and not just fly screens. Fans and air conditioners should be serviced and sterilised before the next tenant. 
Ensure there is legislation in place to protect tenants from noisy neighbors where body corporate laws exist. 
Relaxing the rules of fair wear and tear and damage
Make contracts more binding on tenants and start a register of those that regularly break lease
"The communication between renter and landlord.
"
"Tenants and owners need to have their rights balanced properly.  Tenants currently have for too little responsibility when it comes to completing their lease.  I am a landlord and a property manager.  I am appalled by how easy it is for tenants to break their lease and leave with little or no penalty, and when we do try and get compensation for the landlord from QCAT the adjudicators almost always let the tenants off.  Tenants need to understand they are signing a legal agreement to rent the property, and they need to be held responsible for that lease until the end of the period.

There is also too much leniency regarding tenants who pay rent late or fail to pay rent.  Realistically if my tenant was to stop paying rent today, it might take me several months to get through QCAT, get an warrant of possession, organise the police to attend and remove the tenants from the property.  In this time the tenant can do significant damage to the property, and if the owner is relying on rent money to cover the mortgage they may end up in financial trouble themselves.  The Labor government needs to understand that not all landlords are rich, negative gearing people.  Some of us are just honest hardworking people trying to get our foot in the door of a very competitive property market, and just one bad tenant can destroy years of hard work and savings that it took to afford the property in the first place.

The RTA also needs to be more consistent with their answered.  Often when in disputes with tenants they claim to have received advice from the RTA which is inconsistent with advice I have received.  They also claim to have received advice that contradicts what is on the RTA website itself.

On the owners side, as a property manager I find many owners are poorly informed about, or flout their responsibilities as a landlord.  The often dont want to complete routine repairs and maintenance, or ask us to charge things to the tenant which we are not allowed to.  We also have trouble with landlords not wanted to have their smoke alarms maintained by professionals.  THIS SHOULD BE MANDATORY!!!  Landlords should be forced to have their smoke alarms maintained by a professional company, unless they are qualified to maintain it themselves.  If the government things they've solved this problem THEY ARE WRONG.  There are still many landlords who skirt the fire safety laws and it is just a matter of time before another horrific disaster comes in which many people may lose their lives.  Make professional smoke alarm maintenance a requirement for all landlords.

Overall I feel that the legislation is far too generalised.  There are many common issues which come up continuously with tenants and landlords.  The legislation needs to make it much more specific and lay out in explicit detail what the right and responsibilities of tenants and landlords are.  Renting as a lifestyle is not going away anytime soon, and unless QCAT is going to dramatically increase in size, then new legislation needs to leave less room for debate and interpretation."
For regulations to be more in favour of the owner
"The time to inspect the property properly so that one can determine all the fault in the property. Once the landlord had you signed on the dotted line, they do not bother to rectify broken or faulty stuff."
"If a realestate agent breaches their contract with the home owner eg if the contract says no pets and the agents signs the tenants in with a pet, the agent should be liable for all damage, inconvenience and loss of rent while new tenants are found and the contract with the tenant with a pet should be void."
Less inspections after 12 months on a lease
That all tenants be evaluated on their own merits from first applying.  Real Estates/Property Managers treat all prospective tenants in a manner that we are all the same and will not treat the property as needed and wont pay rent on time.  Also when you do your own bond clean - which is always cleaner that the professional bond cleaners - they always have to find something to call you back on and if you pay a bond cleaner they do not!  I have rented many properties over the years from many different real estates and this seems to be the case always.  Also maintenance needs to be addressed quicker than in most cases.  The excuse is usually 
Houses deteriorate due to wear and tear. Owners can't expect to receive their properties as there were before.
"ALL up front moneys MUST BE PAID in ADVANCE, so don't get behind at all."
"I have been very fortunate with my landlords, including appreciation of me as a tenant and this has enabled me to enjoy long-term tenure of my last 3 properties over the past 18 years. In some cases, it would be good to think that there would be more capacity and/or preparedness to spend money on some items."
More open communication with the RTA to liaise with tenants.  I am an Owner and I may as well let the Devil just take over the property.  I think there should be more transparency with who a tenant is and who they (the tenant)  thinks they are.  
"That when you go to court, the QCAT judge rules also at the same time that the overdue rent is placed against the tenant and not have to go back to court as we found a letter where the tenant owed $15,300 to SPER and left their belongings behind and went to jail for some criminal offences. We didn't apply to go back for the money and then when she comes out of jail and rings 7 months later wanting her clothes she left behind that were given to Vinnes and Lifeline after 3 months. She gets help to find accommodation and a truck to pick up a lounge and TV left behind and hadn't paid any rent or bond and said I didn't go to court to get the money from her. Owners should be told of a site we found www.auccr.com/free and tells more than the references they gave which were false about her paying the rent on time."
"Allow the tenant to feel more home in house and garden where personal items as pictures and posters can be put on to the walls. Allow to plant food like tomato and other edible in the garden. This could feel more home. I also don’t understand the intruding of real estate all 3 month and put there noses into our personal life and stuff. Its a breach of privacy. Never ever seen that in Europa, why here? It would be good to consider to change the law about big dogs on property generally. It makes no sense to have big dogs ( often aggressive) on small property’s. A big dog must have a purpose in life. Big dogs living on property’s mostly go never out are bored, destroy things around the house and reputation for everybody else that want to rent with pet dogs. Also are there a real treat for wild animals. Meddle and small dogs would be a better fit for small gardens and would it make much easier to rent a property while better repudiation will build up."
Make is easier for family to be able to change rental properties by transferring bond. 
Non-paper based entry and exit condition reports (as an option) to complete on iPad etc
"More flexibility to make your place feel like home. Able to hang pictures on hooks

Being able to give 4 weeks notice to terminate

Not being harassed 2 months out to see if you are re-signing or leaving "
Closer checks on tenants who get behind in their rent.
"Being able to make minor adjustments to the house/unit. For example in our last rental property, a unit, everyone could see into our apartment so we decided to put up a privacy screen. The screen didn't affect the unit structurally at all however one of the other residents complained about not wanting to see the privacy unit. We thought that was ridiculous, the privacy screen was on the inside of the unit as well so it didn't technically affect the exterior at all. "
to not have so many rent increases
"Make it much easier to apply, one register for the whole of Queensland so I don't need to fill out multiple, lengthy forms just to be considered for a property."
Having a competent rental manager
Direct communication with owner
Freedom to make you home your home... There is also pressure from investors to drive the rental price up
More pet friendly renting 
Cost of rent and the lack of response to things getting fixed
More flexibility with breaking a lease
"Longer lease security
Pets allowed as a standard
"
There needs to be better training for property management staff. The law is there to protect both owner and tenant however from my experiences the property manager attempted to cover my eyes as a tenant with wool in order to get a better/easier outcome for the owner. I feel for tenants who do not know their rights. 
"There are a few dodgy real estate agents out there- Your Future Property (Julio Lafayette) is one of them. Bad for tenant and landlord. 
There are some great real estate agents also - Hot Property- who look after both tenant and landlord.
"
"Better response times from agents. More feedback from agents after inspections. 
No restrictions on pets, especially for those like myself who have been renting for over ten years. 

More options to break lease safely with ample notice, with potentially having a ‘black mark’ against your name. 
More rental options like month to month, three months, six month contracts. "
Can be difficult dealing with body corporate issues when you have to involve landlord. 
less red tape as an owner
"The landlord has the right to sell property before lease expires, resulting in the tenant having to allow people to view the property whilst you are still living there."
I'd like to see improvements surrounding Rental agents. I do not believe that they can fairly represent the needs of the Tennant and the Owner and provide a neutral 'contact' I would also like to see some regulation introduced surrounding the increasing push from rental agencies to use 'their' recommended cleaning agencies to fulfil the requirements surrounding bond cleaning.
I would not have things like NAB Easy rent or rent payment services which charge for rent.
The rent prices have gone too high
Quicker response time to having things fixed and better notice for rental inspections.
"There needs to be much better communication from property managers regarding provision of basic tenancy documentation and repairs/maintenance. In my experience, owner managers are much better at this than real estate agents."
"When moving into a new house, tenants are to fill out a form for errors left by past tenants. I would like it if the tenants could fill out a form for errors with the agent so there is no confusion and nothing has been missed as we have had to cough up for errors that were not ours."
introduce minimum duty of care standards to better protect tenants from housing insecurity and unreasonable rent increases.
flexibility for renter after continuous 12 month lease with good history - option of month by month
"'- Requirement for Landlord's to perform regular maintenance on the property so that tenants are not left dealing with broken items or waiting on repairs for long periods of time.  We recently waited over 18 months for our fence to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm.  We also have pets so luckily my partner is a builder and could temporarily fix the fence so our pets didn't escape.  
- Understanding from Landlord's that good long term tenants treat their property as their own and therefore, they may want make the property feel like their home.  It would be great if Landlord's were open to asking long term tenants if there is anything they want in the property to make their living experience better.  We pay what I consider a premium rent for our property in Queensland and we have asked for an air-conditioner to be installed in our bedroom to make it more comfortable in the humid and hot summer months and our Landlord has refused but said we could pay for it? Not exactly fair when we have been there for 5 years."
Getting feedback from property management.
Respect for tenants as human beings 
"The renting laws need to be more inclusive to families and to pets, such as the recent changes to body corporate laws."
The cost of rent is much too high it should be capped 
"Establish a process so that tenants experience a more equitable, well-serviced, friendly and quicker experience renting.    "
Longer leases with fixed rental and landlords who kept their premises in sound condition.
Allow pets that are clean and looked after so there isn't so many homeless pets!
"The time limits required for certain actions eg landlord would like tenant to roll over lease for a further 12 month term or if they choose not to, then to vacate at the end of lease term. "
"That the Landlord has to repair items that are ticked as ‘clean, working & undamaged’ yet the agents do not inspect all parts of the property to see that what they have ticked is absolutely correct. Most agents are not qualified/knowledgable to do proper property inspections in all aspects of the property.  eg.  We had a hot plate that had three hot plates that did not work yet ticked as ‘all ok’ and it took 9 months to get it fixed because the agents did not want to know about the problem as well as in some cases the landlord does not want to spend the money to do the repairs BUT the tenant is still supposed to pay the full rent for all of the ‘items’ being in ‘working condition’. Also, when houses are cleaned, whether by tenants moving out or by bond cleaners, I have found the properties to still be VERY dirty."
cheaper rents for the age and condition of property 
"'- Inspections every 6 months instead of 3 months.
- Able to install blinds, curtains and hang frames. (make the house feel like home)
- not to be forced to enrol with third parts payment company and pay for their fees."
Reduce the number of regulatory requirements (Paperwork)
If homeowners became more aware of what they can and can’t enforce. That way we don’t have to point out to them when they’re doing something illegal.
Long term lease agreements 
"The time it takes to evict a bad tenant is way too long. By the time they are 8 days in arrears, then 7 days to remedy, then apply to QCAT, then wait maybe another 2 weeks. Not fair on the owners."
Owner lived next door and did not respect tenant privacy - property owners should be made aware of their obligations and restrictions to property maintenance and access to property - ie. tenant to be advised of when maintenance is planned on being undertaken
Property managers taking advantage of tenants
bring in a standard fee for break lease instead of having to pay it out in its entirety. similar to NSW. I recently had to pay out 8 months of rent because I needed to move.
To be able to hang photos and pictures 
"When vacating having to outsource the cleaning so that there is a receipt  that  says BOND clean which then 
costs $700 upward."
"The balance of power is wrong, it needs to be equal. Tenants may have rights but we can't act on them because it's the real estate/landlord that has all the power and I know of some people who have been unlawfully blacklisted. We are too afraid to ask for repairs to be done because we worry that they will think we are a problem tenant and kick us out or make life harder for us. Landlords can breach the contracts over and over without repercussion. If we breach we will be penalised. We can move into a filty house that has not been cleaned but when I move out, I will bet the real estate will keep my bond even though I had to clean after the previous tenants, wait for the landlord to put the chamber in my front door for 4 weeks before I could LOCK MY DOORS. We put up with repairs taking 18 months that aren't done properly and we say nothing. We have to be polite and suck up to people treating us like rubbish so we aren't evicted. Real estates can completely forget to send you a lease renewal (Currently my lease is 7 months late and like last time, I'm sure they will back date it) but then when they remember, I will have 14 days from the date of the renewal or I'll be evicted. Obviously there are bad tenants but there are also good tenants who go without hot water for long stretches because landlords don't want to pay. We have strangers walk through our house while we are at work, taking photos of our belongings even though it's illegal, they open our cupboards and invade our privacy and we have to accept it. I'm cool with inspections but to have privacy is something I pay for especially after being in a house for 5 years, it'd be nice if with good tenants they dropped inspections back to 6 monthly. They should know that I don't break things and not feel a need to look inside my wardrobe. No trust or respect from property managers or landlords no matter how well deserved. Renters are treated as second class citizens and that needs to change. Especially for those of us who move into run down properties that are not maintained by the owners and we do it ourselves giving up our time and money. I have no choice but to rent. My income is under the average income, wages don't go up with inflation and House prices are so ridiculously inflated now that I have no chance of owning any time soon so I rely on rich older people to have a home and put up with a lot from the real estate. I pay on time without fail and go above and beyond to care for the property as if it were my own. But still, we are treated like idiots because they know they can get away with failing to hold up their end of the contract because they know we are too scared to rock the boat and lose our homes."
"Ensuring tenants are required to pay for all damage caused by themselves, pets or others while leasing the property. Costs incurred for repairs to be paid outright and immediately, not over an extended period. If damage caused was found to be intentional a fine should also be imposed in addition to the repair costs.

Landlords should be required to complete maintenance and repairs of the property in a scheduled time frame. "
"Ability to have pets.  We have that now, but previous property was unmovable on the issue."
"Make it much harder for the many greedy and dishonest real estate firms to treat renters with contempt and disrespect.
It took three QCAT hearings before it was revealed L.J Hookers West Ashgrove had lied repeatedly and made false claims in order to seize a bond.
They were ordered to pay $178.
They never did.
And QCAT rulings apparently are not enforceable.
So the crooks suffer no consequences. Its not right and erodes our respect for the the rules and the law."
Removal of transaction fees and the way in which real estate agencies force payment via direct debit. Direct deposit should be an option as it doesn’t incur costs.
"I think the tenant should pay the 1 week finders fee to the rental agency and not the owner as per NZ.
This stops tenants rental hopping."
Service in terms of fixing things - I have been waiting 12 months for repairs to my apartment. I would also like to be able to have a pet. 
Increasing the amount of bond held by the RTA to 8 weeks.
Everything is geared towards the property owner's interests with very little care taken to protect the tenant or ensure the property is well maintained for the tenant to live in the property. I'd change the focus on maintenance and conditions to be about making the property livable and comfortable not just improving or protecting the owner's investment in the property.
Not being bullied and harassed by the owner and rental manager over minor things when there is no fire extinguishers or fire plans nor evacuation policy or safety issues for tenants and owners.
"A reduction in powers of the real estate to falsely claim cleaning expenses on exiting a property, particularly when the cleaning was of a professional standard."
"Better choices of rental properties and the ability to have pets, therapy pets"
"If there is a problem that arises in the house like a stove not working, that the agents place more importance on getting these fixed as quickly as possible.   "
"As a renter we would appreciate far better service from the agent that purports to be managing the property.
As a landlords we would like far stronger laws on controlling tenants and the ability to evict problem/destructive tenants."
For water usage to be the responsibility of tenants.
"Harsher penalties for tenants that don't pay rent and damage property.
More reasonable laws to remove tenants like above."
Keeping the tenants rent paid on time. 
I am a land lord of 12 yrs and have had a lot of ups and downes with tennants. We have had a number of tennants who have badly damaged our property and not paid rent. I have found that the QCat process is not responsive enough in these situations and have never had any success in getting people to pay for damage or rent arrears despite being ordered to
"RTA to not give tenants different advice each time you call, you never get the same answer."
Agents need to be educated more on their dealings with tenants - as a general rule they tend to treat renters as lower class citizens that they treat with contempt/disdain and they tend to view tenants as a money-making exercise when it comes to Entries / Repairs / Bond refunds.
"As a landlord, I always seem to be waiting to here from tenants re renewing their lease.  It would be good to have a mandatory timeframe prior to lease expiry to know if they are renewing or leaving."
"Changes I would like to update all the maintenance, such as wire light issues, and switch indoor and outdoor.  All house should have least hot water system and solar panels also least water tank in some form to support the household."
Make it mandatory for all inspections to have the owner present.
"Solar electrics to keep the cost down,
More secure housing locks on Windows and doors."
More strict rules on pets. I'm over barking dogs.
Stop bias to renters
"As a tenant, I would like to see house inspections only made mandatory when you end your lease. Currently, house inspections happen 3-4 months which is entirely unnecessary; It is a breach of privacy and a disruption of life. It can be determined fairly quickly how a tenant will treat and take care of the rental property. When trustworthiness has been established, then ongoing inspections are a waste of time and resources."
"More power for Property Managers when it comes to tenants damaging the property and rental arrears, we need to be able to protect the owner better. "
Should be able to kick out tenants who damage properties easier. 
Better training and regulation of letting agents.
Would like longer times between Inspections if you are a good tenant.
I would suggest that realestate agencies take more responsibility and pride in their work. Organisation seems to be a real issue as well as communication. 
Having renters that don't smoke and don't lie about it
"More tougher penities for breaches of the act.

Also  inspections every 3 months is too frequent. Once a year would be more appropriate and real estate agents to negotiate the time and date with tenants. "
"Tenant accountability for damage, breakages, and cleaning"
Ability to have solar / battery.
"Not allow pets in a rental property or have specific ""pet friendly"" and ""non pet friendly"" rental properties. In a unit complex, especially, having pets is unacceptable. Not all pet owners are responsible despite their claims. Dogs bark every time someone approaches a foyer near a door where the dog is locked up inside and they bark and cry every time they are left unattended. On multiple occasions the smell from cats and dogs has escaped from the 'responsible pet owners' apartment and flooded the common property and moved into other apartments, made worse when the pet owners go on holidays, locking their place up and not cleaning out the pets food bowls or removed their waste. Pets have also been seen defecating on common property (including lift and stair wells) and the pet owners have said its the responsibility of the body corporate to clean not themselves. No parent would say that about their childs mess. Unsightly animal fur is also often found clumped in common property areas. When issues as the above have been raised with the tenants, property owners, property managers, body corporate, its not the tenants that are pulled into line, its myself, i'm the one left victimised. Not all properties NEED to be ""pet friendly"" and tenants ABSOLUTELY 100% need to be held responsible for their pets and if someone complains about them it should be followed up properly and there needs to be recourse for the offending tenants and pets. Like smokers can't smell smoke on themselves, pet owners are oblivious to the smells of their pets and that smell lingers even after the pet is gone. Have some consideration for people that don't want to deal with 'the beautiful fur babies'

The process where a tenant asks permission before putting up picture hooks, shelves, wall mounting tvs etc works. There are very very few unreasonable property owners. Most just want the lines of communication left open, decisions and property respected, minimal issues and the rent to be paid so they can sleep at night without the repercussion fears and stresses. 

Vacating tenants dumping their unwanted belongings on the curb or in the confines of body corporate common property needs to be addressed by the RTA or local councils with enforceable fines issued to the offending tenants.

The property owners are the ones taking on all the risks, putting their health, relationships, lifestyle and future on the line when purchasing an investment property, respect isn't too much to ask for. Not all tenants want to be home owners, some people simply do not want to be responsible for the major maintenance/replacement costs of a property as things age (roof etc) Some tenants think only about today, property owners and investors have, by no other choice, to think about tomorrow, next month and the next 5 years"
If Maintenance was done in a timely msnner after beeing reported.
"Cheaper rent
Better landlords "
A sustainable increase in renting fees linked to wages growth.
A free database of all blacklisted tenants with reasons for being on it.
"To keep the owners happy, Agents often harass the tenants by making false and extensive claims on property damage. Normal tear and wear after a number of years is not clearly interpreted for them and this usually have caused problems for us and other friends who rent.

It seems that agents will look for any sign of 'change' in the property to say that this is a damage. Like tiles in the bathroom or kitchen cabinets will of course not be the same as the first day. They lose their shine and there might be small signs of tear and wear here and there. But the agents abuse their power, withheld the bonds and make the tenants pay for unnecessary renovations."
Mandatory pets allowed
"Stop with the house inspections ,,,invasion of privacy "
"Pets, like a single cat, should be allowed in more residences
also, the ability to hang pictures on walls"
I would not allow pets without permission of the owners 
"Lease terms and break lease rules

Feeling forced to sign another fixed term lease after initial lease ends. Constantly locked in a lease has seen me stuck in an unsuitable house for over 4 years, as rental properties are so few (and I have pets) nothing else suitable was available in the two week window we had to decide if we would re-sign each year (months before the existing lease even ended). 
Given the option to sign or move out left me feeling completely powerless. Repairs were never done in the house, but fear of upsetting the landlord and consequently risk them not giving a good review meant that we just had to put up with it. The fear of being left without a home will see you put up with a lot. 
Break lease rules are extremely biased towards protection of the owner, not the tenant. 
Tenants often barely have enough savings to move (with the extreme high cost of rent it is hard to save) in the case of a break lease not many people can afford to pay rent on two properties at the same time. There should be a limit on the amount of compensation a tenant should have to pay, maximum to two weeks rent. 
If a landlord breaks the lease they are not required to pay the tenants housing costs until they find a new place or until the end of the lease, this should be fair and equal both ways.
(When a previous landlord broke the lease on a property we were renting as they wanted to move in. We were not offered any compensation at all.) 

We were suffering health issues from the mould in the property, and eventually got out by applying for another house and taking it site unseen. We now find ourselves stuck again, moving in during winter, but the owners wanted to shift the end of lease to January. Noisy and quite scary neighbours have moved in behind us and we would like to move again, but it is near impossible to find a house (and very difficult on family) to move at this time of year. Again two months before our lease is due to expire we are now being given the ultimatum to re-sign or vacate on the lease end date.  
I suffer so much anxiety and depression due to this. 
Rent continues to increase and it's impossible to save for a deposit, renting in QLD just feels like being constantly trapped, trapped in a lease, trapped in the renting cycle. But with the worry of not having a home always lingering in the background if you rock the boat at all. "
"The experience you have with any given rental property is entirely dependent upon how good the real estate agent is at their job. I've had one wonderful experience, and otherwise mediocre or bad ones. I know people who have put in requests for maintenance and never heard back.

Also, I'd like to be able to put nails in the wall without having to go through a month-long process to hear back. It's a nail - you can fix it easily when you leave. Rental homes often don't feel like real homes because you can't even put art up, lots of the time. Most agents don't like you using temporary sticky wall hangers, either. In the States you can paint your rental home as long as you put it back to normal when you're done. I don't want anything that crazy, but I wish we could put up art and have a guaranteed response from real estate agents.

When we forget to pay our rent on the due date, I want to hear from the agent at the 4-day mark instead of at the 7-day mark because she's forgotten to message us, too. Renting feels unprotected and vulnerable."
make inspections 6 monthly instead of 3 monthly
Greater visibility by the Body Corporate of matters being considered and actions taken
"Tenants should be made to keep properties in the same state as when they moved in, not be allowed to put holes in walls, have pets without permission & they should have to maintain the gardens or risk eviction."
We had one situation where the real estate changed the price of the rental after another person offered to pay a higher price. 
"Owners take more responsability - I had now ensuite access for nearly three weeks, but paid full rent.  When I moved into the apartment, they did works for the first few weekends - they even cut up cupbards shelving my the lounge room (after I had cleaned it because it was dirty on move in) and had the door closed so my apartmetn was full of sawdust and I am allergic to dust - the owners then used my brand new vaccum to clean up the dust (while I was not home) and destoryed the vaccum cleaner.  Disgusting and I have no leg to stand on as they can simply not renew the lease if I make to much fuss."
More onsite manager for complex than the agents managing too many properties
Equal notice period for tenants to provide to landlords as per what landlords need to provide to tenants.
How easy it is for your bond to be taken off you. 
"The house we are living in is no where near the cost of rent we are paying. The landlord will not do any thing. The cost of renting else where is way to high. 
It is like the real estates and landlords have 90 % power the people who do rent have none if the prices go up any more there will be more people pushed out on the streets with no where to live."
Making it easier for people who end up in abusive situations to end a joint lease. 
"Application process is time-consuming and not being able to seek feedback regarding why you were not selected is disheartening. Selection criteria is tighter and prices are raised because the demand is high, makes it difficult.

Be able to hang up paintings/photos."
Remove realestate agents from the process 
"Speedier communication with property managers. After completing one lease, always having the option to go onto periodic lease"
"L/Lords not fulfilling obligations (premises should be in a good repair)

Fees charged on top of rent payments by 3rd party schemes"
Less property inspections. If a house is being well kept then you should go from 3 monthly to 6 monthly property inspections. 
How quickly the owner responds to issues. 
Same notices periods to end a tenancy for both parties
Dealing with difficult landlords who repeatedly refuse to do repairs.
"the current rules and terms are very much written by the tenants, with little interest in renters except taking their money"
increase bond for lessors security as QCAT process is so slow to implement your claim .
A proper mediation service when issues between tenants and property managers/owners arise. More accessible information about tent ants rights and how to get help. 
Big name Real Estate's trying to make your life hell when you leave a property band not wanting to give bond back despite there being no issues. 
"Be able to write a lease with optional   years on it eg say 1yr lease with options for 1,2 or 3 years."
Tenants who damage properties should be held accountable for the damage
Make it easier for maintenance to be completed somehow.  There are too many owners who are happy to take the rents in one hand without doing maintenance.
"Improve the balance of power between renter and rental agent and owner. Rental arrangements should be treated as other transactions where there is a willing seller and willing buyer for a service. Where a renter is paying their rent and generally looking after the property as if they owned the property then the renter should be treated with the same respect that customers for other goods and services are treated. Instead tenants are treated like some good-for-nothing low life that must be constantly scrutinised, supervised and punished for the slightest signs that the property has been lived in. Having rented for the past 10 years I have been harassed and humiliated by agents who have stood around watching me while I was made to scrub out garbage bins, and repaint entire walls because of one tiny repositionable plastic hook that I put up."
Making it easier to fill out the application forms 
Not for real estate agents to be tough on tenants when having house inspections.
"Encouraging owners to be more open to flexible (PAYG) lease agreements
"
Have bond money transferable once your lease is finished and new one is found
more updated regulations on real-estate businesses 
Being able to have pets. I'm happy to take responsibility of any damage my dog makes to someones property.
More affordable housing for singles and pet owners.
At the moment nothing our managing agents are thoroughly professional and make this seamless for us.
"Pest Control the responsibility of property owner.
Faster turn around times for major repairs.
Full house should have working refrigerated A/C units in Northwest QLD and be taking as a high priority job when repairs are required. In SA due to the cold weather it is the property owners responsibility to provide heating for their rental properties."
The speed of bond release
"Getting rental agencies to open on a Saturday.  From a tenant's perspective, viewing days for houses are usually during a working day and it is difficult to get constant  time off work to look at properties especially when you have to travel out of the office in the city to the suburbs to look at a house. It also makes communication difficult and the wait to hear if an application has been accepted or even been processed can be a long time. "
Honesty/Disclosure when the landlord is selling. This especially when tenants are looking for a place to rent.
Living situation security for long term renters
A break lease fee
Access to property maintenance as required rather than as landlord see fit.
"When we need some thing to fix, manager should act quickly to organize and solve problems as soon as possible for owner and tenant."
"Real estates more accountable when the rental gets changed half way through the lease.
"
Longer rental periods than 1 year to give more security to both parties
"Provide offers for renal properties. Just like an auction, highest bidder or best offer can secure the property"
I believe too much power is given to tenants - owners have to often pay for things they may not be able to afford.  Bond does not cover a lot of the damage. 
Longer term agreement to rent to guard against owner selling property early.
"More disclosure from Agent or Owner with regards to the prior and current use of the property.  In my case i was not informed of the fact that the other half of the Duplex i rented is a Church of Scientology Auditing and detox centre. And as such there are people from all countries living here for at least 3 months at a time while they get their ""treatment"" "
Real Estate Agents having more accountability as Property Managers.  It is too easy for them to absolve themselves of blame if they have been negligent in their duties. 
"Tenants to be treated with more respect and dignity, particularly when properties are in high demand."
Tenants should need to give 4 weeks notice of intention to vacate
"Have rented homes taken off internet, so I don't apply for homes that have already been rented."
Not being forced to allow a tenant to live in my house for months without paying a cent in rent before anything could be done
Have a complaints process that is not as severe as RTA but can manage incorrect procedures from property managers
"New to investment property ownership, too inexperienced to comment on this question. "
That any repair requests (within reason obviously) be approved.....seems alot of owners of rental properties don't like to do spend their $$ yet we as tenants are expected to treat the place like we are the ones that own it.  Bit of double standards
"Landlords to treat us as equal human beings, not just as their money tree, and to consider the living conditions we have to put up with, and to question themselves as to whether they would live in such conditions."
Spot check on property managers practices to ensure they are not breaching privacy laws or misusing information given. 
"more realistic rents, with less  greed. Rents should not be increased every year."
I believe some general wear and tear is not it is damage and tenant should repair. Eg when tenant damaged wash cabinet with water because they did not connote hose to tape correctly and over time small drips damaged cabinet. Real estate who managed call it wear and tear.
"Tougher penalties for Real Estates failing to complete maintenance. I currently have a hole still in my back deck that has been there since I moved in 12 months ago. We were informed it would be fixed before we moved in. It never was. I had cupboard doors and other door handles fall off, that still have not been seen to! It is ridiculous."
"Be able to terminate and black list bad defaulting tenants immediately to minimise lost  to owners and prevent other innocent landlord accepting bad tenants unknowingly. At the moment, it is a long tedious process of issuing breaches and applying to QCAT and final eviction of nasty tenants."
"That the contact between agents, home owners and tenants is better organised, at the moment I feel it's more about them then the tenants, had some horrible experiences with agents, having a different one every 3 months and with some  owners it's clearly about the money and don't want to spend to upgrade or replace certain items.
I had an oven once that wasn't working and had to wait 6 months to get it fixed, that's bad."
I don't like the rent increasing every time a new lease is signed. I think it should remain the same if nothing has been done to improve the property or renting experience.
"How much the rent is. It can be raised unfairly. I think there should be a cap on how much rent is increased by. I earn about 700 pw and my rent is almost 400. I live in an old fibro 2 bedroom house with no air conditioning or sealed garage. After my rent, car payment, car insurance, fuel (I use my car for work all day) etc, there is not a heck of a lot left in fact sometimes i overdraw and have to wait until next pay day which is generally two weeks away. "
being treated like a trustworthy person
"Property Managers need more experience managing properties, understanding the Tenancy Act and what is the responsibility of the owner/Property Manager/tenant. It is too easy complete a Certificate IV, become a PM and then not understand the role, duties, Act and expectations."
Communication from the real estate and transperancy in regards to bond refunds 
"There is a pervading judgement on those who rent.  For property managers, they regard that they are agents for the owners and that those renting are an interchangeable market commodity.  Renters are people, families, individuals, business people, community members, and as such, deserve respect and consideration while they create a home in the property they are occupying for a fee.  For successful property management, the relationships with occupants are just as important as the relationships with property owners."
Affordability and availability of rental properties for families 
"Less inspections, more responsive owners
We find the photographing of our residence , on a 3 monthly basis, quite intrusive."
The entire RTA Bond and QCAT is ineffectual and frustrating when a dispute of claim is required.
"Real estate agents misleading tenants, being abusive and dismissive toward tenants, intimidating tenants and generally being unethical and unreasonable."
"Being able to charge tenants for full water use and have them receive the bills, just like power and gas."
"Animals, I am so sick of places not being Pet friendly. This is WHY there are overflowing pounds and rescue groups etc cause people just dump their animals in fear of being homeless.
I have chosen  to be homeless when I could not find a house that would take my dogs too, they are family. Would it be legal to say ""NO KIDS""? Cause kids cause way more damage than animals do.
This is such a huge issue all over Australia, Landlords should NOT be able to discriminate whether a place has animals or not. 
Do a Pet rental Bond if needed on top of the normal bond of an extra $500 per pet or something like that. But this law needs to change."
"Tenants should be more accountable for malicious damage to properties
There are no effective remedies when a tenant leaves a property with large amounts of damage and arrears
Bonds are insufficient and databases recording such behaviour are onerous and fraught with risk for those recording information"
An easier process for a 3rd party to review before and after condition reports. A breakdown of what constitutes normal wear and tear versus tenant damage
Declaration of conflict of interest if Rental Agency is also the owner of the property. 
More opportunity to clean my house and have inspections. 
I think that all properties should allow pets 
"Privacy. I believe that entry notices are the most intrusive form that a renter has to deal with. No one would feel good about someone you don't know having access to property at any time due to a entry notice.

I renter and also a landlord. I would never use this form without good cause. Agreement with the renter should alaays be asked for. "
Lease continuance certainty.
"Being allowed a pet in a pet friendly building. Privacy blinds now that new apartments have been built since moving in. 
Be able to hang picture frames on walls."
"I once lived in a house that was damaged to the point of being dangerous. Complaints to the real estate agent did not help, as the owner did not answer real estate phone calls. As a result badly needed repairs were not completed in a timely fashion, if at all.
I believe that in this scenario, the real estate agent should be able to have repairs completed and be compensated by withholding rent. Obviously, there would need to be minimum standards implemented regarding attempts to contact the owner, etc."
Less fees on the property managment side 
Less inspections for tennants who have good reports repeatedly in 5 years 20 inspections with no issues.  
Make more properties pet friendly
Agents/owners should be able to carry out inspections without notice if problems are made aware to them. 
Change the shower head in the main bathroom 
Lower the booking fees
property managers being more attentive to the needs of the tenant and not just to the needs of the owner. i.e. Responding to requests and communication in a timely manner.
"Would like to see property managers be qualified to understand things such as septic tanks, grease traps, and other systems in homes."
"Everything in the rules is in the property owner's favour. Here is one suggestion for change: tenants need to give 1 month notice to owner before leaving, tenants are not  liable for remaining rent to end of contract. The current rules chain the tenant to the property - this is feudalism. "
Break fees are not fair.
Allow renters the choice to keep a small pet in houses or large units.
For tenants to really after the property and abide by the tenancy regulations 
Being able to put up pictures and safely secure things to walls
"Properties repaired and as necessary upgraded as one would with their own home. This could, in some instances be done by tenants, for example painting, giving them some sense of ownership and pride in their property. The owner of the property would pay for the products required as they would for their own home which would improve the value. I'm thinking here of long term tenants. The property is often left to decline, with the bare minimum emergency repairs carried out,  until tenants move out. It is then spruced up to take to market either to sell or re-rent, with an air conditioner added or kitchen updated as is needed to compete in the current market. The long term tenants have in effect been penalised rather than rewarded for the regular income they have provided the owner. It could be the job of the agent to advise the owner of improvements that could be made and so work fairly between the owner and the tenant as apposed to the rudimentary inspections currently carried out to just tick the box for the owner and continue to receive their commission."
To have some power and authority instead of being at the mercy of the real estate agent. It's their word against yours and they know all the ins and outs so you have no chance.
Real Estates have too much power - they follow the rules when it suits them. Great regulation on Real Estates and changing the laws to provide more power to the people would go a long way to fixing the situation.
The way real estate agents process payments.
"Rather than simply increasing the rental amount in line with comparable properties in the area, landlords should also be made to ensure the property and the appliances inside are kept up to refreshed and replaced periodically so that a renter isn’t paying an exorbitant amount for a tired and inefficient property."
Have more onus on the realestate to do their jobs better. If a real estate has been complained about too many times then they need to be blacklisted and investigated. Why put other renters through hell if they've already done in to 50+ more?
"We have a faulty smoke alarm & if the contractor the rental agent sends find no fault I have no recourse to get another contractor to inspect the unit. As they are using the same contractor who passed the unit previously, that contractor may not be reliable. When I asked the agent if another contractor could be used they refused & said I couldn't get one in myself.  I would like the option to have an independent contractor

If the contractor says there isn't a fault I'll be changed for the callout & will be stuck with an unsafe, unreliable unit."
Rental has not increased in 5 years and rents are inadequate.
People shoud not have to indicate the source of their income or how many children they have. 
Acess to hours services
Tenants to be held MORE accountable for damage they make during tenancy and quicker action allowed when rental payments default and easier ability to end a tenancy when people don’t pay or cause too much damage or disharmony in the neighborhood. TENANTS NEED LESS RIGHTS. 
"After renting the same property for over 10 years I would like to have either annual or at least biannual inspections, rather than every 3 months. "
discrimination against pet owners and also landlords should have to get written permission to do inspections and if they don't inspect property at any time all for a period of more than 12 months then the landlord should not be able to prosecute tenant for wear and tear to property if no inspections have ever been made
Being allowed a pet in a pet approved building (approved by body corporate but not by owner).  
Easier way to transfer bond from one rental property to the next when moving 
"It's too jard to get infinite renting, they always want limited contracts, 6 or 12 month and then increase rent when renewing. I would like that to stop"
Apply penalties to managers/property owners where overpaid rent was far too long (2 Months) in being refunded.
Balanced rights between landlord and rentee
The NBN should be connected to every household and the realestate or owner should ensure that it is connected. 
"Legislation more fair to both parties, RTA advice neutral not on the tenant side. "
More supportive real estate at times of entry/exit of property for tenants.
Streamline the application and approval process.
To be able to ask for maintenance without rent increases. 
Improve tenants security of tenure.
"* real estate inspections - to respect tenant's wishes if they wish to be present at the time so if the tenant isn't available to negotiate a time (off course within a reasonable timeframe so the inspection does go ahead). It's invasion of privacy and have some instances of real estate agents going through private contents in the house
* real estate giving keys to tradesman for repairs - again walked in one day on an electrician, didn't know someone was going to be there for repairs and electrician had turned the air con on and the tv. That's not appropriate and again privacy issues.
* repairs should be completed on time not waiting for months 
"
Time frames for giving notice to vacate a property need to be even for an owner and a tenant.
"Give renters more rights, currently it is near impossible to get an agent that will listen to your issues and help with any maintenance issues. And there is nowhere to take these issues higher."
Legislation to be clearer. Implementation of a Pet Bond to encourage more Landlords to feel comfortable approving pets. 
Property managers that know how to do their job
Ensure that everything is in working order before taking posession.
Property managers acting like they own you because you rent from them.
The rental agency and owner must be more accountable and more responsive to repairs required. They take their own time and don’t care. Issuing a Breach of Tenacy has no impact. 
"STOP PUTTING UP THE RENT! OUR WAGES DON'T GO UP, AND I FOREVER TRYING TO BALANCE MY MONEY,  ALONG WITH A CAR LOAN, AND PERSONAL LOAN.  "
"There needs to be a balance between tenant's rights and owner's rights. Everything is in the tenants favour and the lack of penalties for tenants now ensures that if they do the wrong thing, there is not deterrent in place to ensure they maintain the property and pay the rent on the time."
have owner maintain the property-very little money has been spent over last 10 years
Laws in favour of the agent
"A fair system for owners and tenants, particularly when a tenant vacates with damage or outstanding rent. To ensure the landlords can claim this back without having to jump through burning hoops. "
"We as property owners, look after our tenants and allow them to treat the property as their own.  Unfortunately tenants do not give us the same respect, and many times the properties have been left needing a new renovation.  I;m not sure how you would change this.  "
"Change the rules so tenants are responsible for all utilities - water, sewage and access charges should all be passed on the the consumer."
Rental application process less daunting and invasive
The standard of furnishings and white goods when renting a furnished property 
"Condition reports filled in by both tenant and agent at the same time as part of the sign up, with photos and recordings."
Make legislation more defined. There are many grey areas and open to interpretation.
"Faster access to QCAT hearing
"
More tools in favour of the managing agent 
Notice periods for vacating are very much in tenants favour and should be more balanced.  2 months notice is required from a landlord but tenants can give 2 weeks notice.  These time-frames should be more even.  Obviously 2 weeks' is not enough time for a tenant to secure another rental so perhaps 30 days notice from either party would be more fair.
Better security-cheaper rent
Landlords that maintain rental properties in a timely manner.
"Renters need to take care of the property more ""like it is theirs"" rather than just abuse everything and ask for it to be fixed when it breaks"
"Tenants to have more flexibility/more say in making the dwelling ""their home""
Eg. Putting in a garden,  putting pictures up on the wall, installing flyscreens or air conditioners. "
Being able to put pictures in the walls 
"Not being so particular about tiny marks on the walls or carpet, and allowing pets."
"Communication between owners, real estates and tenants. More often than not everyone is on wrong pages."
That the owners fix repairs Quick. That the don't even repair a broken kitchen cupboard door for near 12 mths and deem it non essential for nearly a year.
Make the inspections less frequent than 3 months. Have the right to change the locks and not have to supply a set to the agent/owner until vacating
Being told to ‘bond clean’ on departure and then moving into dirty apartments. I have had to clean every apartment I’ve moved into but they should be clean. 
Lower renting so I can save for a home loan deposit 
Agents need to treat tenants with more respect. As a divorced woman over 50 with a good income I have often been treated like a loser because I rent. Need longer leases and longer inspection times . 10 mins is not long enough when considering you may want to stay for 3 years or more
"Be able and allowed to contact the owner / landlord of the property I rent, the real estate does a terrible job at managing the property of where I live (appartments/lodge)"
Allow for pets on property 
Maintenance and up keep of property by the landlord/agent
Communication from the real estate
"Having been a home owner and now renting, they way you are treated as a ""renter"" is just an unpleasant feeling, you really do feel like the second class citizen aspect.  Usually fee a little intimidated with dealing with Property Manager if wanting to state there are things that are required to be dealt with with the property.  we look after the property we have as if our own and spend a lot of time and money maintaining more like a hoeowner than a ""renter""."
"Rights are unfairly and unfavorably weighted in favor of tenants - Tenant get 2 weeks notice to leave vs Landlords have to provide 2 months notice to leave.
There are way too many forms. Staff at QCAT openly make decisions in favour of tenants in contradiction of the law. They openly champion appauling tenants that don't pay rent, damage property and leave a disaster area in their wake.
Get rid of QCAT - disputes should be settled in Courts, not by untrained wannabes."
Better education given to landlords and tenants regarding expectations of responsibilities.
A bit more onus on the lease to care for the yard - as in keeping it maintained.
Pets allowed automatically. I'd be fine with landlords putting clauses in to say that any damage will be the tenants expense etc but all I want is pet friendly and not limits on the size eg under 10 kg. My dog is 30 kgs but sleeps all day and doesn't make a sound. 
I would not allow property managers or their appointed representatives to take photos of the renter's home furnishings and inside their toilet when there is clearly no damage done to the property. This happened to me and it was a huge invasion of privacy not to mention a shock that they took photos and sent them to the landlord and not one photo had any property damage visible. 
Inspections every 3 months is excessive.
"that there is the option of living in a smoke free environment - the slack smoking laws mean that people can smoke just about anywhere, including balconies with the smoke wafting into our apartment 24/7"
"Rental  managers are dishonest and do not work for the tenant, however work for the landlord no matter what, as it is business. Rental managers are more than willing to lie to save them and their landlords money. its all about money.  rental managers are not honest people"
If the repairs required urgently were conducted. 
More flexibility around housing pets. Example: allowing small animals inside.
"Qcat 
Procedure to receive your bond back when owner has false claims...i had to be the applicant and pay court fees to have my money released."
Insurance rates for body corporates
Landlords and owners being open to renting long term to single families. With four kids and being a single mother on a disability pension for a chronic genetic illness I was born with I can’t move every 12mths or 24mths. The cost of removalists alone last time we moved one suburb away was $780. We were quoted $450. Then to even save for Bond and rent is actually impossible when on benefits. But my income is stable and I think it’s a valid form of income and yet I’m penalised for being a family. I keep my home neat and tidy yet I’ve had to move four times in 5 years and I’ve applied to over 36 properties and wasn’t able to find a home which makes you feel so hopeless knowing you maybe homeless with your children. I’ve never applied for public housing because I think I can budget and afford renting in the public sector . However it’s getting harder and harder as I get older to find an agent or landlord who will rent to a single mum on a disability pension . 
"As a tenant and a property manager, there should be a mandatory time frame for owners to complete repairs and maintenance to a property."
"Unsure, but I'm also looking at this from a landlord's viewpoint.  I've been fortunate to have good tenants so far."
The ability to sign a lease for more than 1 year at a tme
Not having landlords/tradesmen/renal agents entering my home without me being there.  Pre arranged and agreed upon entrance times.  At the moment Agents/landlord dictate entry times for inspections and tradesmen to enter with an agents key while I am not home.  This is a blatant disrespect of my families home and our security.   Its downright disgusting  someone can enter my house just by giving me 24 hours notice.     I work and then have to ask for time off or go sick to be there when agents or tradesmen enter my home.
solar power for renters... we are missing out
"make all landlords and rental Agencies to do all  repairs to their properties, in a timely manner"
"I'd like some direct contact between myself and the owner.  I'm not happy with the real estate that is handling my property, I don't necessarily want to go to the RTA or cause problems but I would like to be able to consult with the owner's themselves."
"Allowing pets - Cleaning up after them would of course be the owner's responsibility. 
Faster repairs/answers - My experience has been fantastic so far, but many of my renting friends have waited upwards of 6 months to have dire repairs attended to. It seems to be the luck of the draw where landlords/real estate agents are concerned
Parking - At my current place of lease their is 1 car space for a 3 bedroom unit. Luckily between the 3 of us we only have 1 car, but my visitors are told to leave if they park in the visitor car space for too long (in one instance my dad was staying for a hospital visit (only 2 days) and was threatened to move his car or they would tow it) and many of my friends have to pay fortnightly just to park their car at their own home. I have put off buying a car because I would also have to pay frequently to park on the street. 

  "
Less government interference in the process.
Tightening up the leniency around evicting tenants who stop paying rent - they are abusing the system because they know they can.
decrease frequency of inspection time allowances. three monthly inspections make your home feel like it's not your home. daily viewings from prospective tenants at the end of a tenancy is very irritating but almost impossible to prevent.
Easier to rent with dogs.  
"Cheaper rent for signing a longer contract (e.g., 12 or 24 months)"
Make the rental bond return conditions more clearly defined. 
"Change the (2) months notice period that owners/property managers must give tenants to vacate properties, back to (2) weeks.
The same amount of time that tenants give landlords when they are vacating.....

The extended period makes property management difficult.
"
Benifits to long time renters
"Relaxed home inspection 
Pet friendly "
"Inspections for long term tenants should be extended between visits after living in properties, with no issues, after say 3 years. "
"It would be good to have better tax rebates and other supports available to landlords to make affordable housing more user-friendly; things such as universal design, sound insulation and energy efficiency, including PV and passive solar design so that tenants can lead more productive lives and contribute better to the economy and the future and properties are in a better capital gains situation on sale. Retirement villages have deferred management fees, why not rental properties with government fees and charges?"
"How when leaving a house you must have a professional cleaner receipt, carpet cleaners, flea spray(even if you don't have a pet)"
"Exit Report.. after following all rules, cleaning, having 3 months inspections, telling real estate problems with the property time after time then when you leave the property you get blamed for things that you have reported so they want to take it out of your bond"
Notice period needs to be the seme for owner and tennant and they can agree upon it in their contracr eg. Tennant can give a months notice so can the Landlord. 
The power imbalance between owner/property management and tenant.  Tenant's are treated as a totally replaceable commodity.  There is no point being a good tenant or staying in a property long term.  You are treated the same as any other tenant.  It is a business relationship and should be treated as such.  Not as though you are a mass produced homogenus product.
"Nothing, my landlord was respectful, made necessary repairs in a timely manner. When we originally moved in they let us pay off the bond.  The rent was a reasonable price.  We in turn looked after the property as we would our own home and it was returned to the owner at the end of the lease in better condition than when we moved in.  It was clean, the carpets had been professionally cleaned. There was reasonable wear and tear but nothing drastic or unexpected."
The way lessors can enter and dictate non-permenant aspects of how you use the property
The ability to talk to real estate instead of only being able to communicate through emails.
Giving renters more rights
House owners need to fix things quicker then what they are. Still been waiting 4 weeks for our dishwasher to be looked at
"Owners of the property should be involved in the emails and maintenance requests. Too much is neglected by real estates, making it worse for the owners. 
Should also be audits done on real estates, they try some seriously illegal stuff and bully tenants around with uncalled for threats."
Garden maintaince bond
The attitude of some more junior property manager employees who seem to treat renters almost as criminals.
That real estate agencies not be allowed to raise rents every year.
Tenants need to learn responsibility
"Living in Queensland,a dwelling should have a/c or at least ceiling fans.its 2019 for god sake ."
Avenues for renting for people without a rental history with references.
Having people who respect the roof over their head...& care for the property & maintain the state it was provided...eg gardens
"Appreciate and value a good tenant that goes above and beyond, to maintain the property at a high standard. By not increasing rent continuously. Keep rent prices affordable. I don't think it is necessary to take photos of all the tenants belongings at an inspection. Photos should only be taken if there is damage done to the property or maintenance that needs to be done. "
More homes need to be pet friendly
"Applying for a property to rent, is very hard even with a good renting record. Real estates make you feel like a second class citizen. "
"Six monthly inspection instead of three, privacy is a big issue for me"
I have the best Landlord  I’m not needing any changes 
"Better protection from criminals renting in the same complex , better laws to protect non smokers against neighbours who smoke , less fees, more choices with providers for utilities, laws to force real estates and home owners to fix things that are broken, "
"I would like for my inspections to be less frequent after I have had a few and proved that I am looking after the property.

I would like to be able to be able to have a pet dog but am not allowed."
"Long term leases so you actually have a home and in return are prepared to add value to the property by creating gardens, painting and maintaining "
Any damages done should be fully paid by tenants or increased bond.
"Make the Rental Agents more responsible for their inspections. 
"
Make documents simpler to understand
Ability to customise my space. 
"Stereotype of a cranky Property Manger who had perhaps just dealt with a rude renter 
and approaches me with an aggressive and abrupt attitude.

"
Allow pets in rentals it is a human and animal rights issue.
Lack of clarity from building management around certain rules and procedures e.g. booking extra car parks for residents. Front office staff all had different positions regarding what was and wasn’t allowed. This was very frustrating when entering into a 12 month lease with the understanding that we had secure car parking options for at least 1 night a week. We followed the booking rules when others didn’t. Then the booking procedures and parking allowances for residents were changed without notice. It seemed to be a case of developing policy on the run and not applying it equally. Access to some additional parking was a significant criteria for choosing the apartment and agreeing to a 12 month lease in the first place.
"Less intrusive routine inspections, I should be allowed to be in the house"
The entire real estate system. 
I would stop the ability of real estate agents to photograph tenants belongings and inside of houses without a tenants approval or without a need -a particular problem to show someone. i.e real estates photographing the house every time they inspect and photographing children's room and private areas even though there are no problems or concerns to be addressed 
More affordable properties for rental
"I have found rental properties to be woefully cleaned which meant, during the stressful time of moving in, I had to do extensive cleaning to make them stisfactory for habitation. I'm an aged pensioner, 70 years old, and it is unfair for previos tenants to get off scott free having vacted with minimal cleaning. Property agents have not enforced the exit cleaning. CLEANING NEEDS ENFORCING BY AGENTS."
Have clearer rules regarding property management expectations for property vacate check lists so there can be no ambiguity surrounding house standards. 
More open communiction with agents
"Being able to contact the owner if no help from property manager. But only as a last resort. As had a manger try to blame the owner saying they couldn’t get hold of them or they hadn’t responded. But in the past everything was always fixed. Found out she wasn’t doing her job properly. The way I found out was the pest spray guy came and did his job, and he was friends with the owner, so he told them what was going on. They knew nothing about it."
Real Estates response to maintenance requests.
Better transparancy with tenants and mandatory insurance for renters similar to car insurance. 
"The real estate take the responsibility when things need repair at the property, and get them done in a timely manner.
When vacating the property the real estate should do there paperwork in a timely manner, make sure they use the proper condition report, dont accuse the tenant of things after timelines haven't been met on there part"
"The insistive interpretation from some landlords to do inspections quarterly, continually. The rules should be changed to: first rental period.. quarterly, but after this, an extending/continued lease period will follow with 6 monthly inspections as a rule even for a 6 monthly lease and especialy for annual agreements. Another change could would be force private landlords to renew leases at their own office or through internet email or other, instead of making this another possible kind of halfbaked inspection privacy Intrusion. And when it comes to properties with a garden, that  landlords can't insist that they wish to maintain the garden themselves because of cost of  a independent gardening service, if tenants can't manage it by them self. It's just feels like another privacy Intrusion that can exalate into how many times the garden needs maintaining a year.  With more and more people options to rent than buy these days, it's imperative that these rules of engagement gets ironed out clearly not making gaps for leaving tenants secondary citizens always mistrusted no matter their exilent references from previous landlords. The problem is really some private landlords reluctancy to trust in any tenants these days because of stories heard in the media's , it now seems to become a serious issue for trustworthy tenants."
"As an owner, the system is skewed. We have to do urgent tasks (which I appreciate make for a livable house) however, they can string out non-payment, only have to give 2 weeks notice. We work hard to keep our tenants happy but there must be balance. "
That if owners are in trouble financially there is a way for renters to recoup the cost of having to move because the property is foreclosed by the financial institution. Owners should have to show they are not in financial difficulty similar to renters having to prove they can pay the rent. 
I have rented but have also been a home owner and rented this property later as a landlord. There needs to be more open disclosure re prospective tenants. The laws are changing to the benefit of the renter and reducing owners rights. The owner should have the final say who rents and if there are pets etc. The changing cultural face of QLD also means some renters have unrealistic expectations of their responsibilities in maintaining the house 
"Agents. Few are interested in the lessor or the tenant, they generally only work in their own interests.

They also bend the rules, eg using systems like DEFT where they offload their business costs onto tenants. They provide 2 'free' ways to pay eg money order, but in reality that is more expensive to a tenant than DEFT."
Longer lease agreements
GETTING OWNERS ON BOARD WITH THE NECESSARY THINGS THAT NEED DOING I.E FENCES FLOODING AND TREES MAINTAINED
Having house inspections less frequently for long term (more than 10 years) tenants
Better communication from real estate
"The RTA needs to train their staff better. Advice given to Owner's is always negative.  Tenant""s are often given favorable because RTA staff have not asked enough questions to correctly evaluate the situation."
Property owners can not discriminate against pet owners
"I really dislike so many rental inspections....I dread each one and feel so much stress about it.  We have no say of when the inspection is planned for and if it doesn't work with our schedule, the rental agency has not been willing to change the date for us....so we are stuck with whatever they plan.  Which is not a fair agreement."
Make it harder to reject pets. I have a cat and it’s really hard to find somewhere that will accept her.
Renters are treated like customers and not leper’s!!
"Don't let owners discriminate against pet owners. Additionally, have real consequences for owners receiving breaches from renters."
More collaborative and proactive rental agents.
A better system to show landlords good tenants. Currently the only systems in place show records for bad tenants. 
Easier way to report maintenance. Cheaper rent.
More pet friendly rentals
"As a property owner it can cause financial hardship when tennants do not regularly pay their rent on time as they are given a number of warnings and then you are further delayed waiting for the real estate manager to pay the owners.

As a tennant, there are a lot of demands for entry to the property with no consultation or negotiation on acceptable entry times. They just issue entry notices and you are required to shuffle things around or just allow them to let trades take the keys and enter on their own."
More pet friendly homes that understand cats are in door animals 
Have never rented. Was in Defence housing and now own investment properties
To allow pets in all rentals.... also I wish there was a rating system on property management 
More transparency between tenancy and agency 
If an issue arises involving  with neighbours  causing the discomfort an peace of other neighbours an there well being an mental health  ... which results in them being evicted for their actions. ...  the other tenants should be allowed to BREAK LEASE under the circumstances for their safety an well being an due stress as property manager/ owner  has a duty of care ....so a lease contract should be allowed to end with giving written notice to leave ....  speaking myself with current experience. ...
"Better, more professional behaviour from real estate agents. "
"Not getting kicked out if I don't want to sign a new lease, it should go automaticly to a month by month agreement"
"Make the requirements for a real estate agent licence stricter, and increase compliance and enforcement."
Remove the ability for landlords to evict 'without cause'.  At least give tenant equal rights to redress - it is breaking a contract and should be treated as such
Making it easier for responsible pet ownership
Changes need to be made giving renters more rights!
"Make periodic leases upto the tenant, forcing tenants into leases causes way to many issues let alone the costs associated with forcing lease renewals to be signed. "
My rent would not be as high as it is.
"Tenancy Agreements that have longer terms than 12 months.  As I have a child, I would like the stability of knowing I can live in the same place for several years whilst my child is attending school."
Easier process when looking/applying for a rental
We would love to be able to put up pictures and things on the walls. 
Allowed to have a dog or cat. Alot of houses that I looked at didn't allow pets in general
Quicker turn around for pet applications
"Rental agencies require training and reinforcement of values like respect, honesty, integrity."
"Housing inspections to be every 4 months as standard, rather than every 3 - 4 months. Decrease the time frame for tenants that landlords/agents have concerns about, such as abandonment, etc, but for those in good standing, have a set every 4 months, unless otherwise arranged."
Inspection should only be done once a year !  Longer contracts 
Allow pets at all properties
Remove the right for a real estate to force you to pay via a third party payment provideder
"Longer rental leases. 6 months or even 12 months is far too short a time to be able to plan for the future. Australia is the only western country with such short lease times. In Britain and the USA, it's considered normal to have leases for 5 or even 10 years. "
"I would love to move to a one bedroom unit, but I am stuck in a studio apartment"
"The way water is charged, I would like it charged to tenants on an account like an electricity account instead of being measured through the property manager."
Minimise delays in tenancy court actions.
"Cheaper rental properties, better quality rental properties, the ability to safely secure furniture to the walls for childrens safety and improving the ability to make the house a home (gardening etc)."
"Reduce the amount if entry inspections! Calbri Real Estate enter for routine inspections every 3 to 4 months which is very annoying for a very good tenant. Change that law that they can only enter for routine inspections  every 8 months or twelve months.
I had Calbri enter my house five times in four week to sell the house and then three weeks later they entered for a routine inspection - this law needs to change. There is so much work to clean etc for an inspection and for them to sell. I emailed them to say they had entered five or so times and there was no need for a routine inspection but the refused and entered anyway. "
Not having to be inspected every 3 months.
"Stop Property Managers from doing repair jobs when they have no trade qualifications so they can't frustrate tenants. They should only use qualified tradesmen ie: Plumbers ,builders etc"
"Clearer documentation of entry and exit reports, especially when it comes to cleaning at time of handover"
More rights for Agents/Landlords to remove Tenants who breach their agreements.
Require all rentals to be handled by a registered managing Agency
"There isn't one thing but for the survey - make tenants more responsible for cleaning and looking after the property.  If they are ever to own their own property they will need these skills. For example - cleaning the hair and scum from shower and sink drains, cleaning leaves from gutters, mowing lawns, weeding the garden, not dragging furniture across timber floors and scratching, washing curtains or other window treatments, washing internal walls, cleaning windows, cleaning the shower without damaging the glass - the type of cleaning and care a homeowner is responsible for. "
Landlords have more authority when dealing with an errant tenant
More availability for pets allowed
Request to the property manager to address trimming of tree branches takes ages to be completed. Still pending  :(
Tenants must give longer notice of vacating
"Make a tenancy agreement a regular contract that can be broken as soon as either party doesn't uphold their responsibilities. Currently the tenant has to stay in the property if the owner fails to maintain, keep it clean, make it ready for renting etc. Make it possible to simply end the contract. This way the tenant can complete the ECR and decide to walk away if needed (breach at start of tenancy) or they may have repeated breaches of privacy by the owner after which they can terminate the contract and leave ASAP."
"That when inspections are done, the agents don't make you feel inferior just because you rent and for them to realise that you live in the house and it is not just a display home."
Properties should have mandatory structural safety checks at regular intervals. Too many people risk their life and health in properties that are unsafe to live in.
Property should have mandatory safety inspections prior to leasing and at routine intervals during a tenancy.
Provide clearer deadlines for when rent payment is due
More training and requirements for real estates to be up to date with regulations surrounding tenancies.  
Enforced damage repairs.
Not having inspections every 3 months - invasion of privacy by some unqualified office jerk
"Reduce maximum allowable bond from 4 weeks to 2 weeks, and reduce maximum allowable rent in advance from 2 weeks to 1 week."
"Being able put things up on walls 
Pet friendly 
I hate having to pay extra rent because they use them for collecting that costs me an extra $6.40 per week & that’s over $300 for year."
"I would like a detail reciept each time we pay rent to make it easy to know where we are up, as we like to keep payments in advance. 

"
More flexibility to improve a properties condition and not having to disclose whether pets are kept on property - if the property is maintained and returned in the same condition it’s irrelevent whether pets are kept on the property. 
Please improve overall house quality. 
"I would have it included in legislation the ability to be able to home share whilst renting. There are many mutual benefits for the renter and the landlord, unfortunately we only see the negative stories aired in the media. "
"This ridiculous condition that whoever is first to submit their bond form will receive the bond being held by RTA. If one party tries to negotiate  then they run the likely risk that the other party simply submitted the bond form. You then have to contest and it goes to QCAT where even if you're right, you can't retrieve your lost work hours. "
Better allowance for pets 
Almost everything but I would definitely  get agents to write down things that they said they would do before signing any lease as clearly - they lie.
More experienced property managers 
Having things fixed even if there not life threatening 
Rental increase to be linked to infaltion. 
Have a register of bad landlords & real estate agents available 
I'd really like for improvements to be made in the quality of housing available for renters and the affordability. 
How hard it is to get accepted with a pet -
Overall we have had positive rental experiences but our last real estate agent caused a great deal of stress when we ended our lease. We could have done with more support from RTA.  My children have experienced similar issues in their rental situations. We are quality tenants and appreciate respect and good communication from our agent (fortunately this time we have a good real estate). RTA needs to be consistent with the information provided by different staff members and needs to offer greater support.  There needs to be more rights for the tenants because at present it seems to be more in favour of the landlord/real estate.
"Less restrictions when needing to cease a contract. Having essential things repaired in a timely matter- I’ve had windows and doors that wouldn’t open/ close, faulty fire alarms, no heating and that’s just the start. "
More affordable rent in the private sector. Take the pressure off govt. housing.
Landlords to take better care of their properties and fix things quickly
More communication between tenant and agent. Sometimes I just feel that we are on the second or third place behind the owner and agency. 
"Rebalancing power and security back towards renters (less ultimate power for landlords) - longer and more secure tenancies, better negotiating power."
ability to have a pet cat and/or dog without special permission 
Less dodgy real estate agents.
ONCE TENANT HAS OCCUPIED PREMISES MORE THAN ONE YEAR AND HAS PROVED THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN MAINTAINED WELL ROUTINE INSPECTIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED EVERY FOUR MONTHS RATHER THAN EVERY THREE MONTHS
"Allowing tenants more options with a propery. Example, solar panels or modificatins if the tenant is willing to pay for it and it does not devalue the property."
Make it easier and clearer to find information about who to contact when there are issues for renters and how to escalate problems to have them resolved
consumer protection given the inflation of property rental prices
Ensuring renting agencies do not take advantage of new renters.
"The right to privacy, photos taken inside the house, particularly of bedrooms,bathrooms & living areas, areas considered private & personal. Unless there is damage or a maintenance issue, photos are unnecessary particularly when a property manager inspects the premisses every 3 months. A right to privacy is expected from any other business/organisation. The clause for photographs has recently been added to our standard lease, as  tenants we are not asked for permission/consent simply expected to accept this. We should have the right to say no!"
Pets allowed in all rentals
"The agency charging so much to have the house cleaned after we moved out.  When we moved in it was so dirty we had to clean it for 3 days before I'd even let my child enter the house.  I had photos, but the rental agency said since they weren't time stamped we could have faked them.  Very disappointing.  I didn't realize that I had to have so much proof.  I even verbally spoke to our agent about how bad it was when we moved in. "
Landlords should be allowed to get relief faster when a tenant is not paying rent and damaging the property
Perhaps a grading system for tenants. High class tenants get. 100% based on their history and bad tenants get a really low score 
Unbais party completes both the entry and exit inspection. Currently the real estate has too much power.
"Make pets more universally accepted, allow longer term rental leases"
Real estate agents have an appalling concept of customer service. They mistreat customers - which I guess must be a result of bad tenants in the past.  Renters are paying money and bringing income to them and they should be at least well educated and have manners for dealing with people. They seem to be interested ONLY in ticking the legal boxes of compliance. They do not want to assist the Tennant in any way. They evade repairs or maintenance and leave tenants on they own so they end repairing themselves out of frustration.
"In reference with my previous rentals and not my current one...

Minimum requirement's for rental properties to have security/fly screens.   fans/heating dependent on the locations extreme weather, and dishwashers provided.  As all owners would require in their houses. 


Requests of tenants to not have to interact with owners directly if they choose. 


Properties that don't have/or allow you to put pictures on the wall, which makes the home not feel homely.
"
"Pet friendly, over 100 houses applied for in 12 months with no success "
Told our unit was being renovated and given 6 weeks to leave. This had been our HOME for ten years. Then we're told we could reapply to move back in once renovations were completed. Our rent would increase because of the fenovations by approx $40 per week!
"The private rental market in Queensland is a fundamentally insecure form of housing. There are a number of things that could be done to improve this, including changing attitudes to property investment, greater regulation of private rental housing providers, encouraging the development of a build to rent sector offering long term tenancies to low to moderate income renters (not just community housing), and improving the consumer protection framework & state government assistance available for households whose tenancies are at risk due to a temporary loss of income."
Tenants rights far excede landlords rights.  The landlord is so often left with a huge bill with no means of compensation.  Tenants are very manipulative  and the tenancy agreements need more specific details that are biding when it comes to court.
"Ask for a fairer experience from the real estate agents who manage the property.  They are judgemental, one sided, and treat me like a second class citizen.  They are never thankful or grateful for me paying rent on time and looking after the landlords property, are always dissatisfied about everything from weeds in the grass to requests to negotiate on the rental agreement. And have encouraged an environment when they take weeks to months to fix any maintenance issues in the house and have an encredible way of blaming me.if I dare to complain.  And did I say they NEVER answer the phone if I call the office, I can never get past the receptionist, as they are always “in a meeting”."
"Having an independent platform (preferably government run) where I could submit tenant information once and then apply for tenancies, rather than having to fill out different systems for every different potential landlord."
"The amount of bond should be lower for renters who have a good, reliable history of paying rent on time and who have also demonstrated they have looked after the property they resided in.


"
"More time between inspections - every three months is way too often, puts too much pressure on tenants and seems unnecessary when we pay a large bond initially. 
No picture should be taken and recoded during regular inspections "
"Owners of property need some sort of
Punishment/fine if they turn up at property without proper notices"
The aggression you experience when leaving 
Have tenants held accountable for damage and not paying rent
Tenant shoild pay all water charges.
"Stricter laws on asking tenants to leave   IF they are negligent on the rent payments, or abusive.  The system can allow them to stay through QCAT process for 6 weeks!"
"Stop having inspections every 4months - it’s overkill. Also, every property needs to be pet friendly. "
more flexible leasing agreements.
I’ve had bad experiences with both instances the owners of the property and realestate didn’t communicate very well. So I think more communication.
Have something in place for rental agencies to be held accountable for a duty of care to the tennant and not just the owner
"Being made fully aware of my rights and what I was entitled to as a renter. Specifically in regards to the maintenance of the home, real estates never get back to you about requests and you are often left to pay for things that the landlord should be keeping up to date for their investment property."
"Making airbnb as one of offical renting platform
relax some council rules for short term rental
allow more short term rental in inner suburb area"
That the rental amount per week asking price  should match the quality of the property . At moment run down and shabby properties are attracting high rental amounts based on area not quality / location and not on the state of the property .
"Altering laws such that smokers (cigarettes, cigars, pot, so on) are easily held responsible for detriment to amenity and peaceful enjoyment of neighbours caused by their selfish and inconsiderate smoking. This is an immense problem in crowded city suburbs, and with nicotine widely available in consumable forms that don't stink or aren't impossible-to-contain smelly aerosols, and with tobacco smoke proven to damage the health of bystanders, there's no justification for the 'freedom' or 'right' of a smoker to smoke where their smoke drift affects others."
"1) Please don't make it a ""right"" for tenants to have pets in my home. Reasons below.
2) Please don't give tenants the 'rights' to make repairs. Reasons below.
Reasons
1) Responsible pet owners who can afford to pay the rent will always get a property - because there are so few applicants these days without a dog. Our tenants have a dog - but we were able to check their references. This is MY home, I pay the mortgage, and dogs cause damage that is not able to covered by a bond. Dogs scratch soft timber floors - you can't sand after every tenant - it costs thousands and dust goes through the whole house. Floorboards only have a few ""sands"" in them or you have to replace the whole floor. The damage done by one tenant with a dog is not appreciated by the next tenant - the wear and tear on a home from an irresponsible pet owner is heart breaking and cumulative. If applicants are responsible pet owners and come with references, they will get a property. Tenants who are irresponsible pet owners should NOT have the 'right' to rent my home. 
Dogs can not just scratch but cause a lot of expensive damage to timber floors. 
They eat door surrounds when owners out all day at work. 
They tear up the grass. 
One tenant simply cut a hole in the carpet every time her dog pooed inside. Would you like her to rent your house and have the 'right' to have a dog.
BOND is not the answer. With successive tenants with pets, the damage gets worse each time, but how do you charge for a scratch?
YES to pets with references - at owner's discretion.
NO to tenants have the 'right' to have pets inside MY home.
2) Please don't give tenants the 'right' to make small repairs and put nails in walls etc
You can't assume a tenant knows how to bang in a nail and install curtains.
A tenant installed a curtain (didn't ask - we would have done this) and tore all the plaster because they didn't put it into the stud behind, their children pulled on the curtain etc
You have to hang heavy paintings on nails banged into a stud - not into the plaster.
Many tenants can't even change a light bulb or tap washer without causing more damage.



"
We have rented this property for around 3 years and have no complaints.
Communication from real estate to be consistent and not patronizing.
"RTA Rental bond release procedures.  We are a landlord and for one of our properties, the RTA released the bond before consulting with our agency.  The RTA claim that they advised the agency in writing that the tenant had submitted a request for bond release, however, the agency did not receive this information.  The RTA should not release bond until the tenant and landlord have been consulted and acknowledged correspondence from the RTA.  It is not unusual for emails etc. to not be received.  In this instance, the property damage exceeded the bond amount and the tenant was inappropriately provided the bond in full by the RTA, claiming that they had sent information to the agency and the agency did not respond. The agency did not receive the RTA information regarding the tenants request for the bond.  This faulty process led to a lot of stress for us as landlords afterwards, as the tenant refused to pay for the damage caused."
Being able to let the owner know when the real estate is not doing their job properly 
"Wasn't allowed pets
Felt worried about reporting faults in the Rental property multiple times - didn't want to be perceived as a 'nuisance' despite the fact that contractors employed by the  rental agency did a poor job."
More support and faster turnaround on maintenance issues
"Making it easier to have pets. I have rented with pets for many years,  but it always requires negotiation and a lot of searching when needing to move. "
Other tenants in multi unit apartments NOT being able to smoke on balconies.
Security requirements for rental houses
To be able to hang pictures on the walls of the house .
Too hard to self manage
"Longer leases like they do in Europe with more certainty and stability for renters in relation to unjustified evictions and unreasonable rent increases - stable, long-term tenants are more likely to take care of their home and contribute to the local community. Being able to hang pictures on walls would also be nice ... and the ability to have small pet(s). Especially with housing being so unaffordable now and with renting on the rise across all demographics, these things need to be looked at.

*The last rental property I was a tenant for 8 years but I was only told 60 days beforehand that I would have to move - this was over the Christmas summer period so not the best time to look for and find a place (especially when you work full time), and finding the extra money for moving. If it was a family with young children going through this, I could only imagine how difficult a situation this would be."
"There should be some protections in place to protect both Landlords and Tenants.
We have found some wonderful Landlords who maintain their properties in immaculate condition and these Landlords should not be tied down by government regulations and charges.
Likewise we have seen some wonderful tenants mostly who care for - clean and polish the place and make it their own. Government should only intervene to protect both Landlords and Tenants from the extremes on both sides of the fence - and there are not many. Those landlords from hell who do nothing to help their tenants and maintain infested rotholes crowded with underprivileged people paying for poor property. The tenants from hell who wreck and destroy a place to satisfy their own frustrations with life.
"
Make it harder for rental property owners to unjustifiably raise rent.
"Tenants know how to play the system.  There need to be more protections for landlords (increased bonds, legislated prepayment of rent).  At the moment we have a tenant that has been evicted for non-payment of rent, refuses to hand back the key.  By the time a warrant of possession is granted we will have lost 6 weeks rent and will have to pay for the clean up.  All this is not covered by the bond or insurance (because it is not malicious).  This has happened to us numerous times.  We do not refuse reasonable requests from tenants but are now at the point of selling because of the cost. It's all good and well going to QCAT and getting a judgement but then you have no chance of recovering any funds."
The ability to have long-term leases of more than 12 months 
"Renters have too many ""powers"" over landlords..
I have now had 2 consecutive tenants leave with bills of nearly $6000 each, which I have to chase through to QCAT...
The QCAT experience is about whats ""Fair and Reasonable"", but appears to be only for the tenant! I'd love to have my decisions explained by a professional on how it relates to the Tenancy laws!"
Rental management releasing BOND when I as the property owner can clearly see work charged in maintenance not as per original... Removing a $500 tape from the kitchen and replacing it with $110 Bunnings. And not returning tape to owner.
More pet friendly rentals 
Communication between renters and the real estate
Not making any more red tape for tenants or landlords 
Consider pets in more properties
"Consistent process undertaken by all real estate agencies.
As you don’t deal with the owners directly I feel the agencies dictate their own internal process to tenants which makes it a long drawn work by a tenant to satisfy the real estate needs only."
Ruling around tenants bond refunds after abandong houses it should be automatically refunded to owner not the owner fighting for it back
"The RTA is a farce, when you call up either as a tenant or a property manager with a question, the answer is always “that’s a grey area”. In Victoria if you call the RTBA with a question you are given a definitive answer - which gives all parties direction to resolve issues. The RTA is actually a laughing matter with all property managers, we kind of have to make up rules - and this is ‘not’ what we want to do. We want what is fair, ‘not’ to tell a tenant or landlord ‘this is a grey area’."
"That the rent doesn't increase every year, it becomes unaffordable. "
The Legislation which is balance too much in favour of the tenant.
Owners and real estates need to be held more accountable for lack of action when it comes to maintenance.  There also needs to be more accountability around clear money grabbing rent risers
"1. Quarterly house inspections do not identify the condition of the house, not identifying wear and tear. It is the exit inspection that the property manager begins to identify defects, in an attempt to keep the bond. It is then an exhaustive process to argue ""reasonable wear and tear""
2. Real estates are not accountable for their role in managing the property and repairs. When seeking compensation for a broken dishwasher, which was from the mismanagement by the real estate, I could only seek compensation from the owner; who was not aware or responsible for the issue. "
Completing maintenance of things needing fixing. Sticking to their word about getting something done. 
"Not impose conditions on landlords that doesn't apply to ALL home owners.
Unfair that tenants only have to give 2 weeks notice must be AT LEAST one month"
Allow tenants to terminate their lease once the owner puts it up for sale
The owners need to take greater care to maintain their property by cutting down dangerous trees.
Improved auditing of property management agencies.
Real estate agents showing properties outside business hours to accommodate people who work.
"Leave the current setup in place.  There is no need to change it.   
The tenants that pay there rent and dont damage rental properties find it easy to rent.  Those tenants that dont pay and trash rental properties have no right to be given additional properties to trash.

The solution is simple
The properties belong to landlord
so
Tenants should exersise their right to choose a property that suits their needs
Tenants should pay their rent on time or make arrangements in times of need that suit both parties
Tenants should keep the rental property clean and undamaged

Landlords should keep the property maintained

All fixed
"
Get things fixed repaired more easily.
Pets should be allowed for all rental properties. 
Allow pets. In Europe and UK pets go everywhere with their owners!! They are good for individual's health and wellbeing! Scientifically proven. With mental health being a huge health care burden this is a social response to a significant issue!!
Allow small pets in more places
Tenants being able to keep pets
People should have the security in renting a home/unit  etc for years instead of having to renew contracts every six to twelve months.  
The process to apply and be selected is extremely non-transparent. I think that rental agencies have the tendency to take advantage of the renters harbouring a very nasty rental culture.
The lack of communication and responsibilities from agents.
More equitable/balance of rights between Lessors and tenants
Change the way condition entries are completed so there is smooth transition between the changing of real estate managers. 
A way to ensure QCAT monies are paid without further legal action if relevant. 
Provide more rights to people renting
I have rented numerous properties and been told the carpets were professionally cleaned but have proof they were not I would like to see carpet cleaners and real estate agents submit photographic proof time and date stamped as proof of work done not just receipts
Quicker response times to correct issues with the properties.
"Protection of the renter, perhaps home owners should put forth a bond too. I lived in a house with a friend who had asthma. One night the roof leaked and it leaked bad. The leak was fixed but damage had been done black mould was growing in the carpets and roof which was effecting my friends ability to breath (because of the asthma) we had to wait months before someone came out to fix the carpets and the roofs never got done because the owner wasn't willing to pay. We THEN started getting electrocuted by the water in out house coming out of our taps and faucets. It took weeks to have people come out and fix it and at that point they deemed the house we were living in unlivable. It took weeks and multiple people out for quotes to get that fixed. In the mean time we were kicked out of the house with only a week that we didn't have to pay rent as compensation. (We were out of the house for longer than that) some sort of funds need to be put aside so that in serious cases like these emergency repairs that need to take place can be done without having to convince and owner that life threatening faults in the house need to be repaired. "
"Bond - the whole process is difficult. It's difficult to save for a new bond if you're already in a rental property, meaning you are effectively stuck there. It's difficult to objectively assess bond returns - agents know that they have the upper hand and will often exploit renters by not taking standard wear and tear of a property into account when assessing exit reports. It's difficult as a renter to know what your rights are without damaging the relationship with your agent which can affect your bond return. In my last rental property, I agreed to released my bond before knowing how much it was going to cost to have repairs done, and then it took almost six weeks for the agent to return the bond to me. Technically it had already been released from RTA so RTA could do nothing, and the agent just had my money sitting in their trust account accruing interest for weeks while I struggled to pay rent at my next place. "
That a simple summary of the rights and obligations of both tenants and landlords are provided to both tenants and landlords at the commencement of a lease.
Holding real estate agents account to questions and improvements to the place you live in. 
I find the real estate agents often are unreasonable with their inspections upon vacating properties. I have rented all my life and they nearly always found something to make getting my bond back stressful. I have even taken things to dispute resolution in order to get my bond back. 
Decrease the prices to increase demand. We don’t want to become like the bigger cities and increase the cost of living for renters
The frequency at which property managers can enter your home / schedule people to be entering your home.  
"We have the ability to lodge defaulting tenants on a database, we should also be able to lodge un-appropriate landlords on such databases."
Have property inspections only carried out when agreement has been reached to extended the rental agreement.  Constant inspections by unknown people walking through the house and photographing your personal belongings feels like an invasion of privacy and takes away the feeling of creating a safe home environment.
Rental managers being less condescending to renters. Maintenance being completed in a timely manner. 
"Real estate agents are a massive impediment to repairs and approval of pets and other matters. Real estate agents are an inappropriate cohort to be managing rental properties, they are poorly paid, poorly trained and there is no incentive for them to take care of the tenant or the property. I have had many experiences of real estate agents refusing repairs or not dealing with simple issues and they are often a barrier to improving tenants lives. They should be replaced by dedicated public service registry where rental properties can be listed, and which can manage collecting rent, making repairs, etc. If this is too hard, there should be enforcement mechanisms that do not result in  retaliatory eviction. "
Better communication between tenants and agents
"easier ways to view all available properties, especially units/apartments"
being able to put pictures and photos on the walls 
"Property Owners are usually very slow to reply to any information request, and unfairly make decisions.

For instance, we have request fly screens be installed at our house to stop insects coming in when we need to open the house during hot weather. 

The owners took over a week to respond and their response was ridiculous. ""When building the house we were told fly screens would be ineffective"". (?!?!) and ""Just use the air conditioner"". these responses are not satisfactory, and make no sense."
"'- I was relocating to QLD from NSW last year, and had long-service leave of three months after working for the state government for over ten years. My partner (who had secured full-time employment already in QLD) and I submitted an application for a rental property in Beachmere (4510) and the real estate agent was rude and condescending - stating she wasn't going to even process our application because I ""didn't even have a job"". Agents should be more respectful and understanding of people wanting to relocate interstate and the difficulties of seeking employment prior to relocating. I am not a dole bludger and have always had steady employment.
- The next real estate agent we submitted an application for approved our application for a rental property in Beachmere. However, our property manager was rude and when I attended the office she refused to see me in person, always getting the receptionist to speak to me. The receptionist was slow in sending us water bills but then very prompt in telling us to hurry up and pay them. When a faulty sensor in the water tank on the property caused the tank to draw in more water from the town supply, causing the tank to overflow and resulting in a LARGE water bill, we were forced to pay the bill even though it was not our fault that the sensor malfunctioned. Real estate agents should be understanding of such situations and make exceptions.
- When renting in NSW, I was able to terminate my lease before the agreed term by paying a fee. This should be made available in QLD rather than making the tenant continue to pay rent until a new tenant/lease is signed. Financially, this is not a viable option for many people. I was working in Wacol and driving from Beachmere everyday - the drive was almost two hours both ways. There is a limited number of people looking to move and rent in Beachmere (unless they work around the Caboolture area) and it would be impossible for us to pay rent if we moved closer to my work AND on the Beachmere property while the real estate dragged out time to find a 'suitable tenant'. I was forced to stay in Beachmere for 6 months until our lease expired all because of this - I was exhausted from driving back and forth such a great distance every day and my quality of life suffered. If tenants are able to pay a fee to have their lease terminated so that they can move, rather than having to keep paying rent - it will SIGNIFICANTLY improve the renting experience in QLD. 
- Both agents we have rented through in QLD have demanded that our pets not be allowed in the house. I have two small handraised birds - they are used to human company and without it they screech a lot. My agent in NSW was very understanding and allowed the birds inside the house without issue - however here we have been forced to sign the lease agreeing to have all animals outside the house at all times. This is unfair - my birds have not adjusted well to this after we have moved from NSW."
"More accountability on the property manager side. There already is a power imbalance being a tenant and I have experienced several times where the property manager doesn't do their job correctly or ignores rules, but being a tenant I'm at their discretion of getting my bond back "
"Pets apart from Fish in a fish-tank are very problematic in apartment complexes and should be band. Pets like Dogs, Cats, Birds all can create absolutely disturbing noises, odours and transference of diseases to neighbouring apartments. Very few owners of Pets are Responsible Owners and are able to keep their Pet's under control at all times based on my experiences and the ongoing list of complaints are to enormous to refute or ignore. It's one thing for Pet Owners to have a Pet's within the Boundaries of normal Residential Dwellings where there are set backs and yard spaces to Neighbouring Properties that provides some buffer space from Pet noises (barks, howls, me-ows, tweets, crows, etc.) and odours from faeces or their state of uncleanliness but their is no such luxury of buffer in neighbouring apartment complexes. This is where these types of Pets should be band in it's entirety from Apartment Complexes. "
How property managers manage the property with repairs and general inspections to keep up with how the property is being taken care of and if repairs need doing to do them in a reasonable manner and time not months later or when it suites them!
"You are not allowed to feel properly at home and feel that you are very much a second class citizen when renting, despite your reasons for doing so. Allowing pets and/or visiting pets would be a start. I work away from home and my wife cannot visit due to our small house trained, non-casting dog."
"When a tenant has been in a rental property for longer than 12 months without any problems noted on inspections, the frequency of inspections should be reduced."
"under current tenancy rulings, there should be a larger bond requirement as a landlord can lose out financially  if a tenant gets in arrears, leaves the property and damages have occurred and need to be repaired by landlord.
 With the time frames of waiting for rent to be in arrears before you can issue a breac h and then allowing time for tenant to possibly get rent paid up to date again, you can lose all the bond simply through lost rent and then nothing is available if damages need to be repaired. "
"We are unable to get air con because of the body corporate which in Queensland is ridiculous. 

Also not able to have pets in certain places "
Would be lovely to own pets. Many who have anxiety or simply want a dog or cat to add to the family can not as very very few rentals allow for animals 
"Add more balance between tenant and rental property owner interests. Almost all the rules are skewed in favor of the rental property owner's favour. Also, rental agencies have too much power disfavouring tenants."
Improved customer service by rental agents
"That rental properties can’t be rented until they pass an inspection that verifies the property is of a reasonable standard. Ie. no paint flaking off the walls,  any mold is under control, in general good working order _before_ tenants move in."
More and better communication from the Leasing Agent.
Stronger legislation to protect owners from damages to home from tenants. Clearer communication to tenants of their obligations when renting.
More rentals should accept pets
The fear of something withing the property going bad and you would receive the blame. I think there would need an independent party to inspect the house and have professional opinion on things that have gone wrong to determine if the renter actually caused damage. 
"Allow owners to determine if they allow pets. Home Units are not conducive to Dogs in particular, and once allowed is very hard to 'police' behaviour. In particular the problem of a dog barking whilst owner absent."
Make it illegal to be able to deny having pets in a rental property. People in units shouldn't be denied the opportunity to have a pet because they are renting when properties are suitable for pets. Add an extra 20% to the bond for cleaning if the owners are worried about a problem with potential damage.
"Being able to live in property as if it is your home, being able to put up pictures etc (whilst still maintaining clean well cared for property)
"
I have rented for 20 years (never owned) and I have an excellent rental record. I find regular 3 monthly inspections intrusive and it also induces a range of emotions related to having to continually prove myself a worthy tenant. It brings to the surface an ever present awareness that this is not my home. Time and after time I have demonstrated that I take care of the property and I always pay rent on time. After a point surely there could be some lenience - e.g. reduce inspection frequency over time to once a year only? 
Bond transfers from one rental to the next. Being able to pay off anything that needs to come out of yoyr bond through your centrelink or a sper debt etc. 
Be more present in cleaning and maintaining house
"Better communication between realestate agents, tenants and landlords. Nearly all experiences I've had with realestate agents have been horrendous. "
Better enforcement of standards so shit tenants dont ruin it for rest of us.
"Look at the Swiss laws. It should be like there:
Ability to hang up paintings, no inspections, repairs need to be done immediately
Rent raises only when costs have gone up
Rent reducing when costs or mortgages have gone down
Easy accessible court processes for free

"
Tenants needs more control over the things they were promised
"Ensure that the bond is not being used by the real estate to hold you to rants.  Real Estates seem to find always ways to keep some of the money of the bond. It is not fair on the people who take care of the home and leave it immaculate. No matter what you will never see the bond being returned in full. 
There should also be a better legal stand in what is regarded as wear and tear."
Post-lease inspections. Real estate tried to nit pick every to ensure I got as little bond back as possible. It felt like they were just making up excuses to try and keep it.
That some real estates and home owners have in realistic goals when it come to leaving in a home. They expect you to leave the home in its current state but sometime bumps and scratches happen and if they are fixed up then what’s the problem. So what I would want to change is their unrealistic views on how a home should be left 
Not having to continuing to pay break lease. To be able to give one month's notice and then move on.
Reduce the rent a little.
Changing property managers earlier than we did
Make the rental process simpler for international students with less paperwork while maintaining the rights of the tenant
The agents attitude and behaviour
"The Landlord should have the correct level of property insurance to cover for accidental damage & the tenant should not be responsible for having to pay high excesses as the landlord is getting cheaper insurance with high excesses.   
If the tenant causes wilful/intentional damage then it's a different story."
"There is an owness on the tenant to immediately fix small issues as directed to by the rental agency with priority and negative consequences for not doing so, but there is no oversight or scruteny on the rental agency to ensure the lessors responsibilities to tenant. Eg. We’ve been instructed to clean our fans of dust and if not done so we’d receive a notice to remedy breach. However we have bad wiring and non energy efficient fixtures which they refuse to fix and we have leaking taps which they refuse to fix and no clear path to rememdy with any immediacy. Additionally, in any conflict we are arguing against an agency of people who do this for a living and have in depth knowledge of leasing, while we have little to no knowledge."
"Less frequent and invasive inspections - especially after the first year in the house. Maybe twice a year, very strictly looking only at issues that affect the property (not breakfast dishes in the sink at 8.30am). Photos only of issues of the property (cracks in ceilings etc), not photos of whole rooms that just show tenants posessions."
Better collaboration with landlord
"Having more reasonable rules around how real estate agents operate, and their ability to manage landlords better. "
Allowing tenats that cannot afford the bind straight up to pay it off iver time
"The real estates having the tenants best interests at heart, they are all for the owners as they are payed by the owners. I would also change inspections every three months, I think the first one should be after a few weeks then once they can see you are keeping the property to standard, every 6 months."
"Wall handing
Air conditioning"
"Inspections, rent prices for home quality
Rent is far too high for homes that are low quality, regardless of area a home must be deemd suitable to live in at a reasonable price."
"Exit and entry eports conducted by agents are often far different to what the new tenant provides.  Often there are areas missed by the agent and at other times the most insignificant thing is disputed.  There is NO consistency with agents and their standards of cleanliness.  There is massive disparity between what's expected from one agency to the other with regards to payment avenues, often negatively impacting on the renter and costing the renter more money."
Experience with the RTA. They often give conflicting advice.
"Property managers following through on policy, maintenance, timely communications, and not continually sending invoices for invoices that have been paid months ago. "
"'- Allow pets by default
- lower frequency of rental inspections, e.g. only every 6-12 months rather than every 3..."
"Access to decent internet. Access to current standards of pay tv, current building doesn’t allow pay tv. "
Quarterly inspection irrespective of tenant track record
changing the inspection times for long term renters. Maybe every 4-6months after 2 years in the same property. Allowing pets without discrimination.  
"There is a huge imbalance between Tenants and Landlords. Property values and rentals are at an all time low while Council Rates, Insurance and other Government requirements are continually increasing the costs to Landlords without any means of funding these costs.
This will inevitably result in collapse of the rental market and the inability of Landlords to equitably fairly service Tenants reasonable requests.  This beneits no one "
Home owners need to be regulated. They take advantage of the tenants and disregard tenant rights.
Tenants to have more legal rights and not to get constantly screwed over by real estates and owners
"Allow any pets, just assure tenants look after the property well with pets on premises and allow tenants to be able to hang pictures to make a house feel like a home just as long as tenants fix all nail/hook holes etc. Before leaving. "
"Timely repairs
Pets
Treatment at inspections"
Renters has a bit more respect from the property manager dealing with the renter
"Penalties on real estate managers/owners that make bond claims that are in direct conflict with regulations, in order to decrease the amount of dishonest claims. And mandatory repair periods once notification given and breech notices ignored."
More power to the landlords in cases of neglect. 
Rents are unnecessarily high stop landlords from charging excessive rent for very mediocre houses some are no better than slums. How can i save for my own home and pay ridiculously high rent.
Renters are not second class citizens despite the constant social disdain we face. The biggest issue renters face is landlords Personalising their investment. There is no need for 3-month inspections. Pets should be a given. Security should be a must. 
Holding property managers and owners to higher standards
That landlords get on top of property maintenance straight away instead of using stalling tactics and having to be breached.
availability of long term leases
To have a set time for landlords to reply to repair requests.  Do not know much about this side of renting.
Better quality property managers
"As a renter, not being forced into one year contracts when we've been here for over 10 years."
"Firstly the price, 
Secondly having most assistance renting and transparency on behalf of the leaser or realestate on the expectations of the renter"
Change the law from favouring tenants.
More affordable housing for big families
"I would encourage law reform around legislation governing activities and conduct of rental agents, including the following:

1.  More robust requirements for licencing and minimum education and training requirements for rental agents and rental property owners wanting to act as agents.

2. Continuing professional education as a requirement of holding a rental agents licence.

3.  Regulatory requirements that enforce a code of conduct and penalise agents who do not comply.

4. Legislation restricting the use of Tenant Databases as punitive measures by rental agents to punish tenants.

5. A dedicated independent body to deal with Tenant complaints against rental agents and rental property owners, allowing for restorative and natural justice approaches to dispute resolution.

6. Legislative reform that incorporates a public disciplinary register for rental agents and rental property owners who have breached regulatory and/or legislative requirements. "
More affordable spaces to rent in suburbs that aren't miles from the CBD or filled with drugs and crime.
Not rent with a private landlord
Give landlords more legal rights
Increase the penalties for unapproved subletting especially with respect to AirBnB and other unapproved scams because they just come in to the rental regulations and completely skirt them and this is unfair to everyone else who is involved in residential rental right now
Properties need to be presented at the beginning of the tenancy in the same condition as they are expected to be at the completion of the tenancy.
More oversight and tenant rights in regards to real estate agents.
I would make pet ownership much more possible. I would happily pay a separate bond to cover pets in rentals. 
"Limit the fixed-term contract early termination fee to maximum the amount of 4 weeks rent, unless a new tenant was found earlier."
Accountability for non-action of maintenance items.
Increase renters liability for the damage they may cause 
"We need to be able to have pets, and make modifications for sensory and other special needs."
Have property managers liable for landlord losses when it can be shown that they have not properly checked a tenant ad/or have not fully reported defects present when periodic or end of lease inspections are undertaken. This liability needs to be in Government legislation. 
"Concern always that having a voice and speaking up for our rights will lead to a termination of rent. We recently disputed that our rental agent had not given us the required two months notice for a rent increase, but are coming up for a rent renewal and didn't want to jepoardise our chances."
Costs involved when dealing with QCAT
"Less inspections, more warning for them, better response times to issues such as plumbing or electrical issues, allow tenants to have pets or make small alterations to the property as needed such as painting walls or changing curtains"
Have more support for the owner in relation to the damage that is sometimes made by the tenant and no financial compensation - the bond is not enough to cover anything other than minor damage.
"Bought my own home, not flash but it’s mine, nobody can threaten me with kicking me out because I didn’t blow the grass off the driveway and council footpath immediately after mowing."
"Less ability for landlords to affect the way renters use a property (e.g. requests to remove vegetable gardens, not able to hang pictures on walls). If it doesn't affect the value or condition of the property, renters should be able to use a property as they wish as long as it is returned to its original conditions. "
Been able sign long term lease 5 yrs plus
"Ensure that climate change issues e.g rising temperatures do not impact on renter's quality of life through poor housing design, ineffective or non-existent thermal protection (including insulation) or being written out of benefits from solar and other energy saving initiatives that are otherwise delimited to overhaul of the rental structure/ property."
Not having to pay extra payment processing/transaction fees just to pay my rent with whatever supplier the real estate has chosen. 
I would like property managers to be more proactive about addressing reported maintenance issues.
"I would like to see the time frames increased on Entry Notice (Form 9, Section 5) .. Inspection - 7 days, The others 24 hours .. Seriously, The general time frames are way too small and do not work and more so when posted in the mail! (did you know it can take more than 7 days for a letter posted in Toowoomba to reach another address in Toowoomba).  I understand that when there are issues with a tenant or there is an emergency maintenance issue then swift action is required.  But for general entry they are ludicrous."
We wished that our landlord would have agreed to fix our water tank pump. For the sake of a $250 pump we have lost the potential for saving thousands of litres of water over the 5 years we've been there.
"A reduction in the frequency of inspections. Once every 6 months, rather than every 3."
"Have the option of 1, 2 or 5 year leases become the norm, with increasing freedom to make the place home with the increase in rental term. eg 1 year lease - no changes to the property except picture hooks and the likes; 5 year lease - if tenant wants to repaint, they can repaint - landlord has less say in limiting things like picture hooks/rails etc.
Bottom line - if you're staying long enough to really make it home, let the tenant make it a home; if it's short term (ie 1 year), tenant still deserves comfortable use, but they have a lesser ability to make fundamental changes to the look of the place."
"Making owners take ownership of the poor state of their properties. When paint is chipping because it wasn't primed before being painted, that is not due to renter's negligence, that is due to poor workmanship and property owners should be held responsible for that, not renters. "
Effective protection against being churned in retaliation for complaints.
"1. Fewer routine inspections for tenants that have a proven good track record of maintaining their home.
2. A landlord who improves their rental property to make living in it more homely and understand the area of their rental property. 
    E.g. Install a carport because there has been no consideration to build a shed for storage and the existing 
    garage is used as such, especially if the house is located in an area that experiences high temperatures. 
    "
Perhaps owners property managers need to get realistic about pricing.  especially if its an older tenancy with old fixtures etc. 
"clearer contract terms (eg my contract said I had to pay electricity provider directly for my electricity). The advert also advertised house with solar. After I moved in I found out that account was in landlords name, I wasn't able to change it, and the entire bill was covered by the rebate, yet they still billed me for the whole bill via the real estate agent without any rebate applied - yet I paid extra for a house with solar. The agent was very aggressive, and we actually referred them to our legal department. Agents should have more training and the grey areas in the rules need to be black and white."
TENANTS TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
That property managers/landlords would have some effing empathy and stop thinking that they have the god given right to treat tenants however they like because where else can a tenant go?!
Owner should be made to paint the house. Paint on hose inside and outside peeling of the walls. Garden not maintained before I moved in.
minimum standards of living 
"The only option when a landlord has been issued with a notice to remedy is: They fail to undertake repairs, tenant moves out. There really is no recourse for a tenant to make a landlord made repairs. 

I also wish that bond transfers were still able to be done. Coming up with $3000 to move is no easy feat."
Tenants should be held accountable for their actions.
"My entire rental experience in Queensland has been (with the exception of one owner) one of finding it extremely difficult to get maintenance and repairs done, and, if they finally get done then having the rent increased, unfair rental increases, no Notice of Entry issued on numerous occasions on a number of properties, being assured of reimbursement for enhancements to gardens, etc and then not received a cent, and having to fight to have bonds returned because agents and owners tend to think that the bond is their's for the keeping.  Being directed to use agent's own bond cleaners, or carpet and pest agents and then finding differently from the RTA"
Real estates setting out to make a tenant homeless by defrauding their bank account due to be a an exceptional long term tenant all because of greed and the tenant being on a Disability Support Pension.
"Only one thing? Having less constant entry notices for the most ridiculous things - so very intrusive. It does not feel like your own ""home"". I feel imprisoned and people come and ""fix"" things that don't need fixing all the time. Not getting to negotiate when the rent randomly goes up in a market where there is excessive amounts of vacant rental properties. Not being allowed to negotiate the length of the lease renewals when I have ALWAYS paid in advance and on time for nearly 3 years."
Allow all rental properties to have a pet approved when applying for a property. Children can do more damage to a property then a small pet for example a cat. 
"Pet policy, the shelters are over filled and most places you aren't aloud pets. It's a problem"
I believe that tenants should have to give one months notice to vacate instead of standard 2 weeks. It is just not enough time for the owner. 
Landlords need to have better ways/databases to assess applicants.  All tenants should be required to have their own insurance to cover their contents in the event of an accident.
Tenant and property owners should have described more precisely duties as well the issues should be resolved in a simplify way instead be resolving lengthy and costly by QCAT. Not all expenses are paid back like parking cost time of work and more
"I am completing this survey as I was previously a Property Manager + I also had 2 rental properties.  Most people who, from utter exhaustion and frustration, turn to me for advice, I have to say that I feel for them because of the way they are treated when trying to secure a home.I think the first thing I would change is the way the RTA answer calls.  I'm sure tenants would feel so much better if they could answer a couple of quick questions to ascertain if they have an understanding of ""Renting in Queensland"" and help the operator to analyse their need.  And I change the way Property Managers and the agencies they work for perform their tenancy & property tasks.  Because they are all independent, they seem to set their own rules.  Mind you, business owners should also be subject to rental knowledge in order to assess the pressure the PM's are subject to.  So, a couple of questions in the beginning will assist with a smooth call from the person seeking help. And please don't get me started on Body Corporate & On site Managers. "
Making it easier to end a lease early or less expensive
Actual proof of bulk water notices issued from council before real estates can charge tenents
"The transparency between the tenant and the landlord. The landlord is the clear favourite between the landlord and real estate agent, so perhaps a clear and even base in which the communication is made will ensure all requests are considered in a true and fair manner"
Determine what is maintenance and what is damage 
"Being able to put up pictures without question 
"
Rental increase every time lease renewed - Limit rental increases.
Overly onerous (and outdated) application process.
Less frequent quarterly inspections for tenants who have previously shown that they care for the property over a sustained period of time.
I would love for more real estates treat their renters like clients and less like paupers.
Things need to be fixed in and around the house much quicker then it is now. 
I would make 12 month leases the minimum requirement. It is very disruptive to only have short-term rental accomodation.
Unhelpful Property Managers
Not allow pets in share house arrangement
"Renting a unit within a building with corporate manager  tend to be too expensive related to water ,electricity and gas bills .Also, if you pay for key's copy you don't get your money back "
Streamline eviction process for tenants who don’t pay their rent and who vandalise or seriously damage property. 
Smaller rent increases or less frequent rent increases.
"be given a fair chance. ive perfect credit, great references, always worked, financially stable, but as i'm a single parent with a much loved labrador, it is very tricky to even be looked at for properties. "
Ensuring owners fix broken appliances and where there is obvious mould problem ensure it is rectified by owner asap
"Fewer inspections, if a tenant has a good history of keeping a property maintained and in good clean repair, then less inspections should apply, instead of 3 months it could be every 6 or 12 months instead."
Making sure any rented house has decent air-conditioning in every bedroom.
Not being charged for routine pest control.
stopping illegal entries from agents who pretend they have sent entry notices but have sent them to wrong email addresses.
Making it easier to have pets.  My children and I raised some chicks and had these as pets but when we moved the new owner would not allow us to keep chickens in the large backyard.  Also my children would love a dog or cat but we have not been allowed.
Fair rules for tenant and property owner
"I think a few more things need to be the owners responsibility to maintain, like gardens for example."
Stricter inspections of properties by a third party before real estates are allowed to offer properties for rent.
"'For the long term renters:
- opportunity to do minor improvements to the place e.g. painting and hanging decorative materials without having to seek permission from owners
-smaller annual increments in rent given home owners are guaranteed a tenant for the long term"
Nothing comes to mind
"Allow caravan park operators the power to immediately evict tenants for anti social behaviour, threatening behaviour, violent behaviour, intimidating behaviour, causing fear to staff, other residents or tourists, practising any illegal acts or possessing any illegal items within the caravan park, purposely causing damage or destroying property belonging to the caravan park or any other resident or tourist etc."
Cheaper weekly payments 
"I believe there needs to be a more balanced approach. I am a Land Lord and I often feel that I need to hold my tenants hands as they are unable to look after themselves. Tenants need to have more responsibility when renting as in looking after the house and garden. Coming from overseas I find it hard to believe how spoiled tenants are here and what I have to provide as a Land Lord. I believe certain repairs like leaking taps (new washers), scratches in polished floors etc should be paid for by tenants. These would make a tenants simply start to look after things better when they actually have to pay for damages. I think too that Real Estates need to be better monitored as often Property Managers don't do their job properly and let tenants get away with a lot of stuff. I think they mostly don't care as it is nor their property. I believe there needs much better regulations and staff to be properly trained. "
Have a provision so tenants cannot just stop paying rent 4 weeks before the end of the lease.
"If I lodge my bond first, and the agent disputes a portion i.e. $180 of $2400, the undisputed amount should be released. The last property I rented, they disputed something because they knew they were holding my entire bond to ransom, they used this as leverage. I refused to give in as I was in the right, their claim was invalid so disputed it, the process of mediation and waiting for times to expire, it was over 8 weeks before I got my entire $2400 back. I had to borrow the money from my brother for the next rental property as I couldn't get my bond back in time to put towards the new property."
Equal rights for owners and renters
"Allowing pets more readily within rentals, faster repair or maintenance"
nothing that I can think of at this moment
More severe penalties for property managers who do not comply to the rules.
Allow fpr lomger contracts with predetermined rental increases.
Less frequent inspections. Perhaps 6-monthly instead of 3-monthly.
I would like if we would have a pet and treat the place as is it were out home. Ie. Hang pictures on the walls etc. Whenever we ask our property manager about this they ignore our requests....
"Stronger controls on late / non payment.
Stronger controls on poor tenants - my experience is that landlords have little to no rights and enforcing the rights that are available make it difficult and costly to pursue. There is a strong view by property managers that the law and courts are heavily skewed to benefit the landlord regardless of the circumstances. Paying off $20/w for a non paying ratbag tenant is not reasonable. "
No pets allowed in a property without the written consent of the owner
"It is a little hard when a tenant requests to install items which require drilling into built in cupboards and walls etc. and when permission is not granted, they still go ahead and drill holes and then when they depart never repair the damage caused. It would be great if all tenants treated the properties as if they were there own."
More affordable housing.  STOP fees for paying rent.
Property owners should be able to easily ban pets from their properties
"I personally feel real estate agents are given too much latitude.
I had a very bad experience in Daisy Hill ( and the man is still operating). We were living in an estate close to John Paul College. This man and his wife ‘looked after’ this estate (he owned a re licence and franchise).
He was always abusive (and drunk) to the overseas families who rented there (could tell you mMUCH more but not enough space). When we decided to leave, would not give us our bond even though we cleaned the place and also brought in professional bond cleaners.
We took him to court, whereupon he took a close up photo of the clothesline which he complained had dust 
on it! He and his wife also took out the dishwasher (which had never been used), took a photo of the back of the cupboard it had been encased in and proceeded to tell the Tribunal that we had not pulled out the dishwasher and cleaned the back of the cupboard! 
As you know, to pull out a dishwasher, you need to interfere with the hose.
Anyway, we lost our bond - even though the place was spotless (photos were also provided).
One other point..... why do real estate agents need copies of your bank statements?
Even when your rental records are exemplary!"
"


Accountability. Landlords and especially management agencies are super unresponsive and there is nothing you can do about it. I was once not able to rent an apartment because my previous property manager never responded to the new agency's request for information about my previous tenancy. In fact, my old property management agency kept giving me the contact information of an employee who no longer worked there, but still had a voicemail set up, so I wasted two weeks trying to contact someone who didn't even work there. Because the new company wouldn't rent to me without the information from my previous most recent landlord, I had to give up and was not allowed to live in the apartment I wanted to. It was infuriating."
Ability to have pets and some accountability from owner to perform maintenance 
"The current fixed term rental leases do not gel with the reality of moving house which is a variable event.
As tenants are required to be given 2 months notice to vacate without ground, it is not realistic to pay rent to the end of the fixed term lease and move out in one day.  There is always an overlap where the tenant has to pay double rent.  Recently, I moved out after 4 years within one month (one month early) thinking that was the right thing to do, however, I was ordered by the Tribunal to pay the owner 2 weeks rent.  The owner let me off for 2 weeks.  My solution is to include in the fixed term lease a period of possibly 2 weeks to a month that is variable or at risk.  That is, the tenant has 2 months to move out, however they are allowed to move out up to 2 or maybe 4 weeks prior to the end of the lease without penalty.  This would give more power to the tenant when asked to move without ground and would avoid the tenant having to pay double rent.  At the moment, the legislation gives all the power to the owner to receive rent until the last day of the fixed term lease.  Next time, unless I have agreement from the owner, I will not start looking to month 2 and then I cannot guarantee I will be able to move exactly on the date of the end of lease.  I potentially will have to break the law and go over my lease to abide by the law which was the advise given to me by the conciliator and the judge, so next time this is what I will be forced to do.  "
Shorter timeframes for landlords to evict tenants for non payment of rent
"Reduced inspection frequency: every 3 months is too much. Repetitive, intrusive."
The cost of renting would be helpful.  
"Being a long term excellent renter, I find the 6 monthly inspections invasive. If there is a problem with the property, I am perfectly capable of reporting it. I can assess the property a lot better than a property manager can in less than 5 minutes. "
The dispute resolution process.
"When agents are used as an intermediary, there can be a lack of professionalism in dealing with renters. I have seen this poor behaviour back in 1996, when renting and the agents are very poorly trained. The same behaviour can be seen recently (2018). "
Good clear communication with Property Manager on what the expectations and obligations are. I think more training and education would be beneficial on both sides. 
"Remove two weeks advance payment on-top of bond.

Apply policy that rentsl properties should be made compulsory to have furnishing.

"
"Only one? You're kidding! No charges on bank transfers for rent payments for starters: some are blatantly exorbitant.
Then there's the issue of invasion of privacy with general happy snap photographs being taken of general room views on every inspection. Sure, there's laws against that but without prescribed penalties for agents and staff breaching those penalties the law is nothing but a toothless tiger, and rental agencies know it."
The complete power landlords have and the inability for renters to access fair representation. 
Have stricter penalties for property managers that do not comply with their obligations.  Have minimum maintenance timeframes so repairs are carried out when required.
"Controls on what the owner can request from an applicant for a tenancy, and the banning of databases where real estates blacklist renters who have challenged a claim on their bond etc."
"Our rent being no higher than 1/3 our wage so we can actually afford property upkeep, would be a good start."
Minimum standards for maintenance of property
I would like to see an improvement in Rental property descriptions were they are accurate and contained real factual descriptions of the property (e.g. a dining room is not an additional bedroom). Not exaggerated and embellished property descriptions that falsely leads a prospective tenant to an inappropriate property and is a waste of my time - especially when you are working full time and have little time to be looking.
Permanent tenancies combined with tight regulation and control of rent increases.
Most of it is pretty good. Needing to have Rent increases being justified would be a nice addition to stop places doing a generic $10 p/week price rise every new lease then when the tenant moves out due to the high price they advertise it at a lower price to get another tenant in and the cycle starts again. 
"Reduce/remove the number of entries/inspections carried out throughout a 12month period. 4 times, taking photos every time is an invasion of privacy, and occurs a matter of weeks apart. As a tenant stays on longer and is proven to be a good tenant the frequency should be reduced. (I am also a landlord and would be happy for my managing real estate to do this.)"
Making it easier to get your bond back
Landlords and real estate agents who refuse repairs and maintenance must be penalized.  Currently there is no real way to force landlords to carry out maintenance.  
"I would make it mandatory for all rental properties to either have picture rails installed for tenant use or to allow nails to be put in walls. Its a very minor thing that would realistically have such a negligent impact on landlords, but in my experience, having lived in one property previously where there were picture rails so that I could hang and rearrange art and posters etc, it really allowed me to make my house (well, it was a unit) a home and that meant so much to me - its a huge gesture in terms of treating tenants with dignity and respect and not as second class citizens. "
The tenant eviction process.
When maintenance to a property is necessary the owner should be required to act quicker than they do eg mould in the rental that needs to be removed for health reasons
Better recourse for unpaid rent
less dependancy on private (individual) owners. Government owned like in Europe or larger organisations owned
"Ledger account kept correct and rental agencies only charging for correct fees not using fraudulent practices to rip off people by asking for incorrect rent, water etc especially when vacating a premise."
no rent increase for 3 to 5 years 
Better real estate agents and laws protecting property owners
"Better security of tenancy - for example protections against no-grounds evictions and unreasonable rent rises. Though there are many things I would change, this one change would make it more possible for myself and other tenants to better stand up for the rights that we do have in relation to repairs, inspections etc without fear of reprisal. As it stands, many people put up with unreasonable behaviour from lessors, because they know if they speak up, even for something they are entitled to such as timely repairs, they could be labelled a 'troublesome tenant' and lessor can simply choose to evict them without grounds or dramatically increase the rent. "
